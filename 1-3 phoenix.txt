Whoa! Stop waving that broom around!
Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?
Young...? Like, how young?
Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?
Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.
I really worry about kids these days.
I guess... Wish we had some clients!
A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?
Hmph.
H-hello? This is Phoenix.
Maya? What? It's still early...
Huh? You mean the guy on that show?
... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?
Yeah, on TV.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
(Maya's here... watching television.)
... This has to be a joke.
W-what!?
Go? Go where?
So what!?
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.
Well, what should we do?
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)
Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
What about this?
(My poor, poor ego...)
What about this?
What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!
Whaddya mean "that guy"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.
Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?
(This is getting off to a great start.)
What?
Yeah.
...
Smile for the camera...
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Um, here.
(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)
I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...
(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)
Well, what should we do?
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)
I dunno! It's possible.
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Hammer...?
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
(Absolutely not!)
Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.
Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Thank you for the letter of request.
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)
Hey, look what I have!
You mean Will Powers said we'd need it...?
*sigh*
Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.
Really?
Huh?
Hey! Not bad!
Umm... so?
I think you hurt his feelings.
Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt.
I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Hey, there's a camera here.
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Thanks for cheering me up...
About the security lady...
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
What kind of evidence!?
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Don't look so happy when you say that.
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Maybe... it was you?
(She thinks I was joking.)
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
("Was"? Past tense?)
About the security camera...
Don't look at me! How should I know?
What do you think?
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
...
Hmm... right.
I have to ask him about that photograph!
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
You just had a burger!
(What!?)
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
What do you mean "find"!?
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
(Ladies first...)
(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
("Kinda"...?)
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.
Hey, don't open that.
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
You just had a burger!
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
W-wait! No, that's mine!
W... well you'll just have to wait!
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...
It opened!
(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)
Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!
What is it?
You're real quiet all of a sudden.
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...
...
(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
(I think she's being serious...!)
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Oh. Right.
That's a "step"-ladder.
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...
Umm... who are you?
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
("I think" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)
Um, any thoughts about this?
Hmm...
Not really.
You "sensed"?
Some other studio employees, maybe?
R-really!?
Yeah, you're right.
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?
She left...
Hmm. That's definitely a possibility.
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)
(Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.)
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
There! Entered!
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
There! Entered!
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
There! Entered! ...
Let's see what we got... ... Huh?
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?
Yeah.
Right, we'll put her in her place...
Wait. Let's not.
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?
No clues here.
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
(I think I can probably remember that...)
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)
Yes, Your Honor.
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
A "run-through"...?
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
What kind of "errands"?
Answer the question!
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Did you see the victim then?
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Why don't you raise an objection?
How did you know that?
(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)
2:00? You're sure?
Leads to:
So you saw Mr. Powers?
Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...
Leads to:
Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)
What!?
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)
(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)
Umm...
(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)
(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)
Who was present at the run-through?
What about the assistant?
(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)
"Trip and fall"...?
Where was the assistant then?
(Hmm...)
He broke a prop?
(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)
(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)
Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?
(Thus the nap...)
(Dragging his foot... okay.)
Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)
Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!
(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)
Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...
(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)
How do you know that?
(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)
Are you absolutely sure!?
(Nobody suspicious lookin'... Right.)
Leads to:
What about before you got to the guard station?
Leads to:
Are you sure!?
(E-Edgey-boy...?)
Leads to:
Old windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.
(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)
Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?
So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?
Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.
That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]
Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: "Photo #2"...
The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be "Photo #1" if it really was the ONLY photo!?
Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access... the security lady herself!
But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!
Another "job"?
How many photos are there, usually?
How exactly do you determine what isn't "suspicious lookin'"?
F-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!
(I think she's missing the point.)
Leads to:
Classic old windbag maneuver, Maya.
(Let's find out more about this "erased" photo.)
Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?
F-fanboy?
W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? "I locked the main gate so no one could get in"... Those were your words!
They come in through the drain?
And...?
K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Yeah, and they're already trying to "un-suspect" him.
Mr. WP?
Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?
It doesn't look good...
You're the only likely suspect, right now.
First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!
Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.
I'm not optimistic at all, actually.
Okay. Let's go. *sigh*
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
That's correct, Your Honor!
Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)
What about the assistant?
Ungh!
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?
(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!
The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!
Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!
(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)
(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)
(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)
(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)
The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!
You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)
That boy is not the killer.
I have proof.
The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?
Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!
This is my proof!
S-sorry, Your Honor.
(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)
N-not to talk about?
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)
(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)
So, you were told not to talk?
W-who were these people!?
The... director?
So, where were these people?
S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)
(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)
(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)
Ms. Oldbag! This is a trial for murder!
(So, you got your "bonus" and you still talked... Hmm. I think I've asked all the questions I have to ask...)
(I guess there's no harm in getting as much info as I can!)
So they were actually in the studio!?
(I feel sorry for Edgeworth, almost. She really left him hanging on this one.)
"Them"...? W-who were these people!?
The... director?
So, where were these people?
S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)
(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)
(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)
Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!
We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!
What do you think, Mr. Powers?
Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.
Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Huh? Really?
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
(W-what!? I see plenty of room! It’s still wide open... no?)
Whew, what a day.
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.
Yeah, them.
What do you think we should do?
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Hey, see this?
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)
Me!? Why me!?
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.
Let's not.
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.
This guard monitors the visitor's room.
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
(Whose side is she on!?)
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Regarding this photograph...
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
But who else could have worn it!?
(But who!?)
Regarding the murder weapon...
Is it heavy, that spear?
Hmm...
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.
Yeah, I think that's what they said.
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
(But... but I AM still young!)
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.
Yeah... It is a murder scene.
(*sigh*...)
Yeah! So don't touch it!
S-stop that!
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
(I think she's being serious...!)
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
I thought so...
No, that it does not.
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
What is it with steaks around here?
What?
There's a big "2" painted here.
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Sure... if I had a license.
But, look, I have this!
There're some flowers here.
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.
These look like materials for making a movie set.
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.
Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!
You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)
(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
What, you want to rip the grate off?
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
(Sometimes...?)
The things we do...
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
H-hey! We're not thieves!
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Be my guest.
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.
Huh... (She's got a point!)
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
("Kinda"...?)
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
W-what now?
... Then don't eat them.
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
So, how are the studios doing?
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
(The producer, huh?)
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.
Could you take a look at this?
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)
P-"Pink Princess"...?
Maya, we really need to talk about "cool"...
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees.
W-what now?
(She's biting her lip and staring at me with tears welling in her eyes...)
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
That's right.
A t-bone steak, was it?
No idea...
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Were all of them with you the entire time?
(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)
How do you know?
(Oh, right. The director would know about the injury; he was there.)
(This place is deserted...)
Someone must be inside...
No answer.
I'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked.
No. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate.
(If they'll let us...)
The trailer door. It's locked. The key is probably in the security guard station. I doubt they'd let us borrow it.
You... certainly got back to your post quickly.
Mr. Powers is pretty tall...
(I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.)
(This lady's too much...)
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
(Guess I'd better investigate there later...)
Umm, about that kid you said you saw...
(I have a feeling she's not going to respond well to anything I show her now.)
(I'll bet he came in right through that drain...)
(You got to hand it to Maya, she's pretty sharp. And pretty mad...)
The drain where the fanboy came in. He didn't waste any time coming in, either. Talk about cause and effect.
So, you're a fan of the Steel Samurai?
(What are they doing!?)
Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day?
Did you see anything...?
?
A... bottle? Why was this sitting there, I wonder?
Anyway, what was that kid saying?
Odd of her to leave her post...
Y-yeah. Sounds like she's chasing after that boy.
(Maya sure looks happy...)
Good idea.
The key to that trailer in Studio Two!
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.
I wonder if the key we borrowed from the guard station will work? ... It opened.
(She seems eager all of a sudden...)
(Ah, not THAT eager.)
The trailer door. It's unlocked.
(Dee Vasquez... She's quite beautiful.)
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster's quite old.
A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse?
An old movie poster. "'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star.
This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around.
Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents.
It looks like they were designing a set to use for the Steel Samurai show. They've got some figures for how much the set costs... I can't believe they spend that much money on those sets!
The glass is frosted. I can't see outside. This far into October, the dimming daylight makes it feel like winter's coming.
I was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder...
M-Ms. Vasquez?
E-excuse me?
A s-script?
... (We're getting nowhere fast.)
Ms. Vasquez?
Hey, don't get mad at me.
About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...?
It's starting to look like it.
Y-yeah.
Y-yes?
Don't cry. She'll take it as a sign of weakness. Alright. We'll give it to him if we see him.
Here. I got this from the producer...
I agree.
(The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere?
Good work!
We found your script.
(Well, she's certainly not NORMAL...)
Here, we found it! Your script!
... Umm... uh... You're not going to talk to us?
Yes. With the director and the people from the network...
The... path?
On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?
M-"Mr. Monkey"?
Oh, right, that... (What an original name...)
B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!
(It IS a monkey, after all.)
2:15...?
Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...
(It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...)
I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came.
This is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00.
I see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by "ook"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now.
Now what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim.
Huh?
M-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!?
Right! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble.
What did you mean, we have one lead...?
I dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all.
(Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...)
Um, well, Maya has actually... I think maybe she's giving it too much.
(The plant's name is... Charley?)
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. Oh, hey! Mia, what's the name of this movie?
(Let me guess... it's a suspense thriller?)
So, what's the best thing to do from here?
So, do you have any ideas about who might have done this?
(Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...)
(You sure are talking enough!)
I guess Mr. Powers is in questioning...
W-what's wrong?
(She's been chasing that boy this whole time.)
(Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.)
(A "hostage"...!?)
Umm... what happened to the boy?
Actually, I met with the director just now...
(Is she okay!?)
(Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.)
What's this about a "hostage"?
(It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.)
(Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I...
(A trade, hmm... I wonder...?)
Right. A cardkey to Studio One.
You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag?
(If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!)
Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there.
(Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?)
(Well, at least she's consistent...)
Ms. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know.
(She's not as demanding when she's exhausted.)
(She's too busy catching her breath to tell me anything!)
I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag.
What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?
Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the "hostage" she was talking about.)
(There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...)
"Welcome"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too.
A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.
A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.
A panel for reflecting light. They call it a "reflecting board" or something.
A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.
A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
There's a big "2" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.
These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.
The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.
Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?
Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!
Yeah. His name's "Cody Hackins."
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Where have I heard that line before...?
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!
S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?
Slamming spaghetti. Right...
He's sure to be in here somewhere... Found you!
Dammit! He's getting away!
(How did she...!?)
And I'm Phoenix Wright!
(I'm not so sure I'm qualified...)
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)
Mr. Powers's bag.
H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)
There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.
O-oh, nothing.
The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the "bomb."
H-hey, watch that attitude!
So, do you know anything about what happened here? Could you tell me, please?
(Hmm... looks like a little persuasion's necessary. Maybe a bribe...?)
(This kid and Maya would get along great.)
Cody... This look familiar?
"You are"... huh?
I'll give you this... IF you help me.
(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Huh?
(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?
Hello. What brings you here?
Yes?
Um, nope! She's the same as always.
Have you seen that boy since then?
Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?
(Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.)
Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?
But... his popularity had been waning recently, right?
After WHAT happened?
No, what?
Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer?
(Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?)
Do you know anything about this?
A complete set?
Huh...
Uh...
T-trade with you?
Trade me a... huh?
(W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?)
Okay.
No... no, I can't. See, this card isn't really even mine.
O-o-okay, okay! I'll trade!
(And there she goes...)
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
See this card?
(Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade?
No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information.
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
I... I guess.
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai.
R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy!
Yeah...
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...
(You're calling ME hard-core?)
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!
What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)
(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
I... I guess.
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
You were here on the day of the... incident, right?
Did you see anything unusual?
(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)
Thanks for this.
(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)
Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.
(Umm... right.) Mia?
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!
Let's not call him then...
W-what're we going to do, Mia!
Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!
Of course he is!
(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)
(Uh oh, she's mad.)
Great! Thanks, Mia!
No clues here.
Yes?
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.
Something "overlooked"...?
(This isn't going to be easy.)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(I wonder if that producer is going to come out...)
(... or that director.)
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)
Yes, Your Honor.
Is that when you always come in to work?
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
In the Employee Area?
Was anyone else at the run-through?
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Why did it go on so long?
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)
What exactly did they have for lunch?
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
That must have been tough.
Yeah?
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table. There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area. Who ate lunch there?
A t-bone steak, you mean?
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
What were you discussing?
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?
You didn't take a single break?
(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)
You didn't take a single break?
(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)
(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)
R-right!
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?
Well?
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)
What time exactly did you take this break?
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Why is that?
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!
(Oh, great. Is that all...)
What!?
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
What's your point, Edgeworth!
The Court Record...?
Whoa! You're right!
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
(Wh-what? It's over?)
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)
(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)
(He's having trouble with this "gentle" thing.)
(A very long day...)
Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?
(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)
You really like the Steel Samurai, huh?
That's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park?
(Poor, poor Dad...)
Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio?
"Off the path"...?
I see.
Did nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio?
Did you see this monkey by any chance?
You got lost in the woods?
The Steel Samurai?
I see. What then?
What sort of "bad guy" was it?
Are you sure it was a guy?
(Huh, he's being awfully vague...)
What happened to the bad guy?
Y-yes, I suppose he was.
"If" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then?
(Really...?)
Leads to:
(I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)
(Easy for you to say...)
Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.
Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?
(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)
It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)
Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?
I don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!
Well, Cody?
So, why didn't you use it?
So you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight?
You didn't turn away, not even once?
Okay, then tell us exactly what happened.
So the bad guy attacked him first?
What sort of person was this "bad guy"?
How was he dressed?
Why?
Why wasn't the bad guy moving?
And how exactly did he do that?
(He's still being vague about this...)
(How should I play this?)
(Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.)
What did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody?
(Something isn't adding up here...)
(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)
Cody.
Something's bothering me. Before you said that you "couldn't take your eyes off" the action.
Yet you missed the most important part!
You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a "Samurai Slap"!?
My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!
Um, well... er, that's the thing...
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Umm... huh.
He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!
O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)
Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.
Your Honor, I have evidence.
Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?
Leads to:
Here's my proof!
Um, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!)
Here's my proof!
The witness stated that he recently received this camera.
He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.
Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!
Bullseye!
(Pressing, not picking...)
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?
R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.
(Welcome to the real world, kid!)
I'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.
"Pops"...?
G-geezer...?
Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify!
So you did see the beginning of the fight?
Did you notice anything unusual?
(Moving... strangely?)
Why couldn't you take a picture?
When the lens opened, what did you see?
That's all?
(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)
(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)
(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!
(Bullseye...?)
I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!
(This feels great!)
You "erased" them?
Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?
(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)
Leads to:
(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)
Cody!
I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.
What was it you told me then?
Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?
It's called "Path to Glory." It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!
Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!
Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)
M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?
I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an "artiste."
He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!
Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the reall reason is...
Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!
Huh? You mean, that wasn't it?
Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?
I can think of only one reason, your honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.
Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!
Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!
Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?
Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!
Apparently, we have all made a serious error.
Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!
Right.
... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
There was no victim in this case!
Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!
(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!
That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.
That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?
Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.
I... don't know.
?
Huh, me? What?
Data?
! W-what!?
I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.
Mia? What?
Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?
(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)
Leads to:
It's right here!
Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.
I think it's here.
I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.
Yes, please, Your Honor.
Your Honor! Look at this!
Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate?
Clearly not a "1," Your Honor, correct?
I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.
I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say "1" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)
Leads to:
It was here!
Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.
Here, at Studio Two.
Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!
As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!
The path to the trailer was blocked!

Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to
Studio Two is no longer being used for filming!
(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)
S-stabbing away, Your Honor.
The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!
W-well, no, of course not...
I have proof!
(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)
(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)
Your Honor...
Actually... I do have proof.
Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!
Leads to:
(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)
Y-yes, Your Honor!
This is it.
I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads "sleeping pills."
The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!
Your Honor, I have an idea.
Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.
(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)
Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.
I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)
I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!
Yes, Your Honor?
(That's a lot of homework!)
Whew! That was a close one!
M-me too!
Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.
(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Huh? Really?
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
(Uh oh...)
That was a close one, huh, Mia?
? M-Maya!
Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.
Under the "initial trial" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.
That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.
Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!
I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?
Yeah!
That's what we have to find out.
Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer.
Which means that the killer has to be one of them!
Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!
(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)
Well, have you noticed anything that might help us?
Right...
(WP... Powers... right.)
(Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.)
Me!? Why me!?
What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession.
These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.
Um, yeah, whatever you say.
This is Cody's--
(I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...)
Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?
You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.
Please... this is no laughing matter.
Here's that picture again.
He's the only one who it could have been.
You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?
(Look at us, the two novices.)
Have you seen this, Mr. Powers?
These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.
Y-yeah?
Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer.
(She seems bitter...)
Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?
Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya.
About Mr. Hammer...
(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)
Um, Ms. Oldbag?
Um, Ms. Oldbag? What do you think of this?
Right.
Studio Two is down that way. Studio Two... the real scene of the crime.
Well... ... Actually, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time.
The mascot of Global Studios. Apparently its name is "Mr. Monkey."
This security camera takes photos of everyone who comes through the gate. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. I don't have that cardkey anymore, so I can't go in there today.
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Sure, if Ms. Oldbag lets us in.
M-Maya! You should at least try to be polite...
(That's all she had to say, apparently...)
This is where Sal Manella and Dee Vasquez ate. There's nothing left on the plates.
Something wrong?
Can't say that I do...
There's a big "2" painted here. So this is the number in Cody's photograph. And to think, if he hadn't brought that photograph in...
There're some flowers here.
Don't get too close. That fence looks dangerous.
The trailer door. It's locked.
(Oh dear...)
(Oh dear...)
Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about Mr. Manella?
(Oh, oh dear...)
(She's not even looking.) Okay. Hey, you look.
I guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed.
An old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?
This trial will be over and done by tomorrow. You can come see them film later.
Uh huh.
("Dramatique" indeed...)
Wait, are you looking for sleeping pills?
That grate's still lying here.
That poor assistant...
The remains of the employees' lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal.
So there were sleeping pills on the plate!
How goes your investigation?
How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?
Whoa...
Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle?
(So I was right!)
Detective, about that bottle...
I'm sure Mr. Powers will be back soon. He'll be fine...
There's an array of cosmetics here. This is the wig used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey."
Thanks to you...
There are some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Looks like someone was sleeping here.
I'm not sure being drugged counts as taking a "nap"...
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I always check my hairdo when I look in a mirror. Hmm... not quite as spiky as usual, I see.
Mr. Powers's bag.
Soon, soon.
There's a box for snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Hmm. It's completely empty. ... I can feel Maya's eyes burning into the back of my neck.
Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez?
Why is that?
Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?
(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)
(Five years ago...?)
Looks like someone was sleeping here.
It's Powers's bag.
I'm sure he'll come, yes.
I was wondering if I could ask you about Mr. Hammer...
On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two.
(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)
Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?
Umm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this.
Leads to:
Penny:
This is why you can't stop the Steel Samurai.
F-funny that. I don't either! (Oops. Let's try that again.)
A fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone.
Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.
An accident five years ago?
Could you tell us what happened?
Could you tell us what happened five years ago?
And that's the "dirt" she had on Mr. Hammer?
Thanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...)
It seems that way.
An empty bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it...
Umm... I wanted to ask you about five years ago...
I, uh... huh?
N-nickels?
O-oh, right. Anyway, we heard about the accident. It was during filming with Jack Hammer... He killed a man. Didn't he?
N-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers...
(Proof that Hammer stole Powers's costume? Hmm...)
Proof? Well... no.
(She knows something! But how am I going to get her to talk...?)
I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume.
Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?
This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate!
Except, I have proof that Mr. Hammer put the pills in.
Leads to:
Oldbag:
(Hmm... wrong evidence? But I know Oldbag knows something! I have to get her to talk!)
This bottle contained sleeping pills. Mr. Hammer's fingerprints were found on the bottle.
Here's my proof.
It's a bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it...
Leads to:
Oldbag:
(Hmm... wrong evidence? But I know Oldbag knows something! I have to get her to talk!)
Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?
This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate!
Oldbag:
(Hmm... wrong evidence? But I know Oldbag knows something! I have to get her to talk!)
Ms. Oldbag...
...? A photograph? W-wait a second!
Is... this the trailer in Studio Two?
B-but how did you get this?
I understand...
He's probably thinking about what to do in tomorrow's trial.
(She's not even looking.)
Wh-what?
I, well...
O-Old...?
Right... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer!
The... huh?
(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!
What do you mean?
...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose?
Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?
(... So that's why she had the photo...)
... U-umm... Who are they...?
Wh-what!?
... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's "dirt"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all?
(And who's at the bottom...? Dee Vasquez!)
No clues here.
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)
R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)
By yourself?
And you didn't stop in at the Employee Area?
... Are you always this... terse?
(Oh dear...)
Did no one leave during the meeting?
... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that.
And when exactly was that?
...
Maybe you could try remembering?
(You "would think"!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)
Hold on! You had Sal "take" you? What does that mean!?
(Oh... oh, right.)
And what were you doing during that time...?
Do you have someone who can verify this?
N-no... I mean someone else?
(If she committed murder during that break... She wouldn't have had time to eat a t-bone steak! If I had some evidence that proved she didn't eat that steak...)
Leads to:
I kind of wish she'd said a little more...
Hah! As I thought!
You claim you ate a t-bone steak! But I say you did not!
Look at this.
This plate was on the table in the employee room. As you can see, a large bone has been left behind.
Exactly my point! Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!
Ms. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!
You ate the bone, too!
Hey, I don’t eat it either!
Um, can I try that again?
Elementary! You were eating a boneless steak!
... Um, right, Your Honor.
Correct! I was... testing you!
Sorry... Can I try that one more time?
You didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!
Isn’t it obvious, Your Honor?
She was picking on Mr. Manella!
Oh...?
Y-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best.
She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!
Yes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!
Yes.
(Any day, Vasquez!)
Yes...?
It's not impossible!
Umm... er...
Something odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!
S-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.
(Ugh...)
Let's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!
I think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.
Yes...
I don't know.
I don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...
However, that has no bearing on this case!
The Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!
I have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!
Leads to:
Judge:
But I haven’t said anything yet...?
(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here’s the real evidence, Your Honor.
I present my proof: the so-called "murder weapon"!
Not so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!
Of course I can't.
(Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...)
Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?
Leads to:
Maya:
Huh? Think?
(Hmm. She has a point.)
N-no, Your Honor. Nothing!
Look at this photo.
This photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.
Mr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?
Yes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!
It's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.
Precisely. Ironic, isn’t it?
You deny that what I say is true?
...
15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...
Not agreed!
You’d be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!
(Let me guess: "Show Me Proof!")
(How am I supposed to do that...?)
(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)
What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?
Actually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.
Leads to:
Dee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!
Your Honor?
Umm...
Ms. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!
Recall your testimony...
You used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!
Of course he wasn't!
... Of course I'm not serious.
I was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?
(I... win!?) ...
Umm... So... what happens next?
Don't "?" me! Don’t you have anything to say!?
Huh? "I lost"? Something like that!
W-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...
Huh?
R-right!
Wha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?
(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)
(Urk! What do I do now!?)
Ms. Vasquez! You did it!
... Um, did you do it?
Y-yes, Your Honor?
I... I'd like you to testify again!
Uh...
...
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.
(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)
Who knows? He probably realized she did it, too.
(Edgeworth...)
Right!
What time was that?
When exactly did you and Mr. Manella arrive at the studio?
(Hmm...)
Where were the other employees when you got to the studio?
Well!? Then you could have put Hammer in that costume, with Sal Manella's help!
(B-boy!?)
(I'd better leave this one be. I'm sure she'd see through anything I had to throw at her, anyway.)
Mr. Powers was taking a nap, correct?
Did no one go to call him?
Remember... what?
(You certainly seemed calm enough when I accused you of murder! *sigh*)
Wait a second! Wouldn't that be the other way around!?
You discovered a murdered body, and one person was missing, right? Wouldn't you normally go looking for the missing person!?
(Poor Powers...)
(I'll hold off. She'd just blow off anything I had to say, anyway.)
What was everyone else doing at that time?
...
(Oldbag... the security lady.) Why did the security lady think Powers had done it?
(Right... the Steel Samurai.)
Did the detective arrest Mr. Powers based solely on the security lady's word?
(That photograph... meaning the one taken by the security camera.)
(Hmm. I don't think there's anything in there I can use.)
(I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.)
You "asked to be left out"?
But, you can't decide who the police will and won't question!
(Covered for you... or covered it up for you? There must have been a lot riding on it, with all those bigwigs at the meeting... I'm sure her "professionals" helped convince everyone they didn't require questioning.)
The script and your direction notes?
No, I guess not.
(I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.)
Wait a second! I thought you came to Studio One for a rehearsal! Why didn't you bring your script and notes!?
Why?
(Oh, yeah, I guess...)
(Huh...!?)
(I can't believe Edgeworth is helping me!)
So you weren't questioned?
Thinking back to when we first began this trial... We were under the impression that there was no one in the trailer at all.
Why is that?
(She has got to be the least guilt-ridden guilty person I've ever met...)
(I'll hold back for now. I'm sure she's anticipated anything I had to say...)
How did you know about the injury?
(Sal the director... Hm...)
Leads to:
You "knew that Hammer was injured"...? Don't you think that's a little funny? I mean, it was the Steel Samurai who was injured! It was Will Powers!
Yes, Mr. Hammer is dragging his leg in this photo. But that's because he was pretending to be Mr. Powers!
One person was inured in the run-through that morning. That person was Mr. Powers, not Mr. Hammer! Now, why did you think it was Mr. Hammer who was injured?
I think not. Mr. Manella was at the run-through that morning. He would have known it was Mr. Powers who was injured. He saw it happen! Why would he tell you the wrong person? Ms. Vasquez!
You must have heard Mr. Manella wrong! Even though he said Mr. Powers was injured... You thought he was talking about Mr. Hammer!
Yeah! ...
Oh, right... I kind of talked myself out of that one, didn't I?
Actually, you didn't hear anything from Mr. Manella. You saw Mr. Hammer limping with your own eyes!
Yes, but remember! Mr. Hammer was dragging his leg, too! He was pretending to be Mr. Powers!
And when was he doing this...?
Exactly! Ms. Vasquez! You met him, didn't you? You saw the Steel Samurai limping! And Mr. Hammer was in that Steel Samurai suit! That's why you were confused! That's why you thought it was Mr. Hammer who had been injured that morning!
(Yeah, let's see you sneak out of this one, Vasquez!)
(Urk... Why are the real killers always so... persistent?)
But... but what proof could I possibly have!?
Ugh...
Okay. I have proof, and I'll show it to you! I present to the court evidence as to Ms. Vasquez's motive in this murder.
Leads to:
Psst, Maya, look. This is it.
I was just testing it out on you.
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Yes... yes, Your Honor. Right. Here goes!
This is my proof!
This photo reveals the motive in this murder!
I'm right, aren't I, Ms. Vasquez?
Five years ago, Mr. Hammer was at the height of his fame. With Dee Vasquez's help, a terrible accident was swept under the carpet... Ladies and gentlemen, the case currently up for trial... It began on that day, five years ago!
Ironically enough, that accident precipitated Mr. Hammer's fall... His fall from stardom!
However! You, Dee Vasquez, used Mr. Hammer. You made him work for you for petty change!
Yes! Undoubtedly, it was a constant source of shame for the ex-star...
Okay... Allow me to present to the court evidence proving Ms. Vasquez's motive!
Leads to:
This is my proof!
(Urk!)
She had no motive, Your Honor.
It was Mr. Hammer who was out for blood! All Ms. Vasquez did was push him off the stairs... in self defense!
It's simple! Mr. Hammer was intending to kill Ms. Vasquez!
Your Honor! Jack Hammer drugged Mr. Powers with sleeping pills! Jack Hammer snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume! Jack Hammer wore the costume to fool the security lady into thinking he was Powers! Then Jack Hammer made his way to the trailer! And for what purpose, you ask? To kill Dee Vasquez, who had so cruelly taken advantage of him all those years!
So, you did do it, didn't you?
Yes, Your Honor?
I... thank you, Your Honor.
I’m just glad you’re okay.
H-huh?
I guess we'll never know.
(Whew... I'm not sure I wanted to go down that road.)
Well, this is what I think. Mr. Hammer wanted to put the blame on you because...
It's because you were the Steel Samurai.
Mr. Hammer was a big star, once. But he was reduced to acting in a kids' show... and as the villain, to boot! The kids love the Steel Samurai. And so, he hated you.
(I think you’re missing the point...)
(So am I... so am I...)
Will:
Yeah, what does that mean, Maya?
(Oh...)
...
Huh? What? ... Umm... that was too bad, Edgeworth!
No... I really wanted to thank you. Vasquez would have gotten away if you hadn't stepped in.
(Liar!)
Unnecessary feelings?
Aren’t those kind of necessary?
For now we are... I guess.
And so the curtain closes on another trial... I caused quite a stir by revealing that accident from five years ago. It was the talk of the town. Thankfully, Global Studios rethought its programming change. They went back to making kids' shows again.
(I'll admit, I was kind of surprised... I didn't think they'd seriously go through with it...)
Fine, fine. I'll do it.
I dunno... I don't think the world is ready for the real Will Powers...
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Huh? Really?
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
(Uh oh...)

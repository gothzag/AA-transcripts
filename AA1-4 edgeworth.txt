What are you doing here!?
So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?
... Yes you do.
... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.
... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!
Yes... late last night.
... I see no need to tell you.
... Gourdy.
I went to see Gourdy.
Your attorney's badge...?
... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.
Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.
Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I
Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.
... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Stay out of this case.
I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?
... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!
What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.
... I'm sorry. I can't think of anything I want to say about that.
Hmph... Who would have thought there'd be a photo...?
... What do you think, Wright?
No, I didn't. It wasn't me.
What's this? I was hoping you'd gotten my message the first time.
...! It's no concern of yours.
Wright. I'll ask you again, just leave me alone.
Please try to understand. I'm not doing this to prove I'm tough, or because I look down on you. I just don't want you anywhere
I have no intention of telling you.

...
The "DL-6 Incident"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.
My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a
Correct.
What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.
The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.
I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.
He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently.
... I'd rather not talk about it.
Your attorney's badge...? I can't say I really want to see one of those right now.
...! ...
It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit
Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded
I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to
... Wright.
It pains me to ask you this now...
Yes... Will you?
Not me.
Wright...
There was nothing little...
Thank you, Wright.
Pay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you.
Huh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe.
That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god
He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.
Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.
He taught me what it really means to "prosecute."
Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.
Something like that...
Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!
Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors.
What are you whispering about?
Uh... hmm...
True...
... Yes. It was me.
But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.
I... don't know.
... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the
... That's the only explanation I can come up with.
W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...
...
No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.
... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!
Hmph.
Oh... Wright.
Tell her something for me.
... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.
Hmph. I've seen worse.
...
... Huh? You say something, Wright?
It... it's nothing.
What's that?
Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I
Wright...
This might be our chance.
von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.
Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever
It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.
Yes.
... What Wright has said was mostly correct. Astonishingly so, actually. Yes... Several days ago, I received a letter. The
... I'm sorry. I can't say what it was.
...
! D-did you say something?
... I'm sorry... But... I fear it's not over for me yet.
Wright... There's something that's been troubling me for a long time now. And I don't know whether or not to tell you...
No... there's so little time left. I want to tell you, to get it off my chest, but... ... Hmm. I can't make up my mind. ...
... It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed.
A memory... of a murder.
A memory of a crime... that I committed. A memory... of a murder.
It wasn't you who stole my money, was it?
"Then you shouldn't apologize! Everyone's been shouting you did it, but no one has any proof! That is why, Your Honor, this
I'm going to become a defense attorney, just like my Dad! A famous defense attorney!"""
...
Hmph.
Class trial? What do you mean?
No, I don't.
Lunch money...? ... Oh... Oh, right. Yes, I seem to remember something like that.
... Ridiculous!
That said... It does sound like that kind of thing you'd do. You haven't changed a bit, have you, Wright? So...simple. To a
... Perhaps.
... I couldn't let myself deny reality like you.
My father was taken from me, and you want me to defend criminals? I'm sorry, Wright, but I'm not that good of a person!
Yes. The man trapped in the elevator with my father. His name... was Yanni Yogi. He had to be the shooter, any way you look at
On that day, 15 years ago... The three of us were trapped in that elevator for five hours. When we were rescued, we all
Even now, I can't recall what happened in that elevator. That was the crux of Yogi's argument in court. He claimed Yanni Yogi
He's my teacher, and a man who deserves respect. I learned everything I know of courtroom techniques from him.
He is a perfectionist in all things. In court... In his personal life... He is obsessed with doing everything perfectly.
In all the cases he has taken on, none were left unsolved. And not one suspect was declared innocent. Ever.
I know. It's possible some of the suspects were indeed innocent. However, it is impossible for us to accurately determine that
Mmph... It's a strange situation in which I find myself, I'll admit.
What are you showing me this picture for?
... You know, I was impressed by your deduction in the trial today. Granted, you were at the end of your rope, but still.
... It was that case that changed my life. And tomorrow, on December 28, its statute of limitations runs out.
But... even if the case is finally closed on paper... It will never be erased from my memory. Never...
What is it?
Huh?
Sorry. I'm not sure I can help you with that.
Yanni Yogi was a court bailiff at the time. We just happened to be in that elevator together 15 years ago. The quake was
That's all I remember... When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling.In court, Yanni Yogi's mental
... Wright.
There's something that's been troubling me these last few days. I... didn't know whether or not I should tell you.
It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed.
...A memory... of a murder.
I think... I think the time has come to tell all.
For the last 15 years, I've had the same dream almost every night. I wake up in a fearful sweat, every time.
It's a dream about my father's killing... in the dark.
Then I see the pistol lying by my feet. I don't know if it was evidence from that day in court, or the bailiff's... In a daze,
(Get away...! Get away from my father!)
And with that scream... I wake. It's a bone-chilling scream. A scream that has rung in my ears for the past 15 years.
... That thought is the only thing that has kept me sane for the last 15 years. But what if I'm wrong? What if it's real? They
If you think about it that way, this letter makes sense. "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth." Think about it. Yogi was
It was me. I was the true criminal of DL-6. I shot my father!
Hmm?
I see... ...! Revenge... on me?
I... I don't know.
Nice, Wright. But I don't remember that old man. Not at all.
Which means there was someone else behind it!
Two men... meaning myself and Robert Hammond?
... Wait... Wait, that old man...!
Yogi... Could he be Yogi!?
The suspect in the DL-6 Incident. The one who was found innocent.
...
... Whooooooooaa! Wh-wh-what are you doing!?
Uh... good morning.
...
Judge:
Your Honor. I object to your judgment.
I'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?
For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I
From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the
I'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort.
I didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter
Wh-what!?
W-Wright...
Miles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.
... It is correct.
That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.
We were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.
That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.
I don't remember things very clearly. Only two things... I know my father lost, and Mr. von Karma was the prosecuting attorney.
As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.
Yes. Myself, my father, and Yanni Yogi. We were fine at first... But then as time passed, and no one came to help...
My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.
I was a nine-year-old boy at the time. What could I do? I was scared... Trembling, in the corner. But then...
Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.
A pistol. I assume it was the bailiff, Yanni Yogi's. The safety must have come off when it fell from his holster.
I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.
I think I knew. I knew it was dangerous. But... the air was getting so thick. I panicked.
I was... in a daze.
A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.
Yes... I think... after I threw it, I lost consciousness. Since then... They've echoed in my head, every day. That gunshot,
Yes. I'm sure of that. I heard the shot, and the scream... Then everything faded. I was unconscious until the rescuers came.
Yes. I'm sure of that. I heard the shot, and the scream... Then everything faded. I was unconscious until the rescuers came.
It was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.
Yes. I can practically hear it now. I doubt I will ever forget that scream as long as I live.
Yes, Your Honor.
No... No, I do not.
... Yes, I did.
von Karma!?
It's no use.
I know von Karma. Perhaps too well. He's perfect. He wouldn't leave clues. He probably didn't undergo surgery. That would
... You! It was you!
Ballistic markings...
That scream... I've heard that scream before... Wait... I know!
It's that scream I heard in the elevator! Fifteen years ago... von Karma! It was you who screamed!
So... it was you!
Yes, Your Honor.
...
Yes, Your Honor.
...
... Wright.
... I... I'm not sure how to say this.
I... I see. ... Th-thank you, Wright.
Oof! S-sorry... I'm not good at this sort of thing.
Mmm. I... I see. *ahem* Whooooooooooooop! ... I... I feel foolish.
Er... thank y'all very much.
You... were the witness on the first day of the trial, weren't you.
Um, yes, here I am.
Celebration? That's unusual for you.
Wright...
That envelope that Larry gave me. It's got money in it.
It's $38.00, Wright.
What are you so surprised about, Wright?
Larry was absent that day from school, right? But that doesn't automatically rule him out as a suspect.
Think back to that day, fifteen years ago. Larry took the day off, but he was bored, he came in to school anyway. Then he saw
I suspected. I just couldn't picture Larry protecting you like he did that day. Everyone else was saying you did it. The whole
Wright, you may not know this, but we used to have a saying back in school. "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
Really, Wright. I'm surprised you didn't figure it out!
Hmm?
I'd say so, yes.
Well, I'd call you a goody-two-shoes to the extreme.
The same goes for me, only the other way around... For the longest time, I thought that I might have killed my own father. I
Want to switch, Wright?
Hah! Don't think you've graduated yet, amateur!
Whoooooooooooooop! Detective Gumshooooooooooe!

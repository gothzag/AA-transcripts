Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?
Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!
Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!
I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.
I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!
I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!
Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.
Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.
There's a little shack down that way called, "Heavenly Hall".
It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.
Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is "Compton Castles"...
Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.
Pretty reckless, if you ask me.
Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.
You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, "Dusty Bridge". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.
... Ah! You're right! It's "Dusky Bridge" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!
Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!
Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!
Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!
It's simple!
Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!
Yeah, that Bikini lady.
...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.
Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... "Look before you cross," is how it goes, right? Or was that "leap"...?
Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.
Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.
Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.
We're almost 100% sure it was lightning.
Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country!
He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.
He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.
You bet he is! After all, "you know who" is right in the middle of it.
Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!
Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.
I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.
Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.
Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.
... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.
Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?
You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!
Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*
Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...
There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.
I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.
Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. "Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!"
R-Really? I thought so!
I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.
...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.
He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.
Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.
But he made me pay him 50 cents for it.
... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.
Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.
Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.
I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.
I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...
Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.
Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?
Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!
...*gasp!* ...
...Too late, I already did.
...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! "Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?
That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir!
That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!
A brilliant deduction, sir!
Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir!
Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about...
We call a person who tells a lie a "liar", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a "beller"? Or "truer" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight!
Say, this just gave me a great idea!
I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich!
Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a "Snow Car"!
So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that?
Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling?
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.
Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...
Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.
So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!
Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?
Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!
... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?
There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...
Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing "Happy Birthday" to me?
Huh...!? This is "lesser"!? What is the "greater" one like?
Hmm... Beats me.
Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!
Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!
Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!
It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. "tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed."
Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!
Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!
Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!
Sorry.
Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?
Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!
Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.
"Special Course"?
...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.
Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.
As they say... "The plot thickens!"
W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!
W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!
Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.
Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.
...Ouch. You're scary!
... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?
Yup, it clearly says "To Iris" on it.
H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!
Huh?
So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?
As they say... "The plot thickens!"
You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...
Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!
Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?
Well, we checked out her home and she's not there.
Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?
Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.
Umm, about this here...
I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?
Maybe we scared the poor kid away!
And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched!
Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?
Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...
... Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!
There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight.
...How did you know?
That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir?
This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this.
The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard!
......
That's it.
Just the victim's.
It sure is. It's called a "Shichishito" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.
Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of "all over the blade"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too.
Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant.
... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn.
Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good.
Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all.
Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.
Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir?
Ah! I just love skiing!
Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my "hard boiled" image.
...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth?
The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery.
The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon.
The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir.
Yeah, but there's one strange thing.
The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building.
Hey, you're right.Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in!
OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished. At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini
I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.
It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.
Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...
Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?
Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!
According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.
Nope, not a thing.
The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.
I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.
Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...
Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?
This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.
You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.
Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...
This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.
Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?
Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?
Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!
That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.
Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.
No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?
Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!
Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.
...He's just talking to himself.
Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!
I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, "Objection!". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!
I'm sorry!
This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.
You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.
Sounds pretty suspicious to me!
I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!
... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!
Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!
Really?
Really? I never would have expected that.
Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!
That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.
Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!
Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.
...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.
...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?
... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...
...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir.
Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...
...What now, pal?
I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!
"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed..." That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!
Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?
... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!
Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!
Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal!
Wh-What's wrong, sir?
Or maybe "viridian", in artist-speak.
How's your temperature now?
Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat!
You mean Iris, sir...?
Guess I should get moving, too.
Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side.
But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know.
No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off!
So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see!
The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know!
Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case.
Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah!
Y-You're...! Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah!
Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah!
P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir!
H-H-How did you know, pal!?
H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK?
... I... um... kinda already snuck in there!
Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden.
Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me?
Well, see you later!
Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here!
B-But...
Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it?
Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh!
Apparently, it belonged to the victim.
Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly.
Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently.
As recent as the night of the murder...
Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation.
Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK?
It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it?
Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch!
...
That's it. Gaaargh!
Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal?
Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood...
Y-Yes, sir!
We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place!
Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle.
Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir...
They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually.
Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet?
He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal.
He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here.
Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal.
Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning...
Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood.
We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal.
You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation!
Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down!
From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal.
However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now.
... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!?
Sorry, but that's not an option, pal.
I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal.
I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here.
Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge.
Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day.
Oh...
... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah!
... N-Not really.
She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery.
You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think.
I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right?
Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge!
That staff belonged to the victim.
Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK?
Well, no. But it's really...
Yes, sir.
It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that?
It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch.
That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side.
And there are traces of blood on it, too.
That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it.
Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault.
The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal.
What are you talking about!?
We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around.
Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal.
She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks.
I can't believe she's gone...
Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder.
She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying.
I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company.
Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat!
Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag!
... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir.
She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me.
Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time!
I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now.
He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard.
The guy drew a portrait of me, you know.
Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it.
... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...?
............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh!
............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh!
I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time!
I don't know. Probably to look cool.
There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure.
Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold.
Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head.

How long have you been there?
...Oh, OK.
I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon.
That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though...
I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ.
I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation.
... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal.
Mr. Godot.
Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter.
Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple.
What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look.
Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case.
Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal!
Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today.
In which case, it must've been another blade.
Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this!
You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK?
The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far?
So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector!
Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go?
I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try?
Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.
Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see!
... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream...
Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal.
She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery.
Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery!
That staff belonged to the victim.
Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK?
I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid.
...
Yeah, that's it.
It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal.
Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial.
Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal!
That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side.
There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal.
The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder.
She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying.
That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal.
I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company.
Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand.
Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat!
Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag!
She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me.
Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time!
I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now.
I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth.
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...?
Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her.
Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something...
Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser.
I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time!
I don't know. Probably to look cool.
There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure.
I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right?
She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it!
Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal?
She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case!
Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold.
Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head.
Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.
Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it!
So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right?
Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal. Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash. And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare. This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems
I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it.
... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank godness. Someone just dropped a spoon.
Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh?
I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind!
Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard.
Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy.
It says, "Bikini #1" on the side...
Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that!
That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now.
I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and...
Look, a ladder!
What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal.
I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. "That's a cabbage," he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing!
You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal!
H-How do you know that!?
That was my nickname in junior high.
I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me "Panhandler".
Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now.
Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been!
I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it.
Yeah, but now I found it again, pal.
Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore.
Must be because of the bell, I guess.
Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department.
... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective.
Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal!
Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces.
It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright!
That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal.
Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.
You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division.
Of course I do.I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...
Don't touch that, pal!
It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty.
Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once.
There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam!
Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood.
Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic.
It's weird that this thing is causing a racket...
Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the...
Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence.
Th-That's a...
Inside the staff...
...The murder weapon!?
Hey, pal! You've gotta watch the CHECK gauge and wait for it to flash, OK!?
They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot!
No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now.
... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh?
... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal!
OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ♪Every case is gonna be air tight... Every case is gonna be air tight...♪
Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know.
Huh? What are you talking about, pal!?
Maya? What's this got to do with her?
Oh? How so?
Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd--
You're... looking kinda viridian there...
OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished.
This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal.
... Don't worry... She'll be fine.
You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal?
I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal!
... I guess so.
Oh? What's that, pal?
... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal!
Oh, hey! So this is where you all were! Wow, looks like we've got quite the bunch here toda-- YEOWCH! Wh-What was that for, sir!?
Oh, you know. This and that. Anyway, congrats on your win! Let's go out tonight, pal! Dinner's on me! My salary's just sorta kinda gone down by a teeny-weeny bit, but it's alright! I made reservations at a first class French restaurant tonight! AAAAAAH!
Trés Bien, where else!?
Come on! Let's go, everyone! Can't keep Maggey waiting, pal! Hey! You! Crybaby! You're invited, too!
I'll bet she just went back home. Th-That's all!
Yeah, what is it, pal?
But... But what about you!?
Y-Yeah, but you're the... AAAAAAAAAAAH!
Maggey bought me a brand new coat as a present, pal! I feel 10 years younger! I'll never take it off!
Don't worry about it! In the name of love, a man will soil himself silly!

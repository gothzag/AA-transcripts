The police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!?
It's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright?
Um... My name isn't Gymshoe...
H-Hey, you! Don't touch anything!
Umm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright?
Hey, pal! No touching without my permission!
Hey, I can't be too careful if a kid like her can be a murder suspect, now can I?
I hate to break this to you, pal, but... with the way things look now, that girl's the only one who could've done it.
You can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence.
He was shot in the forehead. But...
But he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife.
After being stabbed, the final blow was a shot from a gun.
Ah, I'm really busy right now. I can take a look at it later, alright, pal?
Ahem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late...
Hey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet.
Oh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side.
Yeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid.
Ha ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest!
H-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol...
Oh, sorry...
I don't think you can win, pal. If you're talking about proof, we've got a few pieces.
Yeah, pal. That puffy-haired photographer's going to testify tomorrow.
...Besides, you must've realized by now, pal. There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it.
The victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year.
I was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it...
Hmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal?
I've got two pieces of news for you, pal.
Yeah. "Bad news" and "even worse news." So which do you want to hear first?
Alright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma.
That's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor...
Literally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a "prodigy," pal.
Oh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents.
Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge.
Hey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal.
Hey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit!
Yeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that.
...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you.
The nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic.
Hey, is that your house key or something, pal?
Then what's it for?
Oh. Nothing special, huh?
I'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal.
Look, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh*
Oh, so that's little Pearl.
Only that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this "weird guy" is, pal?
That's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good!
Boy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile!
Ooh, I'd better shut my mouth.
I'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal.
I don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal.
Not. A. Word.
H-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that!
Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!
Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.
Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.
*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.
I was about to get to that...
The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.
This is the victim's autopsy report, sir.
The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.
It was the victim's.
Along with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.
The shot was fired from point-blank range.
It was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.
Gunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!
But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.
A fruit knife.
It looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.
The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.
If it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.
The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.
Yup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.
I brought the two murder weapons with me today.
Y-Yes, sir!
Um... Y-Yes... sir...
Sorry, pal but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.
This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.
Sorry, pal but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.
Uh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal?
This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.
Yeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her.
As you can see, it's covered in blood.
Lab results show that it is the victim's blood.
Um, well...
What are you talking about, pal!?
Yeah, where, pal?
..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report.
G-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me!
Sorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.
Y-Yes, sir.
Um... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...
... Yes, sir.
The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.
We could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.
Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...
Yeah, I did.
Eh, um... What does it mean?
A-Ah! You're right!
Now that you...
Aaah!
Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!
Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!
During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.
Yes, sir.
During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.
Now that you mention it... Yeah, I guess...
Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.
But if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad.
Actually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack!
S-Sorry!
While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.
It looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day.
He got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder.
The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.
Sorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired.
The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun and ended it...
The victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger.
Eh? What do you mean?
G-Gunpowder... burn?
OH!
Fatal...?
Why are you showing this to me, pal?
...Do not contradict!
Haha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.
Come on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!
Who? Where? What?
...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...?
Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason.
Oof...
H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??
...P-Punishment...
O-Ow! H-Hey, hold on, OK, pal!? I'm not gonna hurt...
Aww, don't make that face. Hey, I'll tell you what! I'll show you something cool. Here, look! It's a real pistol...
Ah... Sorry...

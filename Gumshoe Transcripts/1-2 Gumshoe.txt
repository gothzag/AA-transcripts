Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?
We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.
Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!
This word "Maya" here mean anything to you?
WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name!
Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.
Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me "Dick"...
Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!
Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?
Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Oh that? I have that.
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Something the matter?
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.
Something the matter?
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
That what she said?
... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!
You all done, pal?
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!
Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!
You got that right, pal!
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!
Y-yes sir!
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
There were two people there already:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Yes sir!
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!
Y-yeah?
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...
Umm...
... Yes.
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
Y-Your Honor?
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Yeah, pal!
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
What! S-so it was you!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Of course I do, pal!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Y-yeah?
Oh? Oh hoh hoh.
Right! Where was I?
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
The right hand!
Hah hah hah! Nice try!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Oof!
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Th-that's right! What he said!
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?
B-backwards?
But...!
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Huh? I-I thought...
Urp!
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?
Urp!
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz!
Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right?
W-what!?

Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...
Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...
A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...
LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!
Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?
Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!
It's a report, pal. About you!
WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!
Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.
If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...
SO! What are you gonna do about it, pal!?
Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?
You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?
So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?
Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!?
Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal!
Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor...
Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again...
Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?
Yeah...
Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know.
...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened.
I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh!
Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!?
Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind.
Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer.
He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal.
Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy.
That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial.
Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK?
This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself.
The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony.
Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop.
The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table.
Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD...
But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD.
Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal.
Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie.
You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all.
It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected to the case anyway...
Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stiff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK?
Is that thing real, pal?
I wonder what this phony of yours is like...
I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was.
He started off by saying, "I'm at a complete loss for words..." But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour.
He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty!
What's that? A sports paper?
It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here.
"MC Bomber"... Hey!
I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, "MC Bomber"...
Ack, it's no good. I can't remember...
Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble.
Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue!
Hey! So how come she's not with you today?
Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know.
Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way!
She cross-examined me once, you know.
Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks.
I can't believe she's gone...
That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow.
He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal.
You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind.
I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything.
... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal.
Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words.
Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to.
The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? "Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins." And then he gave me this bottle.
I don't know. The label says, "Juniper". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day.
Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow!
Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant...
Hey, you're just in time!
The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.
They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.
The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.
"MC Bomber"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?
Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?
You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal?
So, how was it?
Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so...
The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt.
This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red.
Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble!
Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch.
So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim.
Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it.
You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh?
Huh? I don't get you...
A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis.
I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef.
I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is.
I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean...
It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills!
I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know?
He looks like one of those grouchy old man types.
It's OK, though. I don't mind guys like that. But, if he's involved with this case somehow, that's a different story.
Here's a tip for you, pal. If you wanna get information out of a guy like that... ...you're gonna have to find his weakness and try to get under his skin.
You're looking upbeat, as usual.
Yeah. That's life, huh? One guy's got it all, and one guy's got squat.
I-It is?
Gum, huh? This is gonna be a great year for this ol' Gumshoe then, right?
A-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?
Don't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?
And you!
You'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!
Yup.
O... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?
OK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?
...
Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.
Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday, sir!
Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.
Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.
Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.
Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.
Umm... Yes, sir...
When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.
When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.
Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?
Yeah, that's what she said. And I--
Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.
We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.
Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.
Huh? How should I know?
Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup.
Not sure I get you, pal.
If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.
The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.
Huh!? What do you mean?
Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--
Huh? For me?
Th... THAT piece... sir?
... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?
Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.
For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.
Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...
And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!
It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.
You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.
And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.
Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.
Huh? I don't get it.
*gulp*
She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.
It disappeared from the scene of the crime.
One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.
Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.
N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.
She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.
Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.
The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.
Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. "What took you so long!?" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...
Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.
The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.
I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful.
Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?
The victim didn't have any identification on him.
No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.
Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal!
But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.
Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?
Yeah, basically.
... Oh... That.
There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.
We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.
Yeah.
Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty.
Yeah. Completely empty.
When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.
Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal!
It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes!
Sorry...
And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?
Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?
Um, no. They didn't.
Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!
I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?
Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.
Now just call an "8", pal! Come on! I know you can!
Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an "8" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off!
Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal.
Aha ha ha... What can I say...?
This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!?
You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!?
S-Swiss cheese...?
So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean.
Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah!
Why!? Why is this happening!?
I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking.
Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate.
...
... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... "Bad"! That's it. It tasted bad!
It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal.
Huh?
Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited!
N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... "Daily Exercise Show"!
Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great!
But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal.
It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah!
Is that thing real, pal?
I wonder what this phony of yours is like...
It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising!
That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ...
I know I've heard that name somewhere before... "MC Bomber"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too...
Ack, it's no good. I can't remember...
I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please?
Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal?
Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me.
A one-way ticket to happiness, huh?
Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal.
...
That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too.
We never did find the contents of that bag.
Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Trés Bien. We're sure of that much.
Apparently everyone's listening to this show now.
They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling.
You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash!
Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all...
Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial.
Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh...
Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I...
I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right...
This guy was a real programming genius. They called him "the walking computer" at the place where he worked.
Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim.
F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well.
A computer firm called "Blue Screens, Inc." or something like that.
It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look.
I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more "detective-like" than I used to be.
...Like the color of my coat.
You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before.
Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw.
You know what that chef said to me? "Oh lá lá! Your body is full of la toxins." And then he gave me this bottle.
I don't know. The label says, "Juniper". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night.
That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something.
Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case.
I can't help you out if I don't have any info!
No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you...
Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something!
That's it! Come on, come on, come on!
Now just call an "8", pal! Come on! I know you can!
Noooooo! That's the wrong number!
D-Don't tell me you're not through yet...
I-It's... It's like you can see right through me!
That's why I said it was nothing!
I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try.
I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad!
I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg. When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping! You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!
Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30.
Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket.
Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit.
No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside...
Bye!
......
Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one!
Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me.
It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight.
You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal!
Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey.
Huh!? What are you doing here, pal?
You can't be here right now. You'll roped into the briefing if you stay.
We've got big problems here today.
It's a virus! A virus!!
There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system.
OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up!
No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear?
If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there!
Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts.
Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady.
I dunno.
Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal?
What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is?
Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on!
Damage? You mean it makes the machine go "boom" and explode?
Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh.
Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal?
Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold.
And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before.
We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met.
I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess.
Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival!
Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market.
Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal.
Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who!
Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola.
They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market.
Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one!
Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him.
I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight.
That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case.
What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now!
The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! "MC Bomber"!
Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber!
This guy was a real programming genius. They called him "the walking computer" at the place where he worked.
Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim.
That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it.
That should be the least of your worries, pal.
Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini.
Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family.
We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you?
Oh, this guy... The Tiger...
Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat!
Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive.
I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean.
I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal.
That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble.
I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean.
Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing!
You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!?
So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch?
Yeah? That's what she said? Really!?
Don't woory about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared.
I made a jumbo lunchbox!
Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this?
I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that!
Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK?
Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow.
Whoa! C-Come on, Gumshoe! Keep it together! You guys! Get outta here! Leave this guy to me.
Go, pal! And take this! If you get hurt, who'd look after Maggey, huh!?
Quit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!
I was watching through the doorway.
You look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.
Not in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?
This is the small bottle that turned up in Trés Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.
We finally got the analysis results back from the lab.
I'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.
Yeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.
Yeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!
Someone screw up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...
OK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?
The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
Hey, that's the pot calling the kettle black, little Ms. Topknot!
I-I can't stand still when I don't have a job to do! I-I-I kinda get wound up. Aaaaaaargh!
You gotta have something you need me to do, pal! Anything!
Hey, I'm gonna take a jog back down to the percinct. I could get some prints analyzed for you if you've got an hour!
You bet!
Oh, hey. That's that small bottle I gave back to you this morning, right?
Sure thing, pal! Actually, that's been gnawing at me, too!
That's that small bottle I gave back to you this morning, right?
You're right! Actually, that's been gnawing at me, too.
Oh, that. Sure, I'll see what I can do if I've got any spare time.
OK, I'll get this off to the lab right away. Just make sure you don't lose the case before I get back!
Waaaaaaaait!
Sorry I took so long, pal! I... I... I staked everything on this. My badge... The works! So here it is! My heart's counting on this, too!
Isn't it obvious, pal? It's the final, decisive piece of evidence!
Sorry it took so long, pal. But I finally got the results from the lab.
About the prints, pal! From this medicine bottle!
Do you think I'm some kind of hack detective? Of course I know!
Heh heh heh! You bet! Clear as crystal, all over the bottle! They're Furio Tigre's paw prints alright!
Huh!? What!? Why not?
...! ... I knew it. Great... No matter how hard I try... I'm never of any use.
This was our last chance to help Maggey. And I've been working on some useless piece of evidence the whole time! It's alright. I'm a real loser. It's not breaking news to me, pal.
... Sorry I let you down, Maggey. I know you didn't do it. And I'm a detective! We're supposed to be able to prove stuff like that! I'm really sorry! I'll get out of your hair now.
Oh. Guess I'll be heading off then. See you 'round, pal.
... ...
Oh, oh yeah. Congratulations, Maggey!
...
I-I knew you were innocent all along.
Huh? Oh... Well... I was... ... Well, guess I'll be heading off then. See you 'round.

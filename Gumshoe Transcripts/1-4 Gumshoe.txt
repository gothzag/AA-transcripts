Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?
Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!
Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do! I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!
Recruits... peh! ... Aah!
Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!
And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?
Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!
Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...
Huh? You don't know, pal?
Wow, okay, Mr. head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.
Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.
A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.
Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!
Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.
After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.
He hasn't got one yet.
Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.
Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.
Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!
Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.
Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai! Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case! He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright" over and over.
Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.
Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.
Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...
That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!
What? Find something!?
A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?
Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!
Erm... Probably not, pal.
Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.
W-what!?
Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.
Hey! Thanks for coming down, pal!
We just finished the meeting. For better or for worse...
No, no... Still can't I.D. him.
Not a word.
I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!
... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?
Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.
...
... Don't go telling anyone else, pal.
And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.
Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.
See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared "guilty" every time. Yeah, his methods right be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.
Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!
Oh, that? Yeah, I made a copy for you.
Well, I hope it helps you, pal.
Sorry, I'm drawing a blank right now.
What's going on here!?
This wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came "to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say"! What's this all about, pal!?
Why are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?
Er... You trying to say something about the way I do my job?
She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol.
She even had a photograph to prove it.
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"
In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.
Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation.
I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.
It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please! I know you're the only one who can do it, pal. You're the only one who can save Mr. Edgeworth!
Hey, pal, there's only one thing I want to see from you! And that's a letter of request from Mr. Edgeworth for you to be his defense attorney!
... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!
Good luck, pal.
Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!
Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!
Y-yessir!
Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.
A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
Er... yup.
We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
Er, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.
Our motto for the month is "get there quick."
Y-yessir! Sorry, sir!
So much to look forward to, these days...
Y-yessir!
That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Well... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.
Y-y-yessir!
Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.
You should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.
Mmph!
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.
A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.
So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.
Well, we found the murder weapon in the boat.
A pistol.
Right! S-sorry, Your Honor.
The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.
There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Y-y-yessir!
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.
She even had a photograph to prove it.
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"
Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...
Well, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess... I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?
It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!
S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
What's up?
... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.
Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.
Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.
He was really grateful for what she did, you know.
I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!
That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...
Oh, huh, really?
Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.
I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!
Then he's the one being shot, then!
... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?
Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.
Hmm...
Hey, making something of things is your job!
Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.
Now, she heard two gunshots, right?
What!? How's that possible!?
I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?
Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank.
I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.
Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.
Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?
Hey there, pal. What's up? You look out of sorts. Wait... you didn't go and do something that's going to hurt Mr. Edgeworth's case again!
Whatever, have a seat, pal. I'm here for you if you need anything. Besides money, that is.
It's not, really. We have another meeting coming up... We're supposed to talk about Mr. Edgeworth's motive...
See, Mr. Edgeworth's father died in the DL-6 Incident... And the guy who got the lone suspect declared innocent was the victim in this case... Robert Hammond. They're saying that's why Mr. Edgeworth shot him.
I gotta admit, it doesn't look good, pal.
The monster down in Gourd Lake? Not personally, no.
Huh!? Are you out of your minds!?
You got time to go wild monster hunting!? How about doing a little questioning for me then!?
... I see, pal. Sorry for shoutin' at you. ... Okay! I, Detective Gumshoe, will aid your search for Gourdy!
I'll loan you one of newest secret weapons for finding evidence!
You can take whichever one you like!
Hold on now, everything in due time. First, let me show 'em to you! These are our best and brightest! Introducing Secret Weapon No. 1: "Missile"!
He's a K-9 police dog, still in training! Missile! Missile! Here, boy...
Here he is.
Next, Secret Weapon No. 2... A fishing pole! Here, this is my own personal pole.
Yeah!
Never know 'til you try, pal!
Okay, this next one is the last one.
Secret Weapon No. 3! A metal detector! Here.
Right!
Hey, you never know! It might have been eating soda cans! Well, which will it be!?
Sure thing, pal. Be good to 'im!
Sure thing, pal. Oh, if it breaks, be sure to dispose of it properly, okay?
Sure thing, pal.
Remember: you're hunting for a monster. Anything is possible! Anything!
Hmm? Yeah, sure, pal! But I have to take back the last one I lent you, department policy. Well, take your pick. Which will it be?
Sure thing, pal. Be good to 'im!
Sure thing, pal. Oh, if it breaks, be sure to dispose of it properly, okay?
Sure thing, pal.
Remember: you're hunting for a monster. Anything is possible! Anything!
Missile is a big star in criminal affairs.
Huh... now that you mention it, I'm not sure. But I hear he's aptly-named, for what it's worth.
It's funny, one day I woke up and I wanted a fishing pole.
I've never gone. I just wanted one so bad, I went out and bought it. I've never used it, actually.
As you can see, it's a metal detector. We use it to look for bullets in the ground. If you can find that monster with it, all the better!
Hey, pal! Long time no see! ... You don't look so happy. What's wrong this time?
Yeah?
Oh, yeah...
Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.
... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.
Hmm...
H-huh?
...!
... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal.
However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.
R-really?
Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you.
What's that? A parrot?
That incident?
Wh-what!?
Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?
...
... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.
Hey, pal! Long time no see!
Close one today, eh! I got so worked up, I snapped my tie in half!
No prob, pal! Thanks to you, we now know who really did it!
Look, I'll make you a promise. I'll have that scoundrel in my custody by trial time tomorrow! Come what may! It's my duty to you as a police officer! Now, I'm off to catch me a criminal!
Oh, one other thing!
No one can go into the woods today.
The woods are off-limits to camping, and apparently the park ranger found out. He got pretty mad. No one can go in for a while.
Anyway, I'll be seeing you tomorrow!
What's gotten into that girl?
Morning! Mr. Edgeworth?
Have no fear! As promised, I've captured our runaway caretaker! I just brought him in. Took all night, pal.
Actually, after that shock I got on the way in, I feel pretty good.
... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal! I mean, you... kill your dad?
This is crazy! Just crazy!
...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!
Whoooooooooooooop! Amazing, pal! You pulled through just like I thought you would! I'll never forget this! I owe you one, pal. And tonight, let's party! Dinner's on me! Yeah, my salary went down again a bit this month... But who cares!
Harry Butz! You come along tonight too! My treat, pal!
And after that, dinner on me!
Hey, pal! Mr. Edgeworth came down to the precinct to wish me a happy new year! Talk about a pleasant surprise!
Then he hung his head low and went right back outside. Kind of like he was embarrassed or something. Strange, huh?

If you don't mind, sir... I'd really love to talk with you.
About the incident...
And... was the customer alone?
And?
Oh, how terrifying!
Do you like the food at Trés Bien?
Really? How interesting!
What a lovely story.
Ha ha ha!
You visit Trés Bien a lot, don't you?
Really? Oh, you're so flattering! The owner would be delighted to welcome you, I'm sure.
Whatever did Mr. Armstrong do!?
Are you sure about this?
OK, Phoenix. That's about as much as I can do to help.
Honestly! I can't believe Maya called me for something like this!

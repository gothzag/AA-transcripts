Sorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble.
I'd say so.
The boy, of course.
I'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix.
My poor plant! It looks so... so sluggish! Have you been watering it properly, Phoenix?
That child! Sorry, Charley.
That movie...? Oh! I'd sure like to see that one again! It's, um... What was it, again? S-sorry, it's right on the tip of my tongue...
We need to get to the studio and talk to that boy.
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Showing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, "Dead men don't tell tales."
Oh well. Let's try again another day, Phoenix.
My, what a violent old lady...
Phoenix! That "hostage" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that!
Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her?
Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?
It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.
Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.
This is one of Maya's favorite movies.
That... would be kind of sad.
... Phoenix... Was that the boy?
I think he ran into the dressing room.
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.
Look at this! "Spaghetti in a Soda Can"...?
"Best when slammed." I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?
Come back! ... There. He's back.
Hey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please?
Hello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you.
Phoenix, you can take it from here.
Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.
Sorry? What was that about Maya?
Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid.
Same as always.
Phoenix! Can't you see she's desperate?
Phoenix, do something! She's blacking out!
Doesn't doing good things like that make you feel great?
Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow.
Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?
Really? Are you sure?
Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.
?
Cody.
Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? "For great justice"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.
What is it, Cody?
Yes?
True enough.
Indeed.
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.
... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.
Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!
Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?
... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.
Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?
Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.
See you soon.
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!
Phoenix.
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!
Well, Phoenix?
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!
...
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!
Cody? Answer his question, okay?
Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.
...
Phoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.
Phoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!
Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!
There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!
Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!
Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.
W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!
Wait, Phoenix!
Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!
Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!
Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!
We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.
Me too!
Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.

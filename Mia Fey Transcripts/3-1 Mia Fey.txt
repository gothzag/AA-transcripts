(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)
Oh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!
What are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!
I, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...
Umm, actually this is my second time in court...
I just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.
Well about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.
Good morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)
Oh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?
Right, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!
(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)
My name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'll win. For my client... And for myself.
The defense is ready, Your Honor!
Y-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?
Yes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...
Yes, well...
(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.
...!
(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)
An unusual death...!?
Huh...!?
Um, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)
I-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.
(Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...)
Y-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...)
Well... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation.
Well it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe.
I-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...)
Err... Hypothermia, I believe.
Umm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you?
I-I'm so sorry...
(Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...)
According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.
Wh-What's that?
Wh-What do you mean...?
(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)
Ev-Evidence...?
Y-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!


Oh no... I'm so sorry...
Y-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)
The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.
(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.
Whew... It looks like the judge understands.
Huh...?
And that would be...?
Cross-examination...?
Contradictions...?
But... Mr. Wright is my client!
(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)
(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)

When you say "there", you mean the place where the victim was murdered?
A-Anyway, Mr. Wright... What were you doing at the scene of the crime? I thought you said you didn't know the victim, Mr. Swallow.

You say you found the body? So who called the police?
(Could you stop sneezing every time you're in a bind...?)

So, you didn't know his face, or even his name, right?
So... Which is it? Did you know him or not?
(N-News to me! Why didn't he tell me that before...?)

Mr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: "I hardly knew the guy to begin with..."
But that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a "stuck-up British wannabe"!?
...
Well, Mr. Wright!?

Did you see it at the crime scene? The Union Jack, I mean.
(He's acting fishier than the salmon I ate last night...)
Y-Yes, Your Honor. (What is it now?)
...
(Hey, something just occurred to me... Isn't there something strange about this bit just now?)
M-Mr. Grossberg!
(OK, Mia, check the Court Record carefully!)

(One year ago... I was in a courtroom just like this. I can do it. I can handle this myself!)
I-I'll be fine! I know what I have to do!
Umm, Mr. Grossberg... I could use a little help...
I present the piece of evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony...?
But still... I don't see any contradictions in Mr. Wright's testimony!
Information...?
Even if they're my own client?
(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)
Are you certain you saw the "Union Jack"?
Your Honor, please take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, there's absolutely nothing written on the victim's back.
I was under the impression that you accidentally came across the body. But, if that was really the case, then you wouldn't know that, would you? You'd have no idea at all what he was wearing underneath that jacket! Mr. Wright... You've been lying to me!
Let him! That "P" on his chest doesn't stand for Phoenix anyways! I can't believe I trusted him! Mr. Wright was all wrong!
...!
(Uh oh... Did I go too far?)
(He lost it? Does this even have anything to do with the case...?)

Y-Yes, but even I've got a bottle of Coldkiller X in my apartment!
Wh-What!?
(This is really bad...)
(Oh please, Mr. Wright... Don't tell any more lies.)

Had you ever met the victim before then?
Oh! I'm so sorry! I just felt like slapping something all of a sudden!

Was it Mr. Swallow who indicated you should meet at 2:45?
(What do I do!? Maybe I should ask him for some more details?)
So you are absolutely certain that you met at 2:45?
Experiments...?
(Well, it looks like he's right about the time anyway.)
I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the Pharmacology Department.
A little bit earlier in your testimony, you said something interesting. You said the department uses strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.
"High-voltage cables"...
(Finally I think we're getting somewhere...!)
(I've gotten everything I need from this statement. It's time to move on.)

So what was it you were talking about?
("Hang out again sometime"? I wish that were true.)

So you say you went back...
Yes, but why did you go back in the first place? Weren't you angry with him?
Then why, Mr. Wright? Why did you go back there?
...
(Judging by the atmosphere... I'm pretty sure no one is buying this.)

It's rather unusual to catch a cold this time of the year, isn't it?
(I suppose common sense is not always common...) So... Did anyone else know that you were taking cold medicine?

On the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...?
You can never be too sure...
Oh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!
I don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.
I know... But what can I do!?
Hmph...!
(So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)
(Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.)
Mr. Grossberg!
(Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...)
Your Honor!
I believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.
Hmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)


(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)
As for the cause of death... ...I'd say this picture captures it quite well!


Well naturally... it's right around here! ...I think.
(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)
Well, naturally... it's right here!
A severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!
Yes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!
Don't toy with me, old man!
Ah! Y-You mean...?
M-Mr. Grossberg!
N-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.
Y-Your Honor...!

Is this what you want, Mr. Wright!?
You still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!
It's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.
No matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.
Mr. Wright...
Oh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)
(That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)
Y-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)

So what kinds of things did Mr. Swallow say to you?
...
(Oh boy! You're not doing yourself any favors here, Mr. Wright! Please don't make this harder for me than it already is!)

Can you tell me about what happened in a little more detail?
And when you did that, there was no severed cable anywhere to be seen?
(What are you doing!? Don't let that guy steamroll over you like cheap asphalt!)

A "loud noise"? And what would you say that loud noise was, Mr. Wright?

Y-You're not qualified to decide that! (What should I do? I'm treading on some dangerous ground here...)
(I've got other, more pressing things to ask about.) Very well, Mr. Wright, let's move on, shall we?
Mr. Wright, that "loud noise" you heard may be extremely important. So try to remember what it was!
Yes? Could it have been? Hurry up and tell us!
Umm, well...
Of course it's not important!
Well, it just isn't! It's not important one bit! Not even one iota. OK?
(This is it, Mia! The new information you've been waiting for!) Of course it's important! No! This cheap umbrella is more than important; it's vital! I want to officially have it entered into the testimony!

So Mr. Swallow fell on top of his umbrella? And you are certain of this?
The umbrella, you mean?
Ah! I-I'm so sorry!


After you shoved the victim, did you leave the scene right away?

At that time, did you see anyone else at the scene of the crime?
(Geez. Could that stupid cough possibly sound any phonier?)
Y-Yes, sir! (Right now I need more info; info that will help me turn up some contradictions!)
Why didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?
I would've been able to counter the prosecution's arguments earlier!
Take another look at the crime scene photo! According to Mr. Wright, the victim fell on top of his umbrella. However, if you look closely... ...the umbrella is nowhere near the victim. Actually, it's by the electrical pole!
The conclusion here is obvious. After the defendant left, the victim moved from where he fell. In other words... After he was pushed by the defendant, Mr. Swallow was still alive!

According to the testimony, the victim fell on top of the umbrella. There's simply no way it could have been blown there by the wind!
... Let me guess. You have another witness.
... "Bad news"? You couldn't be more wrong. Actually... I've been waiting for this.
It's alright. At least you told us the truth in the end, Mr. Wright.
Why do you think that?
The love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?
...!
It certainly is a little bottle alright.
Um, anyway... So after that, you and Ms. Hawthorne started dating?
By the way, Mr. Wright. The day you first met Dahlia Hawthorne, eight months ago... It wouldn't happen to have been on August 27th, would it?
This happened on August 27th, right here in this courthouse.
I hope you don't mind, Mr. Grossberg... I... I need to finish this myself.
Th-Thank you!
(I guess so... That recess sure seemed longer than 20 minutes though...)
(Wh-What's with this stiff silence...?)
(I can't believe he actually said that!)
(I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)
If we may move on now... What is your full name and occupation?
(Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...)
(She's going to be a tough witness, alright... It only took her 12 seconds to wrap them all around her little finger.)

That's more than enough, witness. I won't allow this to continue.
Please, just let me proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honor. I, for one, don't plan to win my case on a bunch of paper-thin lies!
...
Yes. We've met before... Once.
"Madame"!? (I'm no one's grandma yet, girlie!)

Now, unless I'm mistaken, Feenie -- I mean, Mr. Wright is in the Art Department. If that's the case, then what were you doing by the Pharmacology building?
(That's supposed to be poetry? Sounds more like a mid-life crisis!)
(How else would you enter? Teleportation!?)

So who is this "Dougie" person?
So what were Dougie-- *ahem* Mr. Swallow and Mr. Wright talking about anyway?
(Why am I being demonized here?)

Are you saying that the victim just collapsed on his own?
In other words, the defendant never touched the victim. Is that right?
(If I press her for no good reason, I just know the judge will get angry with me... Hmm, so what should I do about her testimony just now?)
(Hmm... I suppose her statement works in our favor, for now. I'll hold off on looking into it any deeper until it's necessary.)
Feeble lies are not very becoming, Ms. Hawthorne, so let's drop them, shall we?
...
...
...
Now then, Ms. Hawthorne. The defendant's palmprint was found on Mr. Swallow's leather jacket. It has already been shown that Mr. Wright did, in fact, push the victim.
There's no need to try to cover for the defendant. It would be much better if you came out and told us the whole truth.
(Looks like we're finally getting somewhere...)

And what did Mr. Wright say when he saw you?
You don't remember...?
(Please... Someone, anyone... Stop him before he gets hurt... by me.)

You didn't see it!?

So then, what did it look like they were doing to you?
(Oh, give me a break!)


When you say "students" do you mean students from the Pharmacology Department?
Please try to stay on topic! So to find some Pharmacology students, you went to the labs, correct?
(The students knew what was going on...?)
(The Pharmacology students... They have nothing to do with the incident. I think what I need is more information about Dahlia herself.)
But how could the students have known what was going on?
(Hmm... It doesn't look like I'm going to get any more info about the students.)
(That girl... She's telling a super obvious lie, and she knows it. She's just pretending to protect Mr. Wright... Yes, that's got to be it! Way to go, Mia! OK, that means I'm going to have to dig deep to find the contradiction on this one!)
You say you didn't hear any noise. Is that correct?
That's nice, but I find that just a little odd. I have here, the testimony of your boyfriend, Mr. Phoenix Wright. And he clearly testified to the effect... ...that when he pushed the victim, he heard a sharp, loud noise.
If you were really that close to the two of them, why didn't you hear this noise as well?

But according to Mr. Wright's testimony, it was a sharp noise like a "SNAP"! There's no way a noise like that could fail to make an impression!
Thunder and lightning, huh...
(Wait a sec, Mia! That testimony just now... She said something that could totally change this whole case!)
Your Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!
It's obvious. The problem is that the witness claims to have not heard the "SNAP!"
(I'm not THAT bad! ...I think.)
(This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?)
Your Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!
It's obvious. The problem is that she claims to have been listening to music!
(Yikes! I'm in trouble now!)
(This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?)
Your Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!
Didn't you notice? She said there was lightning, correct?
Well, lightning is actually a large discharge of electricity in the atmosphere, am I right?
Yes, Your Honor. Anyway, since the cause of death was electrocution... ...isn't it possible that the victim died from being hit by a bolt of lightning!?
(Just what kind of thoughts DO occur to this guy anyway?) This entire case is built on the premise that Mr. Doug Swallow was "murdered"... ...but that very premise itself is mistaken! The defense believes that Mr. Swallow was, in fact, the victim of a stray bolt!
(Alright, you did it, Mia! I'll be taking that "Not Guilty" now if you don't--)
Huh...?
Whaaa!?
So you're saying the equipment lost power because...
Y-Your Honor... (I don't like how this is looking one bit! I have to come up with something to try to regain some momentum!) If it pleases the court, the defense would like to state its opinion.


This is it! This is why the cable snapped.
Nnnfff...! (Ouch, that was harsh...) Please, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Your Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.
He said that after he pushed the victim, he heard a loud, sharp noise. Now, this happened at around 3:00 PM, correct?
The lab equipment lost power at 2:55 PM... which fits right in Mr. Wright's timeline. In other words, it was Mr. Wright's shove that caused the power outage.

I'm afraid I can't agree with you there, Mr. Payne.
Take a good look at where the victim landed after being shoved. See the umbrella? It's by the electrical pole. That's right. The victim banged into that pole as a result of being pushed. It was that impact that caused the cable to break.
I'm sorry Your Honor, but no. It doesn't make sense at all. If the victim was shoved into the far pole... ...then he couldn't have been electrocuted by this severed cable in the foreground here!
In other words... Someone other than my client must have electrocuted the victim!
(Ah, the lamentations of my enemy. How I've longed to hear them!)
What the...!?
(This is it... She's finally starting to show her true colors!)

Ms. Hawthorne... Previously in your testimony you said the following... "Actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie."
So that's why you basically lied to the court?
Of course he won't! What you did is called "perjury"...
(The judge had better be more careful himself! A dark alley is friendlier than that girl!)

You're saying you actually saw the victim get pushed into the electrical pole?
(Oh, really...?)

So let me get this straight. You were happily listening to music on your headphones while you watched this scene unfold?
Ch-Cheer them on? What do you mean by that?

That doesn't sound quite right... There were handprints found on the chest of the victim's leather jacket. Mr. Payne, were there also prints found on the back of his leather jacket?
...!?
Unngghh...

Did you actually witness the moment the victim was electrocuted?

(If I don't figure out the contradiction here... ...it's all over! She didn't have much time to come up with her lie, so this is my best chance. There must be a hole in her testimony somewhere! Think, Mia!)
That's enough, witness.
You will in a minute. Could you please take a look at this picture?
It's not the medicine I want you to look at... It's the wristwatch. It stopped at the precise time the victim was electrocuted. In other words... 3:05 PM.
My point is this! What time was it when the lab suffered that power outage due to the cable snapping?
Would you care to explain to the court, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne... ...what exactly happened during this 10 minute interval!?
The defense proposes that... ...it was during this interval that the real murderer killed Mr. Doug Swallow!

Even you can't deny that the time between the cable breaking and the electrocution... ...are completely unaccounted for!
There's only one person who could have murdered Mr. Swallow. Only after my client had left the scene... ...was there a window of opportunity for the real killer!
(It's finally time. This is the moment I've been waiting for.) Yes, Your Honor. We are ready.


Err... Umm... A bout of youthful indiscretion! ...Your Honor!
(Unngggh... No way! I won't let it end like this!)
It could only have been you, Dahlia Hawthorne!
Ten minutes passed between the time the cable broke and the time of the electrocution! What exactly were you doing that whole time, Ms. Hawthorne? Were you really listening to some music while "cheering them both on" as they fought? I find it hard to believe that you didn't lift a finger to stop the men "dearest" to you!
Ms. Hawthorne! I believe you did witness the two men fighting on that day. However! After Mr. Wright pushed the victim, and subsequently left the scene... ...it was YOU who pushed Mr. Swallow to his death by your very own hands!
What the...!? Are you daft!?
Oh...! Mr. Grossberg! You're back!
Thank you so much! This is exactly what I was hoping for!
Yes. I am. Not only am I saying you murdered Doug Swallow... ...but you also tried to pin the whole thing on your current lover, Phoenix Wright!
(The answer to that lies somewhere in this police report. It must!)
Eight months ago, an incident occurred in the basement cafeteria of this building. And then... that same day the two of them "accidentally" meet...
Your Honor. The defense requests further testimony from Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne!
About the events of the day when she first met the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright.

The witness claims that she has no reason to frame the defendant, am I correct? Well I have evidence that suggests that she, in fact, had a very good reason!
(Get ready for the battle of your life, Dahlia Hawthorne!)
(And now we enter the final act of our little drama!)

So until that time, you had been dating Doug Swallow?
(Maybe you should look for a different line of work...)

The courthouse reading room? That's a strange place to meet the love of your life.
I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you, Ms. Hawthorne. What was a literature student like you doing in a courthouse reading room?
(I have to remember the judge is on Dahlia's side. I'd better tread carefully...)
(Mia, if the judge gets any angrier, you'll lose the whole case! I'll just have to hold my tongue for the time being.)
Your Honor, if you'll allow me some latitude, I think I can establish relevance. Please ask her to continue on with her testimony!

You were writing a paper? On what?
(Again with the mid-life crisis stuff!?)


Hmm... So what was it about Mr. Wright that made your heart malfunction like that? In my personal opinion, he just looks like a typical snotty-nosed college brat.
Perhaps to you, Ms. Hawthorne. But to the rest of the planet, he's a dime a dozen.

Were there any bad feelings between you and Mr. Swallow?
But that can't be!
Huh... Are you... Are you sure?
(So the victim wanted to break up with her...?)
So you're saying that Mr. Swallow also wanted to break up with you?
(She didn't deny it... That must mean... Doug Swallow must have seen through her little act. He must have gotten a glimpse of her true nature.)
(What did the victim think of Dahlia Hawthorne...? Well, I guess I don't have to think about that now...)
Ms. Hawthorne, you weren't here because of your research paper, were you? Didn't you actually come here for a much more important reason?
Eight months ago, right here in this very courthouse, there was another tragedy.
The name of the suspect in that incident is listed here in this report. And that name is... Dahlia Hawthorne!
Yes! The sweetie-pie of everyone's eye, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne! She was the prime suspect in a criminal case just eight months ago!
(OK... I've tied the two crimes together! Now I've just got to stay on the offensive!)
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Payne. But I'm afraid the defense has many more tricks up its sleeve today. And I'll be sure to show them to you before the end of this cross-examination!

What were you talking about with the defense attorney?
Why don't you tell us all what that incident was?
You get involved in a lot of "incidents", don't you, Ms. Hawthorne?
(*gag* Those two really are making me ill. Albeit for decidedly different reasons.)

How long were you gone?
And where were you during that stretch of time? Using the toilet?

About how much liquid is 2 teaspoons?
(So it's about two-thirds of that amount, huh...)

A "special kind of poison"? How so?
(The better question is, how did the criminal get something like that?)

And that's the reason they didn't arrest you? Because no one could show how you could've gotten the poison?

Then all we have to do is find a way to establish how she could've gotten some, right? (Great... Now just how did a lit. student get a hold of poison, of all things...?)
You wouldn't know how to get that kind of poison? I don't believe you.
In fact, you had easy access to that kind of poison, didn't you? At your boyfriend's lab!
That's right. Up until eight months ago, Ms. Hawthorne was dating Mr. Swallow. And if you'll recall, Mr. Swallow was a Pharmacology student at Ivy University.
His laboratory contained highly advanced chemistry equipment. In fact, without such equipment... ...the culprit could never have obtained such a rare and special poison!
Well, Ms. Hawthorne? It seems you had access to such a poison after all. And then, it was a matter of slipping it into the victim's coffee when he wasn't looking. The only person who could've done that was the one sitting at his very table -- you!
What is it, Ms. Hawthorne?
(She's right... They even mentioned that in the report!) W-Well, you could've easily gotten rid of something that small!
P-Proof...!? (She got me good with that!)
(The police conducted a full body search of Dahlia and of the entire courthouse. And yet the container holding the poison disappeared right after the crime occurred...)


(Ohhh...! Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry!)
You were forced to get rid of the container in a hurry, weren't you? And that's why you passed it on to someone that had nothing to do with the case! Someone that you knew wouldn't be searched!
Mr. Phoenix Wright, of course.
Of course not. She gave the poison to him disguised as... a present.
The day that the witness met and fell for Mr. Phoenix Wright was eight months ago... August 27th. The very same day as the poisoning incident. Under the pretense of love, the witness gave my client a present. All for the purpose of hiding the one piece of evidence that would give her away!
No, there's no longer any poison in that bottle. However! I'm certain if the crime lab were to analyze it, they would find a trace amount!
Mr. Wright... Why? Why are you going through so much trouble to protect her?
Mr. Wright... Have you ever thought about this... Why exactly would a woman like Dahlia Hawthorne want to date you anyway?
(Mr. Wright... Please! Open your eyes...!) At this point in the trial, I think it should be obvious to everyone. The real reason that Dahlia Hawthorne is dating you is...
Naturally it's because she has fallen madly in love with you too!
I-I'm sorry! I don't know why I even said that... *sigh* I guess it's because I just like the sound of that phrase, "madly in love"...
Please let me think it over one more time, Your Honor...
Naturally, it's to keep you quiet!
Well... uh...
(ARGH!! How dense can you be!?)
Yes, Your Honor...
Dahlia Hawthorne was not and is not madly in love with you. The only think she's after is that bottle necklace you love to wear around your neck!
Back there in the waiting room, you said it yourself...
For Dahlia Hawthorne, that necklace is irrefutable evidence of her crime. That's why she absolutely had to get it back.
But you never gave it back to her. And to make things worse for her, you insisted on showing it to everyone you met. That's why she......
Eeeeeek!!
Y-Yes, I-I think so...
Where... Where's Mr. Wright?
Thank goodness... ... Oh no!
The bottle necklace...! Ms. Hawthorne's "present"...! It's gone...!
Mr. Wright must have grabbed it when he slammed into me!
Mr. Wright! What did you do with the bottle necklace?
It's OK. Just give back the necklace.
... You what?
What the...?

Y-Your Honor!! You've got to stop the trial!! Mr. Wright! Mr. Wright! Are you feeling OK!? Does your stomach hurt!? That bottle you swallowed may have had some poison left in it!
H-How can you be so sure!?

No! There must be some mistake! The bottle must not have had any poison left in it! Either that or the poison must have lost its potency...
B-But why!?
Unngggh! (Even though I've proven so much, is she going to get away with everything...?)
M... Mr. Wright!
Mr. Wright... What are you trying to say?
Is it true? Did he really say that?
What!?
(So Dahlia stole poison eight months ago too, huh... If you put that together with Mr. Wright's testimony... ...then there's only one possible conclusion!) The defense believes that Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne... ...stole some poison on the night before she killed Doug Swallow.
Naturally, her motive for stealing it was to kill someone!
(Mia, this is your last chance. Think carefully now... There's something that she desperately wanted to get back... Therefore...)


Because Doug Swallow had figured out what kind of a person she was! And so...
Y-Yes, Your Honor! (I can't mess up again!)

W-Well it's been a long time since I've been in court...
I apologize, Your Honor... (No more mistakes, Mia!)
There was one person that was standing squarely in Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne's way... And that person was... Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Well, it's true that that's how things worked out... But, let's remember that Mr. Swallow died of electrocution, not poison. The person that Ms. Hawthorne was planning to poison was in fact... You, Phoenix Wright. There's no one else that it could be.
(Poor Mr. Wright... This must be killing him... Hang in there... I'll bring her to justice... I swear it!) As I said before, the only thing Ms. Hawthorne truly cared about was... ...the one piece of evidence linking her to that incident eight months ago. That's right. The bottle necklace. That's all she cared about.
Eight months ago, just after the fall of that attorney in the basement cafeteria... Dahlia Hawthorne could think of only one thing. How to get rid of the bottle necklace as quickly as possible!
It was a pretty good move she made, too. The evidence was missing for a long time. But there was just one big problem. Although she got him to hide the evidence, Mr. Wright refused to return it to her. To him, the tiny little bottle was a cherished treasure. He even showed it to everyone he met!
Correct, Your Honor. It was to retrieve that piece of evidence.
It appears that this trial will be coming to an end soon...
You ARE a criminal, Ms. Hawthorne!
Urk...! W-Well, umm...

(I can't let her get away this time!)
The ultimate price...?
N-No...!
(If I mess up here, my career as a lawyer is over! But to be honest... at this point I don't have any evidence that's well-founded. Even so... I'd rather lose my attorney's badge than let her get away with murder!) Your Honor! The defense would like to present proof!
J-Just one!?
I understand, Your Honor.
(She was planning to poison Mr. Wright... If that's the case, then the poison was probably in there!)


Please wait, Your Honor! I just... made a mistake!
Here it is, Your Honor! The evidence that will prove her guilt once and for all.
If I did, I still wouldn't take this cold medicine. After all... It's been poisoned.
Remember what the defendant said in his testimony.
She was the one who took his bottle of Coldkiller X. Then she poisoned it, knowing that Mr. Wright was going to take some.
I would like the court to recall the crime that happened here eight months ago. Where did Ms. Hawthorne hide the evidence?
Eight months ago, the poison was hidden in her bottle necklace... ...which she then gave to someone else for safekeeping. Someone she had accidentally run into in the reading room. My client, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Yes, that's right... She did the same thing this time as well. After shoving the victim, Mr. Phoenix Wright left the scene of the crime. That is when the murderer, Dahlia Hawthorne, appeared. With her, she was carrying the poisoned bottle of Coldkiller X. This, of course, was so she
Yes, and she heard and saw everything that happened at the scene of the crime. Including what the defendant and victim were arguing about, and the cut electrical cable.
She used the severed electrical cable to silence him forever. Unfortunately for her, this is when the problem occurred. Mr. Wright, who she thought had left the scene, came back to check on the victim. And on top of that, because of the power outage, some students showed up as well. It's hardly any wonder that she was, as she put it, in a state of panic. Recall that she was carrying that bottle of poisoned cold medicine. She must have thought, "What if they search me like they did eight months
Yes, she disposed of the evidence exactly the same way as she did back then! She had someone else hold it! In this case... Doug Swallow!

Hmm... I wonder which one of us is the desperate one? So, Ms. Hawthorne. This cold medicine... I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking some?
Well, Mr. Wright ate that necklace of yours, right? Now it's your turn to prove your innocence. What do you say?
If I'm just a filthy, stinking liar, then there's no need to worry. So come on! Show us! I dare you to take some of this medicine right now!
...!
"For the time being"?
...?
(Whew... It's finally all over.)
Well then, Mr. Payne, let me ask you this.
Would you care to try this cold medicine?
Just a little earlier, I could've sworn you said...
So, if she's so trustworthy... ...then I'm sure there couldn't possibly be any poison in here, right?

...And here comes the backpedal! Come on now, "Rookie Killer"! Show this rookie how it's done! How much trust do you really have for this woman? Are you willing to bet your life!?
(Don't lie! Just admit you were wrong!)
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
... Your Honor... How we knew each other had nothing to do with this case.
Thank you for everything, Mr. Grossberg.
Umm, Mr. Grossberg... Do you, um, maybe think you could stop talking about them?
Oh! Mr. Wright...! Congratulations!
Go on...
Um, what?
(Boy... This poor kid still hasn't got a clue...) You need to forget about her, Mr. Wright. For your own sake...
Also... You need to relax a bit more. Try to grow up a little.
(Eek! What kind of company must this guy keep!?)
That's what you keep saying... But I thought you were in the Art Department?
I see.
Mr. Wright, I'm still new at this myself. But... I think that's exactly what a lawyer is.
Phoenix, no matter what, always believe in your client. In a court of law, your greatest weapon is your belief.

Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!?
... Actually... I don't either.
(Looks like you missed the mark on that one, Mia!)

Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Actually... I don't quite get it either.
(Aghh... He's mad at me now. But you can't give up yet, Mia!)

Does this evidence establish that the defendant is lying?
Oops, sorry. This is all still kind of new to me...
(This isn't going as smoothly as I had hoped...)

The witness's testimony just now is clearly contradictory, Your Honor!
It has to be, right!? I knew it!
Um...
(Well, there goes a few points with the judge...)

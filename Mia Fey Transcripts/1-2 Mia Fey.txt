Hey Maya, it's me.
Sorry, I've been so busy. How you been?
That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.
Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.
It's... a clock.
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.
Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.
Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.
Yep. I'll be waiting, Maya.
I'm sorry, but I can't give you what I don't have.
How could you know...?
I... I should have been more careful.
!!!
"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]

"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."
Never give up, Phoenix!
Ah, you're finally awake.
H-hey! Phoenix! ... "Gak"? That's no way to greet an old friend! Phoenix, I want you to look at me.
Didn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.
That's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you.
We don't have much time, Phoenix. Now listen. You've already won.
You have that Receipt in the court record, right?
Phoenix! White wrote that, not me!
Look at the front of the receipt!
That's right, Phoenix. I bought that stand the day before I was killed!
Now, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?
There you go! I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!
The witness will stay!
Phoenix! Read this note out loud.
Mr. White. Admit your guilt, right here, right now. Or else this list will be released to the press!
Case closed, Your Honor.
Well, I never thought I'd be saying this again... But, congratulations! You're lucky I was born a Fey!
I'm glad you made it. ... Thank you, Phoenix. You risked a lot to help me... and Maya. I won't forget it as long as I live!
... My time here's running out.
Maya's powers are still weak. I can't stay here that long.
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll meet again.
Hee hee. I'm not the "Chief" anymore. Phoenix? Can you come to the office tonight... say, 9:00?
I'll see you later.
(Good luck, Phoenix. I'll always be here... watching.)

Wright!
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?
Well, that's news to me!
... Isn't that your client screaming over there?
It sounds like he wants to die...
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Wright! Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client! I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just touch the Court Record button to check it at anytime, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you are in a pinch.
Wright? If you forget something, just touch the Court Record button to help you remember. A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Touch the Court Record button to check the Court Record frequently.
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!
Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious. Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to him!
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!
Wright! You know what to do!
Wright! I can't put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy. Something about "hearing" the television...
Wright! I think the problem lies someplace else...
Notice anything suspicious?
Now, find the contradiction!
Wright! Are you out of your mind!? That clock doesn't look like a clock at all! The witness couldn't have possibly known it was a clock just by seeing it! He said himself, he never entered the apartment! It was in his testimony!
Not so fast, Mr. Sahwit!
Listen up, Wright! Don't throw this one away, not like this! Think!
Um... well, yes. But that doesn't mean you can't still win! Try thinking out of the box! Don't waste time doubting the facts. Assume the clock was three hours slow and... Think through it! Ask yourself, "Why was the clock three hours slow"? Figure out the reason, and you'll have your proof! Right, Wright? Can you think of a reason as to why the clock would be three hours slow?
You must have evidence somewhere that can prove it, Wright! Find it and let them have it!
I know you can figure it out! There must be some evidence in the Court Record... Something that can show why that clock was three hours slow! Find it, and he won't have a foot to stand on!
Wright! Good job in there! Congratulations!
Not at all, not at all! You fought your own battles in there. It's been a while since I've seen a trial end on such a satisfying note!
Congratulations, Harry!
Yes, you! I can practically see the headlines now: "Harry Butz, Innocent!"
Oh, no, I couldn't.
A present? For me? Wait... Wasn't this the evidence that...
R-really? You? You made this? ... Well, thank you. I'll keep it as a memento.
... Are you so sure?
I think she thought quite a lot of you, in her own way.
Oh, I'm not just sympathizing, really. Isn't that right, Wright? Don't you have something to show your friend? Something that proves how she felt about him?
Wright? I hope you see the importance of evidence now. Also, hopefully you realize, things change depending on how you look at them. People, too. We never really know if our clients are guilty or innocent. All we can do is believe in them. And in order to believe in them, you have to believe in yourself. Wright... Listen. Learn. Grow strong. Never let go of what you believe in. Never.
Well, I think our work here is done! Shall we be off?
Say, how about dinner. On me? We'll drink a toast to innocent Butz!
Oh, speaking of Harry... You were saying part of why you became a lawyer was because of him.
You'll have to tell me more about it sometime! Maybe... over drinks?

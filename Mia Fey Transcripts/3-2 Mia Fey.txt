Long time no see, Phoenix.
Now... Let's do this!
Not yet... The testimony's not over yet.
Your Honor! Just now you said something very interesting. "You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today."
Unfortunately, Your Honor, you're forgetting something. Earlier, after the last cross-examination... ...this witness made a number of remarks!
Very well... Then we shall prove their importance via cross-examination. At any rate! As long as the witness has made these remarks... ...we, the defense, assert our right to question them! Is that alright with you... Prosecutor?
The defense would like to hear why you declare the defendant to be the true murderer.
Phoenix? This is it. This is our absolute last chance.
...Well, Phoenix?
...So it would seem.
Listen, Phoenix. Pointing out contradictions... ...doesn't always mean you have to present evidence... does it? At any rate, this is our chance. If you can't point out a case-breaking contradiction... ...you lose. That's all there is to it.
Remember! You only get one chance!
As far as I can see, there is no evidence that contradicts his testimony. All you can do is press him. And you only get one shot.
As the defendant says, the rule of "Double Jeopardy" is absolute. A defendant can never be tried twice for a crime in which he was once found innocent.
For now... it would seem so.
You did it, Nick!
...Yeah. It's because Maya doesn't call on me much these days.
I'm just joking, Phoenix. Don't take everything so seriously. But on the other hand, Maya... She seems kind of lost these days.
Becoming the Master... means saying goodbye to our mother.
...Watch over her, will you Phoenix?
Well then... See you around.

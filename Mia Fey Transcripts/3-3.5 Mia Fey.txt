(Ugh... I'm so nervous. I feel like I'm going to die. I never should've accepted this case...) Eeeeeeek! ...Ah! G-G-Good morning! (Don't be so jumpy, Mia!)
(Terry Fawles... ...My first client. Sentenced to death 5 years ago, and now... a prison escapee.)
(Just relax, Mia! Make small talk and try to relax him!) ...Err, umm... So why did you escape anyway?
Eeeeek! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Err... But, Mr. Fawles... The police just recaptured you two days ago.
(Oh boy...)
Umm, sorry for asking but... You're on death row, right?
Eeeeeek! I'm really, really sorry!
(Two days ago, he escaped from the police wagon when it crashed... Then about 8 hours later... A policewoman was murdered before the police could recapture him. The police believe that Terry Fawles did it.) Umm... After you escaped, did you meet a policewoman?
(So that much is true... He did meet with the victim.)
(I can trust him... right? I mean, I should...)
Y-You're... Why are you here?
Err, where is Mr. Grossberg?
I-I didn't say... So, Diego Armando, the finest attorney at Grossberg Law Offices, is here for me...?
Yeah, err... Th-Thanks. (I sure wish I could get out of it though!)
R-Really!?
(G-Genius...?)
(A solitary confinement cell for the condemned must be the world's loneliest place. ...And that's what my client ran away from. Every other lawyer gave up on him... But not me. When I saw those overflowing eyes and heard that simple, child-like voice... I just had the feeling that he was telling the truth.)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm Mia Fey.
(Come on, Mia! You can't lose! Not to someone younger than you!)
So we're here to determine if Mr. Fawles was responsible for her death...?
A witness's testimony...
(So Ms. Hawthorne's testimony was the one that put him away...)
Huh?

W-Wait a minute! That's not right! At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!
(Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)
I don't believe anyone asked you about that.
Wh-What is it?
Excuse me?
(Here we go, Mia! Hang on...!)
Y-Yes, Your Honor! C-C-Cross-examination... Coming right up!
I-I-I'm not t-trembling! It-It-It's just cold in here!
I-I don't need you to worry about me...! I mean... I mean, the defendant, the witness... everyone's a beginner in here!
(It's OK, Mia. Stay calm... Just remember those court procedure videos you stayed up all last night watching!)

This "unknown person"... You have no idea who it might be, right?
What...?
A note...?
Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?)
(It's that detective's fault! He's the one that said, "unknown person"...!)
(Was that... a trap...? ...With that cute face, I didn't expect him to be so sneaky.)

A bridge up in the mountains? But why meet there?
...!

Was the body of the victim discovered right away?
(...Wait a second. Isn't there something weird about that...?)
Sergeant Hawthorne must have mentioned the phone call to someone else, right?
(I wonder why she didn't mention the phone call to anyone...?)

Mr. Fawles had a car, then?
(Is this guy sure about how he feels about ANYTHING?)
The victim... She was stabbed in the back, correct?
(We're talking about a woman here...)

What did the defendant have to say about this photo?
...


That certainly is some impressive police work.
...What do you mean it was too close for comfort?
(Hmm... That WAS kinda close. Any later and Mr. Fawles could have slipped right by.)
A t-trap?
No, it's NOT!
(The ever-famous "contradictions". I sure hope I can find some of those...)
...Witness! ............
I-I'm sorry! I-I totally forgot what I was going to say... This is... This is the first time I've ever had to actually address someone like that...
Candy?
(Grrr... Come on, Mia! Shake it off! You're a lawyer!) Detective!
This photo... You said that there was nothing peculiar about it. ...Is that correct?
Well then, I suggest you take another look at the note written by the victim!
It very clearly says, "Wear white scarf for identification."... The caller must have forgotten what the victim looked like. Thus, this special request.
I have one very simple question for you, Detective. Where is the white scarf? I can't seem to find it in this photo...
And you stopped there!? You should have looked for it!
...!
...Ah!
(Prosecutor Edgeworth... He was intentionally hiding that scarf the whole time!)
(Boy would I like to wrap this scarf around his smarmy little neck...)
(Argh... Everything is moving at his whim...)
(A genius, huh...)
Huh?
N-Not again! That's not fair! I haven't even done my cross-examination yet!
(What do you mean, "Hmm"!?)

Who is this eyewitness?
A female college student...?
Maybe so! But as the attorney for the defense, I have the right to cross-examine her...
Wh-What is that supposed to mean!?
Grrr...

(The victim is wearing a scarf in that photo alright.) So, about the witness who took this photo... What was this person doing all the way in the mountains?

Drizzling, huh?
...

Is that part of the witness's testimony as well?
... (Are you talking about seeing someone get pushed, or were you the one getting pushed? Or does it mean that you pushed someone down like that once...? With his mind-boggling tales and the way he said, "brutal", I wonder if he's Canadian...)
Huh...?
Hey! Watch where you spill your coffee! (The Court Record, huh...)


So in other words, there was a struggle between the criminal and the victim, huh?
(The area was wet from rain. The bridge was probably wet, too. Which would explain why the scarf was all covered in mud, but... There's something about this testimony that's still bothering me...)

S-So what do I do...Â ?
Of course I do!
So at the time of the crime, there was a light drizzle coming down, correct?
Well, I have evidence that doesn't go with the soggy atmosphere.
Considering the conditions at the scene of the crime, something isn't right.


Naturally, the answer is... right around HERE! ...I think.
What...?
(Oops! It looks like I really put my foot in my mouth that time!)
(Alright, Mia! You have got to think harder this time!)
Naturally the answer is... right here!
That's exactly what's strange! Remember the testimony! What were the conditions on the bridge that day? It was drizzling and foggy. Dusky Bridge was all wet. If the victim really had fallen down on her stomach on top of the bridge... ...then the front of her coat should have been covered in mud!
(The surface of the bridge, huh...)
(Neither would a real woman!) Of course I can!
Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!


The evidence is...
Wh-What is it? Your timing is terrible...!
What is THAT supposed to mean?
(Why didn't he just put it simply in the first place...?)
Y-Yes... I-I've changed my mind.
Yes, Your Honor! The defense is now prepared to show our evidence!
The evidence is... this scarf!
It should be obvious... If the scarf fell onto the bridge and got this muddy... It means that the bridge was obviously covered in mud!
(Hey! Same to you, buddy!)
Huh?
A-Alright...! (It's not like he's really giving me a choice here...)
M-Mr. Armando!
Th-That wasn't me, Your Honor! It was the coffee aficionado over here that said it!
...!
Y-Yes! The false evidence in this case is the...
About the photo that the prosecution claims was taken by a witness... It certainly seems to show a man in a prison uniform and a woman in a coat. However! We can't tell any more than that from the photo!
W-Well, that's certainly a possibility!
W-Well, I suppose that's also p-possible... I guess...
M-Mr. Armando!
(Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!)
If the victim really did try to repel her killer and if she did fall down on the bridge... ...then you would expect her coat to be dirty. Therefore! The body that was found in the trunk of the car... It was NOT the body of Valerie Hawthorne!
Uuurgh... (I guess he's right...)
(Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!)
It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious! During his earlier testimony, the detective pointed out a crucial fact. "The criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back." Now, is that testimony exactly what the witness claims to have seen?
That testimony... is filled with holes. After all, the victim's coat isn't dirty at all.
...Your Honor! The defense requests to cross-examine the eyewitness! The testimony presented so far is not only vague, but contradictory as well!
...?
(What Mr. Edgeworth said... kind of worries me... What does he mean by "the brutal truth"?)
(This is it, Mia! The battle begins here!)
(Everyone is so silent that I can hear their hearts going pitter-patter...)
(Hey, hey! Not so fast!)
(...If he's such a gentleman, he sure doesn't act like one to me.)
Now then... May we please have your name and occupation?
...And you were the one who took this photo? Is that accurate?
Huh? B-But it's just a photograph! It's not like it's something dangerous!
(Uh oh... I don't like the turn this has taken...)
...? (Is she... staring at me?)
Huh? I-I'm the defense lawyer. ...My name is Mia Fey.

Did you say... "wild flowers"?
Umm... But it's only February.

Was there anything strange about the two of them?
(Too much info, Your Honor!)

Do you have any idea what they were fighting about?
Oh, I just thought that maybe you overheard what they said...
...!
(Grrrr...!)

Why did you take a photo?
(Smells like a lie to me...)
(So he wanted to be a comedian, huh. ...Not that it has any bearing on this.)

...Witness. When you said you took a photo of the crucial moment, is this what you meant?
All I can see in this photo are two people facing each other. You testified that you saw the two of them starting to fight. Normally that's the kind of thing we would refer to as a crucial moment! Why haven't you presented a photo like that!?
But if you really wanted to capture the crucial moment... ...then what happened next? You must have taken a photo of it!
(He can certainly downplay a situation, can't he...)
What!?
The witness herself? Then who took the photos?
So, you took photos of yourself!?
(Please! No details...!)
W-Wait! Just a minute!
(Boy, this guy is really a sucker for sweet talk...)
Yeah, it's sickening.

You called the police?

The victim... Why do you think she tried to run away?
With her police training, she certainly knew better than to turn her back on a criminal...
("Quaggy"!? Why you...!)
(There's still something wrong with this testimony...)


So you're saying Sergeant Hawthorne wasn't able to get away from him...?
I wonder about that... Something seems kind of off...

(If Terry Fawles isn't the criminal... Then there must be something strange in that girl's testimony!)
(You're going to have to come up with something really good, Mia!)
Witness! Your testimony is a joke!
One short testimony and two bad contradictions... There's no possible excuse!
It's simple. Just take a look at the diagram of the area. According to her testimony, the two of them were in the middle of the bridge. But if they were, and the victim had turned around and tried to run... Well, then...
You said 10 yards, but she couldn't have ran even 5! Because Dusky Bridge is collapsed on that side!
It's very simple, Your Honor. This charming, little witness told a charming, little lie. That's all there is to it.
(M-Mr. Edgeworth...!)
What did you say!?
Th-That's ridiculous...!
Huh? What do you mean?
(What!? That coward!)
...!
D-Don't say that...!
This trial isn't over yet!
(The contradiction is staring you right in the face, Mia! Go on the attack!)

Are you saying that the victim didn't fall down on the bridge?

If you don't mind, I was asking the witness!
...

You personally witnessed that?
Did anything strange happen when he did that?

You mean the defendant carried the body all by himself?
Yes, but... Let's remember they were on a narrow bridge that was ready to collapse! Is it even possible for him to have carried a dead body on a bridge like that...?
(Wow... Why did he get so emotional all of a sudden?)

A killer not wanting his victim to be found... I can understand that. However! The idea of moving the body for that purpose is clearly odd. There was a much easier way to make sure the body wasn't found!
Take another look at the map of the area and you'll see how. There's a river right below the bridge. Earlier Mr. Edgeworth pointed out something interesting about the river.
In the kidnapping case 5 years ago, the victim's body was carried away and never found.
If 10 murders were to occur at that same spot above the Eagle River... ...you can bet your boots that every other killer would have tossed the body in the water!
What are you talking about?

But what the witness claims to have seen is totally ridiculous...
Ugh...
(Who is he talking about!?)

What did the man do then?
You're sure that you saw all that with your own eyes?


Why do you say that? It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it?
But it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct?

And you're absolutely certain that it was my client who was carrying the body?
(Something about this testimony is bothering me, but what...?)
No... Why would I!?
Huh...?
...
(He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)
Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.
Made a crucial mistake.
"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there." You're saying you saw that, right? With your very own eyes?
It's simple, Ms. Foster. Take a look at the diagram. The place you claim to have taken the photo from that day is here. Do you see what I mean? Even if you tried to see the car... ...this outcropping of rock is directly in the way.
That's right, Ms. Foster.
From where you were standing, you could not have possibly seen the killer's car.
I'm so sorry... But that just doesn't wash.
I believe it was the witness who presented this as evidence to the court, yes? This is the location that the photo was taken from. Your own photo tells the whole story! You can clearly see the left side of the bridge... But the outcropping that is being referred to is really more like a cliff.
Your view should have been completely cut off by this cliff! But still you claim to have been able to see the killer's car!

But she was repeatedly warned before starting her testimony! She was told to testify only about what she saw with her own eyes!

Hey! Wait a minute! You can't just say that...!
What...!? Th-That's not fair...!
M-Mr. Armando!
B-But...! But that wasn't fair!
Aha...!
(The judge is on her side! I can't make any mistakes here! What she just said... Is there a contradiction in there somewhere...?)
(Something about it still doesn't feel right, but...) I, err... OK, I guess I'm satisfied... Sort of.
Huh...?
(Contradiction...!? So that wasn't my imagination after all!)

J-Just a minute!
I've got a big problem with what this witness said!
(Ugh... Hang in there, Mia!)
Melissa Foster. It looks like you've finally betrayed yourself.
You said you were in a field taking photos of wild flowers. But even so, you knew about the scratches... The question is when! When did you get a chance to see those scratches!?
(Finally...! I've finally got her!)
Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation! The reason the witness had seen the scratches was...
Because she just happened to be passing by the area where the car was parked!
(Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!)
Because the stolen car actually belonged to her. That is why she knew about the scratches!
(Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!)
There's only one way that the witness had the chance to see those scratches.
Naturally... When she opened the trunk... and stuffed the corpse in herself!
The person who really hid the body in the trunk of that car was... Melissa Foster! It was you that did it, wasn't it!?
I don't think so, Ms. Foster. If Mr. Fawles had been the one that put the corpse in the trunk... ...he would have simply used the car key. There was no need to break it open.
He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Which means that the key would have still been in the ignition.
Thank you for telling us about the scratches, Ms. Foster. Without that, we never would have uncovered the truth. It couldn't have been Mr. Fawles that put the body in the trunk!
(Now is your chance, Mia! Finish this thing!) On the contrary, I'm not so certain about that anymore, Mr. Edgeworth.
There's no need to think too deeply about it. What I'm saying is the shutter for this may not have been pushed by Ms. Foster herself!


Well, Your Honor?
Huh?
(That's what I thought, but...)
I don't think you can make a mistake about it. Take a look at her camera. It has a timer built into it! Even a mini-tripod!
Almost as if the camera was brought just to take this picture!
(Well, if she really did use the camera's auto-timer... ...then the answer is yes, she was somewhere else.) Exactly. She was NOT in the field.


Naturally the witness was right... here! ...I think.
Yes! She had to put the body in the trunk before the defendant returned!
(Uh oh. He's got that condescending tone in his voice...)
Err...
... Well, it COULD have been a spirit... Right?
A-Anyway! I still maintain that the witness was in a different place at the time!
Yes, I am certain! More or less.

Naturally, the witness was standing right here!
(Oh don't worry, the drift was certainly caught...)
Ah, yes... Thank you...
Naturally, the witness was right here!
Your Honor, if I may... After parting with the "victim" on the bridge, the defendant fled by car. But this would mean that there was no time to put the victim in the trunk. In other words, if someone put the body in the trunk... ...it could only have been before the defendant met the "victim"!

You still don't understand, do you, Mr. Edgeworth? By the time the witness's photo was taken, the victim was already dead... The person in the photo was NOT Valerie Hawthorne!
It's obvious, isn't it? It's your own witness.
It's the only possible explanation. The woman that Mr. Fawles met on the bridge that day was not Valerie Hawthorne! It was you! Melissa Foster!
Let's remember that it was raining and foggy on the mountain that day. Mr. Fawles himself believed that the woman in front of him was Valerie Hawthorne!

But since then, my client has spent five hard years in a federal penitentiary! He couldn't remember exactly what she looked like anymore!
(I've got it all right here! This piece of evidence will blow this case wide open...!) At the time of the incident, Mr. Fawles had forgotten what Valerie Hawthorne looked like!


M-Mr. Armando...
(H-He's right, Mia! You need to calm down and think it over!)
Mr. Fawles had forgotten the victim's face. That's why he needed some piece of identification. Namely, this muddy scarf!
It was Mr. Fawles who requested that she wear this scarf to identify herself. That's already been proven by the note the victim left!
In other words, as long as you were wearing a scarf like he asked... ...anyone could have pretended to be Valerie Hawthorne!
Well? What do you have to say to that, Melissa Foster!?
(It's obvious that Melissa Foster did it. She hid the body in the trunk and disguised herself as the victim... She set up the camera to snap a fake photo of them together...)
Well, isn't that obvious? She's the true criminal!
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Fawles, I...
Eeeeeek! I'm sorry! I-I'm sorry!
Thanks! We're almost there! Once I prove that she committed the crime...
Ob-Obstacle...?
(Motive, huh...)
Information... Right...
...What is it?
Mr. Fawles! In that case... Tell us more about it. ...About what happened 5 years ago.
(So it's been broken like that for at least 5 years...)
Y-Your g-girlfriend? Huh...?
(The victim's last name...!)
Wh-Wh-Whaaat!? Are you serious!?
(The detective back then was Valerie Hawthorne!) At first I thought shooting someone for a kidnapping was crossing the line, but... If it was to protect her little sister, I can understand why she did it...
What do you mean she betrayed you!?
A make-believe kidnapping?
(Ugh. Did he actually say, "My Teen Angel"? He's seen one too many soap operas.)
("Anything Dahlia says"...?) H-Hold on a minute! What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...
(Valerie was in on it!?)
Jump...? You don't mean she jumped on purpose, do you?
(So that's why... That's why you made a crazy escape like that...)
...Huh? Where's what?
Huh? You don't know?
...With Dahlia?
(It disappeared with Dahlia, huh...? Wait a minute...!)
Mr. Fawles! Just one more question! When you said, "with Dahlia", do you mean the diamond is still missing...? Along with the body of Dahlia Hawthorne?
(They never found her...!)
F-F-Fourteen!? (I guess you were robbing cradles before diamonds...)
(Fawles takes the fall... And gets a one-way ticket to Death Row... Is Dahlia Hawthorne an angel or is she really a...)
...You bet!
(Not this again...)
What are you talking about!?
(Her motive, huh... I figured that's what I had to establish next...)
... Err, yes! Of course! ...I think.
Mr. Armando...
...!
...Maybe so, but I wish you would quit grinning at me like that.
Wh-What do you mean!?
Y-You bet! (Somehow, I have to tie her to this case...)

So, what country were you living in then?
(What kind of sob story is this...? ...What do I do? Should I press her for details?)
(There's nothing I can do about her claim to have lost all her identification. All I can do is wait to find some other evidence about her real identity.)
...Witness. Answer my question. I'll even repeat it for you. What country were you in?

You didn't know either person? Are you certain of that?
(Why is he just agreeing with everything that comes out of her mouth...?)

So what made you decide to go to Eagle Mountain anyway?
(...You don't look like much of a hiker to me. But you do look like a digger of sorts.) But Eagle Mountain is a two-hour drive from here and no trains run through there. There are plenty of mountains that are closer and easier to get to.
(Didn't know you were such a goth...) By the way, what's the name of your college...?
...!
(I hardly said anything! Talk about sensitive...)

Perhaps, but your behavior that day was very suspicious! Not only have you contradicted yourself here in court, but you know things you shouldn't. For example, the scratches on the trunk of the car.
Oh really!? And why is that?
Th-That's not fair...!

A grudge...?

My client has always maintained that he's innocent of those charges!
...!
What do you mean by that?
(Well, she's right about that. Mr. Fawles is kind of forgetful...)
(Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...)
(...And how does this relate to anything!?)
You said, "he forgot what the detective looked like." What did you mean by that?
(This is bad. Mr. Fawles's reputation just keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it's best not to poke too deep... What should I do with that last statement?)
Your Honor! What the witness said just now was tremendously important! I'd like it added to the official testimony!
N-No, that's not why I...
(Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...)
(...And how does this relate to anything!?)

What do you mean by lucky?
Mr. Armando...

Witness... I want you to look at this photo you took. It's hard to see in the photo, but look at the scarf the victim wore as identification.
(I've got her now, just don't mess up...) ...But that's strange. In your testimony, you stated the following... "I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf."
...This is the scarf you identified as belonging to the victim. But it certainly doesn't look white to me!

Sorry, but not this time. The witness just confirmed that this was the victim's scarf!
There's only one explanation for this mix-up! The reason why the witness thought the scarf was white is...!

...Witness. Have you ever seen this note?
Hmm, I wonder about that...
This note shows Mr. Fawles's instructions to the victim regarding their meeting. It says... "Wear white scarf for identification."
Witness! You KNEW what this note said! There's no other possible reason for you to mistake the scarf's color!

Here's the definitive piece of evidence that proves it!
Yes! ...If my thinking is correct.
Huh?
(Well, that wasn't what I was expecting...)

...It's true. Mr. Fawles did give instructions to Valerie Hawthorne about their meeting. The note that she left said: "Wear white scarf for identification."
Isn't it obvious!? Doesn't it strike you as odd!? That note was a secret piece of evidence! How is it that the witness knows about it!?
In that case, the only way the witness could know about the note would b--
(Come on, Mia! You can't let her weasel out of it that easily!) ...Witness! Sorry, but your explanation isn't going to work here.
Impossible. There's no way you could have seen the victim use a white scarf to signal him!

You've said several times in your testimony that the victim was wearing a scarf... ...A white scarf, correct?
That's what I'd like to know. ...Ms. Foster. Have a look at this. It's the victim's scarf!
I'm sure people would disagree about what to call this color. ...However! It certainly is not white! You KNEW what the note said!
It says, "Wear white scarf for identification." That's the reason why you said it was white!

Here's the definitive piece of evidence that proves it!
Yes! ...If my thinking is correct.
Huh?
(Well, that wasn't what I was expecting...)
(Come on, Mia! You're running out of time...!)

You knew about that incident? But weren't you out of the country until the year before last?
(I can't let her get away with these lies...!)
Well, Ms. Foster!?
And yet...! This witness knew exactly what the note said! At the time of the murder, the number of people that knew were quite... limited. Terry Fawles is one. The person who wrote the note, Valerie Hawthorne, is another. And finally... One more person.
Yup! The third person that knew the contents of the note was...!


What is it, Mr. Armando?
Umm... Why are you doing this?
(Oops... I think it's too late...) B-But Your Honor...! Th-There is one more person! There is a person besides Mr. Fawles and the victim that knew what the note said.
And that person is... Dahlia Hawthorne!
Look at the victim's note. This is what it says... "Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time..." There is her name, right there.

You said she was "killed"... But was she really?
Of course, people thought she had died 5 years ago... ...when she fell off of Dusky Bridge and was lost in the Eagle River. However! Her corpse was never found!

But the fact remains that her body was never recovered! Dahlia Hawthorne was 14 years old, 5 years ago. If she were still alive, she would be 19 now. ...Melissa Foster. I believe that's the same age you are!
But I am. That's precisely what I'm saying. This "witness" before us is the girl that was kidnapped and killed 5 years ago! This girl is in fact Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne!
I... I understand. (If I can expose her true nature, I can turn this whole case on its head! Now is my chance to make Mr. Edgeworth squirm...!)
Wh-What did he say...?
No way...! But then why...!
Why!? Why did she hide her identity for 5 years!?

Accidental...? I don't believe that for a minute! For the last 5 years, she's been playing the role of victim! And now we find her acting suspiciously at another murder scene!
H-How dare you!
Whaaaaat!?
W-Well you see... (I thought I was winning, but somehow he's turned it around on me!)
Ah! That wasn't me! It was this guy... This crazy coffee addict...
Ah...! (I AM sweating bullets!)
Of course! Aren't I?
(Up to me...?)
(This coming from someone younger than me!)


Oh, that was... The rashness of youth!
(OK, one more time, Mia! You gotta read the Court Record more carefully this time!)
...The story starts after Terry Fawles escaped. He called Valerie and told her he wanted to meet. This is the note she left... It says, "Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time, the whole truth must come out." ...Valerie Hawthorne gave Dahlia a warning. She told her she was going to reveal to the world the whole truth.
There was a dangerously important secret between Valerie and Dahlia. That's the reason Dahlia felt she had to kill Valerie... To keep her mouth shut permanently!
Oh, yes... I know this secret. ...Your Honor! The defense would like to request further testimony.
Regarding the kidnapping 5 years ago. We believe it will explain a lot of things. Such as the nature of the important secret between the Hawthorne sisters!
(Putting on the old charm one more time, Dahlia? But this will be the last time you hide behind your womanly wiles!)
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
(...Mr. Edgeworth got the jump on me again...)
...What info?
(That's right, it was a fake kidnapping! Terry Fawles told us that in the lobby.)
What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...
(Yes! That's it! The fake kidnapping is your best shot, Mia! That's her secret!)

Did you and Mr. Fawles have a relationship?
You were tutoring him? Mr. Fawles?
(That makes sense... 5 years ago, she was only 14.)
(Did I hear him right!? Did he just call Mr. Fawles a clever fellow?)

I heard the diamond is valued in the neighboorhood of 2 million dollars.
By the way, I want to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth. Why do you think he wanted to make the exchange up there on that mountain? If he ever got surrounded, it would be hard to escape...
(Yeah, right. It was all YOUR plan...)

That was a dangerous thing to do considering you were being held hostage.
...!

I'd like to hear more about what happened right at that moment!


And that's why you hid your identity?

And that new identity was "Melissa Foster", right?
(That makes sense... Without an insider's help, doing all of the paperwork would've been impossible.)
(I've just got to prove that kidnapping was a hoax!)
You say that Mr. Fawles pushed you into the Eagle River... However, that's hard to believe.
I'm sorry... I guess I wasn't clear enough. I shouldn't have said, "that's hard to believe." I should've said, "That's impossible."
I ask that the court recall the condition of Dusky Bridge, now and 5 years ago. That bridge hasn't changed one bit in these last 5 years. If someone had pushed you from behind as you have claimed... ...instead of being carried away by the river... ...you would have been smashed by the bedrock below! A most certain death.
Do you understand now, Dahlia Hawthorne? The very notion that my client pushed you from behind is impossible!

But it's 40 feet from the bridge to the river! A small change in the water level wouldn't have made a difference!
What... What do you mean?
You can't be serious!

(Not now, Mia...! This is no time to retreat!) Unfortunately for you... this is just the start of Ms. Fey's assault!
I believe your reasoning went something like this, Mr. Edgeworth. "After being shot in the arm, it's plausible that Mr. Fawles panicked! Therefore, he could have unwittingly pushed her off the side of the bridge!" However! Once again, I'm forced to say, "That's impossible!"
Because your flawed logic contradicts the Court Record!


This evidence shows the fatal error you've made!
(Uh-oh, here it comes...)
Ouchie. (Come on, Mia! Take your time and think it over again!)
Your Honor! All of the answers are right here in this photo! Take a look at the wires supporting both sides of the bridge! They extend up to about five feet off the ground... It would be impossible to push someone off from there!

So young, and already so forgetful, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Fawles had been shot in the right arm.
And more importantly... ...Valerie Hawthorne had her gun trained on him... at point-blank range!
So! Mr. Fawles throwing the witness off the bridge? That is clearly impossible!
Dahlia Hawthorne! You jumped into the Eagle River intentionally!

Perhaps... But still, that's exactly what you did! You were probably confident that you could handle the swift current. But even more so... ...the witness had a much more compelling reason for jumping into the river!
The witness is still alive. This fact alone explains everything! This is why she risked her life by jumping into the rapids of the Eagle River!


(This is an easy one, Mia! What was it she was after...? Even Edgeworth must have realized it...!)
Five years ago... ...something else disappeared along with Dahlia that day. The item that Valerie brought up the mountain with her... The 2 million dollar diamond!
Yes. Dahlia had it all planned from the beginning! The 2 million dollars... She was going to keep it all for herself! She forced Mr. Fawles to help her fake the kidnapping...
At the last minute, she betrayed him and threw herself into the river... ...with the ransom tucked away safely in her backpack...
This woman IS a demon. And there was one more person who helped make a demon out of her. Her sister... Valerie Hawthorne.
Precisely! I'm sure that it weighed heavily on her conscience for the past 5 years. This is the sole reason behind the victim's murder.
On the day of the murder... ...after receiving the phone call from Mr. Fawles, Valerie called her sister, Dahlia. And then she told her what she was planning to do.
THAT is what sealed Valerie Hawthorne's fate... THAT is when you hatched your demonic plan to kill two birds with one stone. A plan that would ensure neither of your accomplices to the kidnapping would talk. And THAT is why... ...you killed your sister, Valerie Hawthorne!
...!
Ev-Evidence...?
W-Well, I...
I... I don't know...
Nnrgh...! (How can I prove a fake kidnapping that happened 5 years ago!? I don't even have decisive proof of Valerie Hawthorne's murder...)
(Is this it...? Is it really over...? That girl has made a fool of me and there's nothing I can do about it!)
M-Mr. Armando!
(T-Testimony...?)
Y-Yes, that's right...
(Since there's no proof, there's only one thing left to do! Who is the one person who can testify to that demon woman's crimes...?)


(Relax, Mia! This is easy...!)
Your Honor! The defense wishes to call a new witness!
Yes! We would like to hear the testimony of Terry Fawles!
There's only one person that can shed any further light on the situation... Only one person that knows what Dahlia's role in the kidnapping was... Only one person that can say whether the person in the photo is Valerie Hawthorne... ...or whether it was in fact her younger sister Dahlia, disguised as her. There's only one person who can solve this riddle once and for all... And that person is... Terry Fawles!
(This is my last chance, Mr. Fawles... My last chance to establish Dahlia's guilt... You're all I have left!)
Mr. Fawles... I don't know what she said to you 5 years ago, but one thing is clear. Dahlia is very much alive. And you were used. For 2 million dollars.
Hmm?
Mr. Fawles! You're covering for her! Do you think she would do the same for you...!?
...!
(Is this how you want it to end, Mr. Fawles? Another guilty verdict to go along with your death sentence!?)

According to the note, the meeting was supposed to take place at 4:30. You certainly arrived early, didn't you?
You waited on the bridge for 30 minutes?
Mr. Fawles...?
... (Why did he just clam up? Could it be... he's hiding something here?)

You were quite early, so you waited on the bridge, correct?


You were watching the car?
(I suppose that's the obvious thing to do, but... ...something's bothering me. I'm getting that feeling... A contradiction?)


Mr. Fawles. Think carefully now. Are you certain that it was Valerie Hawthorne?
Wait a minute. If you had remembered her face... ...then why did you make her wear a scarf as identification?
......


What did you talk to her about anyway?
Mr. Fawles!
...!
(But you just saw that she isn't dead!)


How can you be so sure!? It was raining at the time, and sunset that day was at 5 o'clock. It would have already been pretty dark on that mountain at 4:30!
Please Mr. Fawles! This is your last chance! You've already taken the fall once for something you didn't do!
(Even if it means the death penalty. Even if it means taking the blame for murder... You'll still do whatever is necessary to protect her... Won't you, Mr. Fawles?)
Mr. Fawles...
So when you got to the bridge, no one had arrived, huh? So you waited on the bridge... You're sure of that?
You're sure, huh...? Well then I'm sure too, Mr. Fawles... I'm sure that you're lying.
You want to know who arrived at the bridge first? Just look at this photo. It's perfectly clear. Obviously the person that came first would be the one at the end of the bridge, right?
Precisely my point. In other words, Mr. Fawles... You must have arrived at the bridge after she did.
... Umm, Mr. Fawles. Please don't get so worked up. We just want the truth.
...!
A memento...?
Your Honor! You heard what my client said. He arrived at the scene at 4 o'clock. But he then left his car unattended and walked away! He was gone for approximately 30 minutes!
With that much time... ...Dahlia Hawthorne could have easily hidden the body in the trunk of his car!
(I've still got a chance!) Mr. Fawles! There's no mistaking it!
Huh? Mr. Fawles...!?
No! We are so close! Just a little more... I was going to prove your innocence!
Mr. Fawles!
MR. FAAAAAAAAWLES!!!!
And so my first trial ended... Suddenly, and tragically. It ended with no winners... Only losers. I ended up with a wound that cut so deep into my soul, I thought it'd never heal. I'm sure it was the same for the young prosecutor as well. But one person... The true criminal, Dahlia Hawthorne... She left the courtroom with a secret smile on her demonically sweet face.
M-Mr. Armando...
It's my fault! It's all my fault that Mr. Fawles killed himself!
I-I knew it...! I kn-knew I wasn't cut out for this...!
...!
M-Mr. Armando...

Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!?
... I guess I don't think anything of it either...
(If there wasn't a problem, couldn't he just let it slide...?)

Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
... That could very well be...
(What's the problem!? Pointer fingers are made for pointing!)

This evidence establishes that the defendant is lying, right?
S-Sorry... This is my first time handling a case...
(And here I thought he would go easy on me because I'm new...)

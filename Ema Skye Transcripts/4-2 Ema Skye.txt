Ahem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here?
Him again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off limits.
...Hmm. One moment.
.............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala.
It's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found.
So, you're a defense attorney, are you? Detective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene.
I trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case.
Hey there! No messing with the crime scene!
Hey there! No messing with the crime scene!
Investigations are to be carried out by professionals, scientifically!
Quiet, please. It's snack time. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
*sigh* I never seem to get a lucky break. Back after nine years, and they won't give me the position I requested... ...And then I hear he gave up the defense attorney life...
...Can't you see that I am extremely, extremely busy?
Ah! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that?
You... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes?
D-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were?
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!?
W-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can!
This powder is used for detecting fingerprints.
I guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright.
If you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints!
Don't touch those! Those are preserving the crime scene!
A "shiv" to be precise.
The defendant, Wocky Kitaki, is the son of known gangsters. The police are assuming this belongs to him.
A handprint? Then there might be a fingerprint. Let's investigate!
Right! First, choose the fingerprint you want to examine.
Look closely at the handle. See? There's more than one fingerprint there.
That's right. Pick the one you want to analyze.
Right! Let's get detecting!
First, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. Just touch the screen, like this. See? The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off!
It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...
Heh heh. Isn't it though?
Incidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder.
Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to.
OK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already.
Yes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life.
Look sharp, spirits up. The real fight is yet to come!
The body of the victim has already been removed.
The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body.
Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here.
A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol.
Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age.
Incidentally, the victim's name was Pal Meraktis. I just received the autopsy report, in fact.
I mean, really! What's up with this case!? It's enough to make me want to run off, pulling a mysterious noodle stand behind me...
A likely story! I didn't come here to play games, you know.
... Look, I have better things to be doing. I'd make more progress eating snacks than listening to this drivel.
... Who's the old guy?
Not bad. I guess Mr. Wright picked the right kids for the job. That saved me a lot of work. Thanks.
You mean what did he do? He was a doctor.
Who? Me? I'm just a supervisor for this crime scene.
I was out of the country for a while. I came back to be a forensic scientist.
Something like that. I was studying in Europe. Forensic sciences, mind you. But when I got back here, they threw me in criminal affairs! Just like that!
Well, I suppose that was an option, but... I had a lot of favors to repay to people back here.
What? What's that look for? I was involved in an... incident before I left. But Mr. Wright and his people helped me out. I owed them.
Wocky Kitaki. I don't know if he is the boss's son, but he's certainly throwing his weight around... ...Violently. In the detention center.
... You are a defense attorney, aren't you? You're not his, by any chance?
Well... We have a witness to the moment of the crime.
The witness called the police. They'll be testifying during the trial tomorrow.
Well, let's see... Apparently he's the physician at a clinic in the area. Quite well off, too, from the sound of it. The clinic's name is... The Meraktis Clinic.
What? You've been to the clinic?
...I see... So that means... ...Dr. Meraktis stole the stand and pulled it all the way here?
... But why?
Ah, an attorney's badge. It reminds me of when Mr. Wright was still defending. Everything I have now is thanks to him. Remember, help as many people as you can. That's your job!
Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Doesn't just talking about it leave you breathless with excitement?
Let me know if you find any evidence that might have a print or two, alright?
The defendant's fingerprints were found on that knife.
It's highly possible, yes.
No use worrying about what's out already! You just worry about what's yet to come!
Why did Dr. Meraktis die like this...?
Inconceivable! I just don't get it! Some people just can't die normally!
Sorry... I don't think I can help you with that. I think you need more than just scientific help. But ask me anything you like! ...Just ask scientifically.
So... have you met the defendant?
Visiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over.
Don't worry, it's like a Wright tradition.
Hey, you there! If you're going to talk about someone behind their back, do it more quietly, please!
This is miserable! Miserable! I just got a new kit, and I can't get the stuff to work. And everyone's all smiles for that glimmerous fop.
When he walks his shiny chains catch the sun and glimmer in my eyes! It's distracting. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
*sigh* I guess I just have to accept the fact that I lack talent.
Ah? Ah... Well... ...He helped me out a long time ago. You might say he "saved" me.
I can't stand it when things are vague... especially in a case. I went to study to become a forensic scientist... in Europe.
Well... I failed the test. But, you know, rank and title don't matter! What matters is what's inside your heart!
And my heart is full of science! That's why I bought this kit through mail order. And I'm going to test it here before the forensics team arrives!
I won't lie, I'm not fond of the man. Those glimmerous types always rub me the wrong way.
A prosecutor should be cool of wit and furrowed of brow. Less "glimmerous" and more "simmerous"... you know?
Well, that, and what happened seven years ago! Prosecutor Gavin was the one who stripped Mr. Wright of his attorney's badge!
...You mean you didn't know? I thought you were one of his boys!
...Then investigate. It's better you learned it for yourself, anyway.
Ooh! You want to know? Do you? Well, I splurged on a new toy!
This is a footprint analysis kit!
It was raining on the night of the murder, which means that footprints were left!
Right. The ground was muddy, so I had to protect it as it was that night. Ever wanted to know exactly where someone was standing? Like your panty-snatching student witness, for instance?
Right!
Want to try this stuff out?
Oh, pshaw! You're friends! And... to tell the truth, I'm not so good at doing this. Guess I'm a little clumsy. I could use your help.
Really? That's too bad... I really could use the help.
That's the spirit! Right, allow me to explain! Ahem, one moment...
First, we have to pick the footprint, or in this case, shoe print we want to analyze! I've taken the liberty of marking all the shoe prints in the park. Well, which shoe print should we start with...? If we're going to verify the defendant's account, here's the place to start! Shoe prints, prepare to be examined!
Right, here goes! First... "Pour the plaster into the print until it's full." ...You try it.
Just touch the screen where you want to pour the plaster. Like this!
If you run out of plaster in your beaker before you're done, you have to start over!
What are you doing!? Out of plaster already?
I'm not that far ahead of you believe me! ...Fine. I'll make another batch. DOn't mess it up this time.
Not bad. You're handier with that than you look.
On to the next step! Um... "Dry the plaster until it turns white." Right! Just touch to direct the dryer! ...There, give it a shot!
Looks like it's hardened nicely. Let's take a look! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink! Ready for the next step? Use the roller to ink just the shoe print part. Hold on to that roller tight now, and roll it up and down. Keep going till you get enough ink on there for a good print!
Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Let's see if we get a match.
Hmm, no good. Must have messed up somewhere. Shall we try on another print?
He was in the park on the night of the crime!
Don't you love it!? Ahhh! Nothing feels better.
Just let me know if you want to do some more. I'll be here, solving the case... with science!
Hmm? Still interested in the bleeding edge of forensic science? Why didn't you say so in the first place!?
Right on! Leave no print un-analyzed, I say! ...Now to pick which print you want to analyze!
...OK! Looking good. Next, to dry the plaster!
OK, let's take out the mold! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink!
Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Let's see if we get a match.
Hmm, no good. Must have messed up somewhere. Shall we try on another print?
Now we know where the panty-snatcher was standing!
...OK! Looking good. Next, to dry the plaster!
OK, let's take out the mold! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink!
It is strange. So smooth...
I can say without even looking that this print doesn't match any print on our list.
Huh? Giving up already? Suit yourself. If you want to take another swing at it, just let me know.
I believe you're beginning to appreciate the wonder that is forensic science!
I wish there were more prints to analyze... *sniffle* I know! Quick! Step in that mud over there!
*sigh* I would have had fun.
This print is far too smooth to be from a regular shoe.
Still, you have to wonder what it's doing here.
It does make one wonder... ...Hey, you.
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? ...You wouldn't happen to have something in mind? Something that might have left this mystery shoe print?
Too bad. I wonder what it is.
...Well, if you think of something, I'm all ears.
... Know what I'm eating?
Snacks. More precisely, whenever I'm in a bad mood, I eat chocolate Snackoos.
Slippers... What would slippers be doing out here?
It's covered with paint! Except for...
Hey, that spot is shaped like a leaf!
Wait, something's written on them... ..."The Meraktis Clinic"!
...
Wh-What?
... I should be able to do something for you, yes.
Well, you did my work for me here with the shoe prints. Seems like I should return the favor.
Here, show this to the police officer on duty.
Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science!
And you two know how to dust for prints on your own now! Make sure to examine anything you find that might have prints on it!
They say "The Meraktis Clinic"... Hey!
This slipper... Look right here! I think I see a toe mark!
Sure! Toes have prints just like fingers do, you know.
Oh... There's one problem. The police station doesn't keep a record of toe prints. So we won't know whose it is.
I know that face. That's the face of someone who's made... a discovery!
You can't fool someone trained in the ways of science!
Hmm. The bulb's broken.
Really? I break bulbs all the time. My desk is a mess and my lamp is always falling over. ...Not too bright, huh?
...What did I tell you before? If you're going to talk behind someone's back, do it quietly.
...Do I have to repeat myself every time? If you're going to talk behind someone's back, do so quietly!
Ah, the slippers... That's quite a clear print there. ...A toe print.
Well, there is a way of finding out, of course.
All you need is a sample of the same toe print, off another shoe, for instance.
Ah well, it was too much to hope for, I suppose. Let me know if you find something.
Really!?
...
...Of course it matches. It's the same evidence as before!
What are you thinking, trying to compare something with itself!?
Try again! And... try scientifically, please.
... I did say "toe print" sample, didn't I? Where exactly is the toe print on this evidence!?
Try again. Scientifically this time, if you would.
Ooh! The print on these is nice and clear, too. That makes our job easy.
Of course! Hang on...
Bingo! Gosh, I'm good.
A perfect match! The same person wore these sandals and slippers!
All you have to do is find out who these sandals belong to! Or... do you already know?
Hmm... Yes... Yes!
Well, scientifically speaking... These are a pair of woman's sandals. Pretty cute, too.
Hmm? Say, this sandal has a toe mark...
That I do! You can analyze it just like a fingerprint!
Oh... There's one problem. The police station doesn't keep a record of toe prints. So we won't know whose it is.
These sandals... That's quite a clear print there. ...A toe print.
Well, there is a way of finding out, of course.
All you need is a sample of the same toe print, off another shoe, for instance.
Ah well, it was too much to hope for, I suppose. Let me know if you find something.

Bingo! Gosh, I'm good.
A perfect match! The same person wore these sandals and slippers!
All you have to do is find out who these sandals belong to! Or... do you already know?
Well, if the prints on these slippers and these sandals match, which they do... ...it means that the same person was wearing them.
It is, isn't it!? I've never felt so alive!
Huh? Giving up already? Suit yourself. If you want to take another swing at it, just let me know.
What are you doing!? Out of plaster already?
I'm not that far ahead of you, believe me! ...Fine. I'll make another batch. Don't mess it up this time.

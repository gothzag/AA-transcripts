...
Yes! That's right! Is... something wrong?
Young? I'll be sixteen years old this year!
I'm set to be formally assigned to Forensics in three more years. My work is becoming quite well known... At my age, no less!
Well, legally speaking... I guess you'd call me an "Eleventh Grader." But I'm ready to do my job! At my age, no less!
My sister didn't do it! She wouldn't stab someone with a knife! She wouldn't!
I don't care if there's a witness who saw her do it! She didn't do it! I know she didn't do it! It's a scientific fact!
J-just talk to her! You have to talk to her!
I promised her I'd bring Mia Fey, but...
E-excuse me? I'm not a child, I'll have you know!
I believe investigations should be done scientifically! Don't you?
If this case is handled scientifically, I'm sure my sister's name will be cleared!
I've been doing research, you know! I'm developing a new scientific method of case investigation! I'll show you when I'm done!
My sister asked for her specifically. Mia Fey... was a few years below her in school.
She always told me to go to Mia if I ever needed a defense attorney... And, well... I need one.
Mia... Yeah, I thought it was a little strange when I saw you, too.
...
Well... Actually, when she gets like she is now, I kind of hate her.
But... But she's my only family.
They died in a car accident when I was little.
Ahh! Well! I've never seen a real one before.
Its composition is mostly silver. The gold plating is flaking a bit.
There doesn't appear to be any corrosion due to sulfides. I'd give you $50.00 for it.
...
H-hi, Lana.
L-look... I didn't want to come here either, okay? But your trial's tomorrow and you still don't have a defense attorney!
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?
W-wait! But the suspect... The suspect is...!
A detective...?
What? Mr. Wright? What does it mean?
Um... Lana? What happened to your hand?
Huh?
W-well, why not? I did drag him all the way here from his office!
Intellectually attracted! Lana was top of her class in school.
I'm doing pretty good in school too, by the way!
B-but, Lana!
You... you were always this way, weren't you? You never think of anyone but yourself.
I know you didn't do it, Lana, I know! So... So how can you say you did!?
If I lose you... I'll be all alone! I... I hate you, Lana!
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.
My sister... She's not always like that you know.
She's changed a lot. She used to be so gentle, always smiling. Everybody liked her.
I don't know for certain myself... I think maybe she... Well, maybe not.
O-Okay!
Looks like they're still investigating...
Hey everyone! Keep up the good work!
Well, they are going to be my coworkers three years from now after all. No harm in saying hello...
P-Pardner?
M-Mr. Marshall!
Strike...?
...
Uh... kind of... sort of... Yeah. He's a detective.
Look! A stylish, glass-walled room! Very nice.
It says "SECURITY." Perhaps it's a cafe?
"Cafe Security"... Yeah, that must be it. Let's check it out later!
... You know, I scored a 97 on my science test the other day!
This is where the cars leave the lot.
What are you talking about? It's plainly an exit!
Ah hah! The theory of relativity!
I've got to write this down. Ah! Hey, hey, Mr. Wright! Maybe you know... Was Mr. Relativity, German? Or was he British?
Look! A door! This must mean something!
No! It won't open! A mysterious lock!
Mr. Wright... You need to learn to enjoy life more.
Ah hah! A ladder.
What's the difference? In scientific terms, please.
Look at the basic nature of things, Mr. Wright.
Here, a phone. Let's see if it works...
... I can't hear anything! My ears! No, my ears! Maybe it's due to the barometric pressure...
Hey!? What did you just say?
This wall is in our way.
Wait! I know! This "wall" is merely a facade, hiding the truth... This is no wall, but a water tank!!!
I-it's heavy! I can't even budge it!
Wait! I know! I'll hide in here and do a stake-out!
What? I'm not suspicious!
W-w-waaaait! What are you doing, Mr. Wright!?
I don't believe it! This is real basic: anything at a crime scene is evidence! Let's be scientific about this, please! Just put it in your pocket.
I'm called to duty already, and at my tender age! Here, I'll teach you the trick to examining evidence in detail, okay?
Okay, okay, now. Look at the Court Record! You have to be sure to examine evidence carefully on all sides! Now. Let's start examining! From every angle!
Oh look! I think there might be a clue there. You should check it out! Press the Examine button.
See? Well? Isn't scientific investigation useful?
Let's be sure to examine every piece of evidence we find!
Well, no time to waste! Let's get hunting for clues! Hmm... I wonder what this is?
C-could you just tell us one thing...? Who owns that car?
Please!
Note to self: look up vittles, saloon, cervesa.
Great! Maybe there are some clues around here, Mr. Wright! Let's check it out!
So this is what the back of the badge looks like! And I always thought it had a safety pin!
You mean you couldn't lend your badge to anyone?
Well that's no fun!
I wonder why they only use numbers for IDs.
Letters, silly! They're the reason we have a written language in the first place!
"Detective: Gruce Goodman, ID: YABADAB" See? Wouldn't that be better?
Exactly my point! Tee-hee!
Us?
Y-you're selling lunches? Here? This is a crime scene!
Oh. Uh, thanks.
Uh... no, but you... You don't exactly look like the type to have clearance.
You know, I'm feeling kind of full. Maybe I'll pass on lunch...
Secrets...?
You mean you're the witness my sister was talking about?
Ahh! I've noticed that defense attorneys have a tendency to want to show people things.
This... this is quite the place.
But, you know Mr. Wright, you could do your office up like this too! All you need is money and a little design sense...
In any case, it looks like the prosecutor is out.
There's a jacket framed on the wall like a painting! The fabric is high-grade cashmere... Italian styling... Silk ruffles, turquoise buttons, and a gold thread collar. I'm guessing it's worth around $5,000.
Speaking of which, your suit would be about...
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, the time until impact with the ground would be... ... Got it! Approximately 3.23 seconds!
Whoa! These are all case files!? They're stacked up to the ceiling! There's even a ladder...
... Splendid, Mr. Wright! What an unusual observation!
Ooh! What a soft and comfy sofa! It makes you want to say, "sofa, so good!"
"Sofa"... "So far"...?
It appears to be made out of bronze with gold plating. It's not worth much. $70 tops.
I wonder what that big "K" means? Mysterious...
Wow! What an amazing bouquet!
And here beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Is the prosecutor in this office named "Wendy"?
What a nice desk! Easy to use, and easy on the eyes! It's polished so high I can see my own reflection.
Oooh! Cute!Â What a pretty tea set!
Amazing! The drawer below is filled with packets of tea leaves! They're all sorted by place of origin and flavor! Look at this Royal blend! What an exquisitely splendid concoction!
Hey, a chessboard!
The Red Knights have surrounded the Blue Pawn...
Those horses are mounted knights. Their swords have really sharp "edges!" And check out that poor pawn, his head is kind of spiky... Kind of reminds me of you.
E-evil ones?
So, she's saying... There was some sort of prosecutor's convention yesterday.
Do you have a personal grievance against prosecutors, or something? Or is there some kind of scientific evidence of this, um, "evil"?
Ew!
R-really!?
Y-you mean you saw the very moment of the crime!?
She... always travels light.
Um... Could we ask you a bit about yourself, Ms. Starr?
Why not make the lunches here rather than import them?
N-no...
Ah... Nevermind... You win.
Y-your boyfriend?
So, to scientifically analyze the data available so far... You, Ms. Starr, are a lunch vendor with an ulterior motive for coming here!
That'd be a sure cause of food poisoning! Scientifically speaking, of course. I mean, now you're talking "Cough-up Queen"!
Wow! It's really crunchy!
This is the kind of room that just screams "I can do the job." Quite a change from your office, really.
Look, look! There's a trophy or something here!
It takes real nerve to display stuff like this. Whoever's office this is, he must be a real stuck-up jerk!
Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! M-M-Mr. Edgeworth!
O-of course! I'm his biggest fan! My sister introduced us once, and...
N-no! Did I...? No! It was just, Mr. Wright here, he...
W-we're just here to investigate a murder case!
A body was found in this nasty, bright red sports car in the parking lot...
Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!? Y-y-y-your car!?
Wow! This jacket is even lacier than his usual ones! This must be his lucky trial jacket!
I'm sure there's a story behind why it's in a frame! Maybe I'll be naughty... and take a picture!
Whoa! These are all case files!? They're stacked up to the ceiling! There's even a ladder...
He must have someone get them for him.
He must study these case reports so closely... He's so cool!
Mr. Edgeworth has such a comfy sofa!
I bet he pours over his case files here until the wee hours of the morning... Then he takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves... And goes to sleep using his arms as a pillow!
I bet in the morning he has sofa hair, and little creases in his cheek from the seams! He's so cool!
It has a big "K" on it.
K-K-K... "King of Prosecutors"!?
"K" stands for "King"?
"King of Prosecutors"... Kind of like "Employee of the Month," only better!
So that's the "King of Prosecutors" shield, huh?
Congratulations! King! Of! Prosecutors!
My, my, my! What an amazing bouquet! Just right for Mr. Edgeworth.
And here beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Wendy? Is she Mr. Edgeworth's fiancee?
What a nice desk! Easy to use, and easy on the eyes! It's polished so well I can see my own reflection.
Maybe I'll take that name plaque as a souvenir.
Hey, a chessboard!
The Red Knights have surrounded the Blue Pawn...
Those horses are mounted knights. Their swords have really sharp "edges!" And check out that poor pawn, his head is kind of spiky... Kind of reminds me of you. Mr. Edgeworth must be an avid chess player! What's wrong, Mr. Wright?
N-no, we don't think you did it! I mean, it was my sister who stabbed him... Uh, wait, no, she didn't do that! I mean...
Y-yes sir! Ema Skye! It, uh... It's nice to meet you again!
You!? Mr. Edgeworth...
But...
That's right, I remember.
M-mistaken!? Why? I mean, I know she's not the warmest person... But I'm sure she felt some responsibility for you!
Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Mr. Edgeworth! Your knife was the murder weapon!?
You have a strange sense of humor, Mr. Wright!
Cleaning day?
Wiping your hands of old cases, in other words.
People like myself and Mr. Edgeworth pride ourselves on our precision, Mr. Wright.
So the murder happened right after you got back.
What? You wanted to be a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth?
M-Mr. Wright!
Are you sure you should be showing that to Mr. Edgeworth?
*sigh* I wish I could be on the same side as Mr. Edgeworth... But then my sister would be found guilty!
Huh? Why's that?
Um, I was wondering something about your shield... Why is it broken?
Oh. Right...
Maybe... we should ask him more about yesterday?
He doesn't like you much, does he, Mr. Wright?
Hey, check it out! There's a metal plate here!
Wow. One guy's listed a bunch of times! "von Karma"... I guess he must be a foreigner?
Well wherever he's from, he must have been an amazing prosecutor! I'd like to meet this Mr. "von Karma" sometime!
The murder took place three minutes after Edgeworth parked his car. If only he was held up at a couple extra lights... he wouldn't have been caught up in this whole affair.
It just goes to show you never know what'll happen when you run a yellow light.
This must be the victim's blood, right?
Hey! Maybe he spends his weekends roughing it in the wild!
Are you kidding? I always pictured him as an outdoorsman!
Mr. Edgeworth's lid isn't on very tight, is it?
L-let's do as he says, Mr. Wright!
L-let's go, Mr. Wright!
L-let's go, Mr. Wright!
L-let's go, Mr. Wright!
Mmm! You must have to brew the leaves a long time to get rich flavor like this!
I knew it! So that's the secret to their aroma! Exquisite!
Whew... We're finally here. Why would they put the detectives so far away from the Prosecutor's Office?
Disturbing! Why does it undulate like that?
Wow, Mr. Wright! You know a lot about the Police Department! Still, he does seem familiar, somehow...
Someone appears to be... dancing with the Blue Badger... Uh oh. He noticed me.
You know, Mr. Wright, I've always thought it was kind of funny... I've never seen anyone who looked like the people in these posters. They hardly even look human!
Uh, I was wondering about that...
N-nice work...
Poor Blue Badger... fated to dance until he drops.
I always get excited when I come to the police station.
It just feels like I've jumped into a movie.
You know, with all the police and criminals.
Sure it is! Look at those two officers over there. They're probably talking about the latest bust!
Just imagine! Right now... Behind those doors...! A police drama in action!
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was wiping tears from his eyes.
The banner here is announcing the "Crime Fighting Campaign."
I wonder if they'll be selling fingerprinting sets.
What family wouldn't want a set at home? It's good for finding out who snuck into the cookie jar.
Mr. Wright! Do you know why patrol cars are painted black and white?
Well, I think they're designed after a panda!
Not that I have scientific proof. It's just a theory.
It was when I was on a school trip! I saw a patrol car and it came to me! We had just been at the zoo, see...
Wh... Why not?
But, what if she's not telling the truth!?
B-but what if the evidence was faked?
Just, please investigate this case carefully, okay? Scientifically!
Huh?
So... what are you doing here, Detective Gumshoe?
Then, what happened? I know things are busy right now... I mean... with my sister's case and all...
None of you?
Um... Isn't there anything else you could be doing?
Officer Marshall...
Hmm... Don't you think it's strange? I mean, why would the victim's ID card be lying on the ground where we found it?
Evidence transferal... Mr. Edgeworth mentioned that too. But... Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office...
But Edgeworth was found innocent!
But... but there's no evidence against him!
I wish had a badge... Even an ID card would be nice...
But, don't you work together with him in Criminal Affairs?
Can you tell us more, Detective Gumshoe?
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
...
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... What could have happened?
Thank you!
Hey, look here! It looks like something's been erased.
Let's see... "Annual bonus: $20." Um... I think a couple zeros are missing.
... Maybe I should rethink my career as an investigator.
Ah, h-hello.
Note to self: jurisdiction squabbles are settled by dueling.
There's something I wanted to ask you!
He's asleep.
Are you ready, Mr. Wright?
Th-thank you, Officer Marshall!
That is odd! Isn't a crime scene supposed to be handled by a detective or higher?
Note to self: police investigations are like settling land. Well, Mr. Wright, what do you say!?
Scientific analysis would suggest this belonged to the victim! I can't think of anyone else it could belong to...
What!? Why not? I mean, don't you want to know whose it is?
Come on! No detective would be that dumb!
Man, what a boring strap!
Here, check out mine. It's a Pink Princess strap! These are hard to come by, you know.
Hmm. The display is still on the redial button.
Um, Mr. Wright? Most phones keep a record of all the calls you've made and received. You just press the blue button to dial the last number you called. Convenient, isn't it? I'm surprised you didn't know about it.
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry! It's just, you never know with people from your generation.
Note to self: a defense attorney doesn't think first, he just pushes the button.
Whose phone is this, anyway? It was on the ground over there...
What? It's my sister's!?
"A Block"... This area is reserved for prosecutors.
I dream of the day when I will be able to park my car here! I'll go over to B Block to buy my hamburgers from you, Mr. Wright.
Quite a luxury car. It just screams "I have money to burn."
This rope... is it...?
... So wait...The victim must have died when the killer closedÂ the trunk on him!
Look! Something's written on it!
There's a name printed on the paper above that... "Goodman."
Well? So? What does it mean, Mr. Wright?
Note to self: for deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright.
So the note was in here...
And? And? what does it mean? Mr. Wright!
Note to self: for deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright.
I can see the Lunchland car over there...far in the distance.
...Â Doesn't that strike you as a little... creepy?
Bruce Goodman... He was a detective, right?
Was my sister involved with the victim in any way?
Nothing in common...?
But, my sister called the victim here on the day of the murder, right? Here... to this parking lot?
But, you're a patrolman now. So how can you be in charge of a crime scene?
That's odd, though. Detective Gumshoe was saying he had nothing to do... nothing important, at least.
So there's no connection between Detective Goodman and my sister!
Officer Marshall!
H-how can you say that! You and my sister, you were...
But rumors are just... rumors, aren't they? These are prosecutors we're talking about! Evidence is everything to them!
What!? My sister...?
Note to self: evildoers are weak against starlight.
Texas...
Note to self: if you encounter suspicious evidence, think of Texas. There's no better way to study than to hang out with the pros!
Officer Marshall, don't you have anything good to say about Mr. Edgeworth?
Hmm... Let me guess... Did it have a "K" for "King of Detectives" on it?
Note to self: the Prosecutor's Office and Criminal Affairs are surprisingly cheap.
A... trot?
My sister's cell phone.
...
What's wrong? You look like I do during finals!
So, well, how are we doing, Mr. Wright?
So... you think we'll be okay?
No problem! I can guarantee that she's not the criminal.
Yes?
What...?
...!
I...I'm sorry!
I... She hung up right away.
Or rather, the whole thing is one big gray area...
I believe in you, sis.
...!
Let's do it, Mr. Wright! I'll be with you the whole way!
Wow... He's much more forceful in person. I suddenly feel like confessing to everything!
Wh-whaaaat!? Ms. Starr was a detective!?
I-it's merely a flesh wound, Mr. Wright!
Ms. Starr... do you have something personal against prosecutors?
Note to self: the judge had to think before replying.
So... she was in B Block when she witnessed the crime.
I bet you stink, too.
Let's just do what we can! Even if we don't have any proof, we can always complain!*
I believe I've heard that tag line elsewhere... you could cry plagiarism?
Mr. Wright! Are you going to just sit there and take that kind of abuse!?
M-Mr. Wright! You can't just let him walk all over you! Th-that's just sad!
Good advice. I'm not sure I understood it, but... good advice.
Mr. Wright! Are you going to just sit there and take that kind of abuse!?
M-Mr. Wright! You can't just let him walk all over you! Th-that's just sad!
Good advice. I'm not sure I understood it, but... good advice.
I-it's only a flesh wound, Mr. Wright! We can make it!
Scientifically speaking... Ms. Starr's testimony... is flawless.
Wh-what do we do!? Is this it? Is my sister guilty!?
D-don't smile like that!
Great show, Mr. Wright! My sister's as good as free!
So, if I order pizza, does that mean I'm planning to kill the delivery boy?
Note to self: Mr. Edgeworth's sighs smell like citrus fruit.
Mr. Wright, you should speak up if you have an objection, you know!
What a hunk! He's my hero, really.
Mr. Wright! This is our chance!!!
The short wick burns out the fastest! It's a scientific fact!
...Â Obviously, more scientific testing is required!
In the end, Mr. Edgeworth prevails!
The most important part...?
Note to self: Attorney Wright gets bitten by snake.
It would have taken her a little time to climb over the fence. So she couldn't have gotten to my sister THAT fast...
Ms. Starr... is acting strangely. First she mistakes a scarf for splattered blood... And now she says she didn't see any scarf!
...? What is it, Mr. Wright?
Th-that's right! It doesn't make any sense that she would run from behind the partition to the oil drums!
Excellent! More mysteries!
I'm sorry my sister is so suspicious, Mr. Wright...
But she didn't do it! You have to believe me!
Um, Mr. Wright... I hate to bother you while you're celebrating your victory... But why would Ms. Starr lie like that?
Why would she say that my sister had tried to use the phone, but failed? It doesn't make any sense! Why lie about something so insignificant?
I mean, maybe she really did see her try to use the emergency phone.
Um, Mr. Wright... I hate to bother you while you're celebrating your victory... But... why would anyone use the emergency phone before the murder?
Your cavalier attitude stands in stark contrast to your feeble argument, Mr. Wright.
Um, Mr. Wright? Doesn't this strike you as odd? Why did Ms. Starr lie? It doesn't make sense!
She could have just said she saw the crime from the security guard station. It wouldn't change anything!
Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!
Mr. Wright! You have to do something!
Mr. Wright! No evidence can win against the raw power of caviar! It's a scientific fact! The only thing that's left... Is your strong presence and deft powers of deduction!
Let's screw the lid back on those overpriced fish eggs!
We did it! We screwed that can shut, Mr. Wright!
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
This blood... It's my sister's, right?
Poor Sis...
AAAH! There's blood here too!
All this blood... It's horrible!
Actually, if you combine all the various blood tests, there are millions of types! It's practically impossible to narrow a blood sample down to one person! Or so I hear.
Mr. Wright! Do you or don't you have a problem with this shoe!?
C'mon, Mr. Wright, I know you can find something! Some kind of off-the-cuff contradiction!
Mr. Wright, let's be scientific about this! Examine the evidence!
Mr. Wright, let's be scientific about this! Examine the evidence!
There's nothing sly about a lawyer using the law as a weapon! In any case, science is always on our side! Don't forget! Scientific investigation is the wave of the future!
Great going, Mr. Wright! But... It's true that the lack of a footprint is a contradiction... But then we have to ask why there wasn't a footprint!
Think, Mr. Wright, think!
What!?
So my sister's blood on the shoe... That's when it happened?
M-Mr. Wright! Do something! Please!
B-but...
But Angel Starr is on the prosecution's side! She could have been lying about the water!
Huh...? M-me?
W-well, yeah, you are! You're saying my sister hid evidence by erasing the bloody footprints!
M-Mr. Wright, wait! Look at the asphalt in this photo!
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I guess I... I couldn't help after all.
Open your eyes, Mr. Wright! Think scientifically!
That cloth was found in the car's "muffler," right...? Muffler... muffler... Where have I heard that word recently? Muffler...
Um... Mr. Wright?
Are trials... always like this with you? Like you're swimming up from the bottom of a lake, about to reach the surface... But no matter how hard you paddle you never seem to get there...
Apparently she got called off to the judge's chambers.
So! This is where we turn this trial around, right? Our only weapon, a tiny, insignificant piece of cloth!
Officer Marshall!
Um... Officer Marshall? The whole "muffler" thing didn't have anything to do with scarves... She wasn't even wearing a scarf!
...?
What!?
So, Ms. Starr wasn't mistaken...
So... what are we swimming in now, Mr. Wright?
I wonder what happened to Mr. Edgeworth?
Hey! The temperature rose 5.7 degrees when that man came in!
Udgey... seems to be his nickname for the judge...?
My sister's muffler!
This is the first time I've seen Mr. Edgeworth at a loss for words...
Come on! Just hurry up and open it!
There's a small tag on this knife.
What does that mean?
But... it's strange.
I'm not certain... But I get the feeling I've seen this somewhere before! Letters like this... or letters that looked a lot like this... somehow.
There's a small tag on the knife.
What's that supposed to mean?
That's weird.
I don't remember where... but I think I've seen something like this before. Something similar to what's written on this tag. It wasn't that long ago either...
Waaaah! D-don't scare me like that!
Look at this knife blade... the tip is broken off.
The chances of that are really slim. Scientifically speaking, of course.
Hard to think there isn't a connection there!
Maybe there's something about the knife that will give us a clue! Let's examine that knife while we can, Wrighto!
The evidence room... Didn't he mention that in his testimony just now?
You seem happy, Mr. Wright!
This is just my gut feeling... but I'd say there's a 0.001% chance of that happening!
Who would have guessed?
Detective Goodman who was killed in the underground parking lot was homicide, too!
Except that the serial killing happened simultaneously, scientifically speaking.
Hmm... 5842189...
Mr. Wright! Don't listen to them! Look at the Court Record, scientifically!
And that knife! What was it doing there...?
Mr. Wright! Where have we heard that name before? Wait... Ah hah!
Honestly, I'm not sure if that officer was capable of making the connection... He did seem... challenged.
Well, Mr. Wright?
Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
Uh... um, Mr. Wright! So... What's going on with the case, anyway!? I... I'm a little confused.
What's this "and the evidence room" part!? The Prosecutor's Office and the Police Department are 30 minutes apart by car.
... Alright! Let's do it!
Don't be so sure, Mr. Wright.
Would you mind coming with me? I'll prove that these thick- rimmed glasses of mine aren't just for show! Let's go! Science awaits us!
You know, I really don't think we should worry about the Police Department murder! There wasn't even a body found there! Who cares?
And my sister would never do such a thing! I know it...
My sister, erasing evidence at the crime scene? Never!
That's not it at all! It's just... We're both professionals at what we do... and I trust her!
He he heh. Ignore the strength of my science at your own peril, Mr. Wright!
This situation calls for one thing, and that is... Luminol testing fluid!
Blood is sticky stuff, you know. You can't just wash it away with a little water. Even if you can't see it, it's still there...
Never trust anyone's eyes but your own, Mr. Wright! Just give it a try!
I'm a minor! I can't even drink yet!
Here, look, I'll lend you these glasses.
To test for a blood reaction, just spray the luminol on it. Like this, see? Touch the screen to spray it on. Okay! Let's find us some bloodstains!
Uhhhh... It's so... ugh!
It's just... this is my first time seeing real blood!
O-okay, well, we definitely know that this is a bloodstain. But, doesn't something strike you as odd? Scientifically speaking, of course?
H-huh? Why is that "elementary"? I mean, I would think that if there was a fight, you'd expect some bloodstains here.
C'mon, Mr. Wright! We're all counting on you!
I definitely think so! I mean... Look at all the blood on the sole of the victim's shoe!
Uh, h-hey, Mr. Wright! See how I'm marking up the floor plans when we find a blood stain? See... I'm pretty handy to have around, right?
I saved up my allowance to buy this!
We can't be sure that the police will reveal all their evidence in court. Sometimes they fail to mention evidence that doesn't fit with their view of the case.
Yeah! It feels like we're really investigating a crime now, doesn't it?
Ms. Starr!
So that's where Ms. Starr saw the incident from.
Well, this is just something I heard... But apparently he went out to buy coffee for Ms. Starr.
So, this is the famous divider.
The great divider! A chip off the old parking block!
Well, no time like the present! I'll try to kick it over myself! Hii-yah! ......
That's about as red as a sports car can get.
So, what model car is it?
Those are car types, Mr. Wright. Not models. You're a guy, aren't you, Mr. Wright? Your supposed to know these things!
That's where we found that note.
A case that was due for transferal the day of the murder.
I wonder what kind of case this SL-9 Incident thing was?
So... Ms. Starr climbed over this fence!?
Well no time like the present! I think I'll give it a little try! Eeeek! ......
Back when you were the Cough-up Queen, right?
Mr. Edgeworth would have been the suspect!
Um... What do you think about this?
Really?
In other words... five minutes after the crime?
The five minutes weren't the problem, Ms. Starr, you lying was the problem!
Mmm! You must have to brew the leaves a long time to get rich flavor like this!
I knew it! So that's the secret to their aroma! Exquisite!
Well, you never know where something might go down!
No! My sister isn't the murderer!
...
Hey! Just whose side are you on!?
Oh, I tried studying one of those just now. Remember what they were talking about in the trial today...?
Well, when I tried reading it made my head hurt.
Then, when I closed it, it slipped out of my hand and fell on my foot.
Oh, I watered him just now. I mixed in a lot, too.
Why my very own scientific additive! Well, Charley? You like it?
Uh oh! I have a history test coming up next week! I'd better study! I'm borrowing this desk, okay? Let's see... George Washington was the first king of America...
He looks wimpy, but you can tell, there's a sharp edge under that facade. That bellboy is going to be someone someday.
Oh, well, isn't it obvious? We should begin with that, y'know... that thing.
Oh, well, you see...
Uh... I'm not being very useful here, am I...
Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
There was that business with him not reading that officer's report...
That number was the clincher, wasn't it!
The ID number of the detective killed at the Police Department that day at 5:15. But... we found this card in the parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office.
Don't leave me here to do all the thinking alone!
I bet you'd be pretty happy with a "King of Attorneys" shield, too, huh?
Still... I wonder why the trophy shield is broken?
So... Mr. Edgeworth's knife was the murder weapon.
Ugh... You know, all of this is that Angel Starr's fault!
Well, no, but she must have seen it wrong!
B-but...! She hung up right away. And it was a bad connection. I couldn't hear anything.
She did say something about a "muffler"... but got cut off...
Th-this photograph... Ms. Starr must have been seeing things!
It's evidence from an old case, right?
This stuff is pretty expensive.
I'd say about $10 per gram! I save up my allowance to buy it.
Yes. We don't have parents...
Sometimes she even gives me a bottle instead of my allowance!
I hope the detectives aren't yelling at her... "How did you kill him in two places at the same time!" Can you imagine?
Let's come back later!
Don't scare the poor guy!
Well, this place is certainly tidy today.
I'm sure he's off doing important investigations!
...?
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, the speed at the time of impact would be... ... Got it! Approximately 70.71 miles per hour!
He won such a prestigious award. Why would he just leave it on the couch?
Really? Hey, I should write this down. Tell me what he was like as a kid!
That doesn't exactly sound like typical elementary school stuff.
Kind of gets under your skin, doesn't it?
What? It looks like some blood has dripped down here!
A nosebleed, hm? Maybe in his wrath, Mr. Edgeworth slapped someone for their incompetence.
The detectives are running around so fast they're blurring.
So... the evidence room. The scene of the crime! According to the pamphlet we got at the front desk... Here it is!
Ooh, a real crime scene! Let's go take a look!
The Blue Badger is still writhing around today.
Can I take out his batteries? I just can't help but feel he's going to do something naughty!
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was showing the detective where his head was.
Well, there was a vicious murder of a detective in this department, after all.
Ugh... It makes my head hurt.
Yes, you sound "dead"-set on investigating! But don't mess up, or we could wind up... dead!
The design's a little changed from the one outside...
You have it trademarked?
According to the pamphlet, this is the guard station for the evidence room.
It sure seems that way... Oh. Ohhh...
It's those cacti! They're so prickly... so imposing! It's hard to think straight.
I have a feeling I know who this guard is already...
There's a security guard uniform hanging there.
A leather jacket, leather pants, a leather... What was that called again? A punchy? A paunchy? A pinchy? I know! A poochy! Hmm... Wait, maybe that wasn't it.
Yipes, that sure is prickly. It must be the real deal.
This cactus... is a lot like my sister, actually.
Encased in a cold, rigid shell, with thorns pointing in every direction... Just like her.
... It's more an attitude thing than a physical similarity.
There's a light blinking below the monitor. It says "Recording"! I bet we could use this computer to check on who went in and out of here!
This swinging door makes the place look like some kind of saloon!
Of course not! If you went in through here.. The cactus would fall over. Ouch!
Look, on the floor, a lasso!
A trap, here? Wait, I know! Maybe someone was trying to catch a wild bull in here... But the lasso missed!
Let's just walk in! ... It won't open.
Wow! We got a reaction!
... I think that might be more painful than being murdered.
Oh, we know.
Sorry? You lied on the witness stand! That's unforgivable!
Ah...
...!
So... you were a detective, weren't you, Ms. Starr?
Oh, and here I had thought someone had gotten food poisoning from your lunches.
Disposable?
So... they didn't solve it?
Wh-what? You mean they executed someone with fabricated evidence!?
And... you were one of those?
Wait! Th-those lunches you sell...
There has to be a connection!
Um, Ms. Starr...? Officer Marshall... is he your... uh, are you his...? Are you g-g-g-going out!?
I was just wondering what happened to him? A long time ago, when he was helping my sister do cases, he was so nice. He got along so well with my sister, it made me jealous. And... he was nice to me too, back then.
But now... now he's so cold!
I... I see. Thank you.
Um...! Y-you, and Officer M-Marshall, you... uh... A-a-a-a-are y-you... Are you going out!?
Thank you.
Wow, my mouth is watering! I can almost hear the sound of steak frying on the grill!
No, I'm sure it's delicious! Ms. Starr poured her heart into making this!
She must mean "beef." She probably just wrote it generically.
Of course, as a scientist I have to check what additives she used.
Huh? It says here... "Hours of sweat and labor."
Huh? Wasn't that...
Oh... you mean one of these? Actually, it's not for sale...
W-wait! Don't leave!
He ran off to the evidence room...
... That wasn't a salute... it was an eye test!
Still, I do feel better about things. A little. I mean, they caught the person who stabbed Detective Goodman, didn't they?
Wh-what was that!?
Wait, I know who you are...
Officer Meekins! So you're a guard here at the detention center?
Oh, I get it. You're here to deliver a report?
What...!? Whaaaaaaaaat!?
No comments from the peanut gallery!
So, normally there's a guard at the evidence room?
So what happened then?
Um, might I ask... what happened to your hand?
Yet another similarity between this case and the one at the Prosecutor's Office...
So, if he was a total stranger, why did you stab him?
Well, that sounds pretty much by the book so far.
What...!?
Wh-what happened then?
Don't you think you should just confess?
What!?
Hmm... That's some story.
So, Officer Meekins, why was it that they arrested you?
Let's look at what we know. Now, Officer Meekins didn't know Detective Goodman... And the "victim" whom he met at the scene of the crime didn't show his ID card.
And if this "body" just "disappeared" from the evidence room... We don't even know if anyone actually died!
Huh? But you still ended up here...?
Huh? Video tape...?
...
And you wait until now to tell us this!?
M-me? Why would I...?
Hmph.
Um... do you think you could take a look at this?
That's what!?
This... ID card?
On second thought, you don't have to look at the knife.
The day that Detective Goodman's body was found in the trunk...
He's passing the buck, Mr. Wright.
H-hey, Mr. Wright! Look who's standing at the Head Detective's desk!
Why are you saluting him, Mr. Wright!?
Uh... what exactly did the Chief of Police want you to do?
So, nothing belonging to Detective Goodman is still here?
What!? You kept something!?
A lost item? Did Detective Goodman lose something?
Sounds like an inquisition...!
Wh-what!?
Scientifically speaking, it's impossible!
Ah, he was the one you were picking on earlier?
Let's see if we can kind of discreetly ask him.
It just goes to show, you never know until you ask!
Huh... hey! This is a detective's ID card, isn't it?
Y-yessir! It's an honor!
The guy who can't sit still... does he mean Detective Gumshoe?
Heh heh! It looks pretty cool on my lapel, doesn't it? Just think, a real ID!
Yes, sir! Because, sir, we get to go into the evidence room now, sir!
And we have the ID card from Chief Gant! Let's just walk in! ... It won't open.
What is that security guard thinking?
Um... we're here to investigate the crime scene.
Y-yeehaw?
A leather jacket, leather pants, and a leather...
Ah hah! A poncho! It sure looks cool, but the name is a little silly.
This cactus sure is prickly. It must be real.
Billy, you're wearing your cowboy hat on your hand.
You sure have a lot of monitors in here!
Which monitor shows the section where the crime took place?
Unless you're the security guard responsible!
Look at this swinging door! Just like a wild west saloon!
I think Officer Marshall really wanted to be a wild west bartender.
Look, on the floor, it's a lasso.
What!?
And I have the ID card! A real ID card!
Um, I was wondering if we could talk to you...
What was that all about, Mr. Wright?
You're just saying that because his stomach was growling! You have no idea what he was talking about either!
Officer Marshall, you're in charge of security for the evidence room, right?
So... what were you doing around 5:15 when the murder took place?
Note: he was riding down the highway on his horse named "Zippy."
Ms. Starr told us something... She said that you were a detective until two years ago.
You're still investigating the SL-9 Incident with Ms. Starr, aren't you?
What kind of case was it, anyway? We've heard the name so many times, but no one tells us what actually happened.
O-only two of them? There must be a dozen!
And Officer Meekins and Detective Goodman, are they on one of those tapes?
Hey! I've seen that somewhere before!
Huh?
Mr. Wright! I saw a number on that record just now! I've seen that number before!
I see now...
See this? This is the victim's ID card.
Officer Marshall! Show us the ID number on that ID card record! Look, the fourth number! It's a perfect match!
So, when the incident occurred, Detective Goodman was in the evidence room!
So, Officer Marshall... You're from Texas?
Uh, yeah, Ms. Starr...
What? What's wrong?
I don't see. I wonder what it means?
He's willing to talk!
Um... this is neither "Wild" nor "West" here...
... I... guess so? Huh? I'm lost.
So this is the evidence room? It really is kind of like a graveyard.
N-nice try, M-Mr. Wright. Y-you can't scare me! Eeeeeeek!
S-sorry, I thought you were a ghost!
Oh, so that's what you were talking about...
Boss for a day...
That's the door we just came in through.
I wonder what would happen if Officer Marshall cut the power while we were inside?
Wow! Look at this big pile of junk in the corner!
There's a pair of handcuffs attached to the frame.
Hey, that's one of those human profiles for range testing.
Better him than us.
Looks like a shirt. I guess it must be evidence for some case.
How do you know?
Sounds like Detective Gumshoe leaves evidence hanging out a lot, too.
This place is stuffed with evidence... stuffed with dreams.
Mmph! It won't open.
What a sorry looking fishing pole that is.
It's a little worn... but there's definitely a handprint here!
Mr. Wright! What if there are other bloodstains left in the room!?
Wow, someone must have broken something big to make all these pieces.
"The" case?
We can check it out later.
You want to try to put it back together?
That's why I always carry around a tube of glue!
Maybe some of the pieces are missing? Let's just try to put as many of the pieces in place as we can!
H-huh? Well, I think we did it. But some of the pieces are missing.
Were some pieces stolen?
I kind of understand how it got broken.
There are two things that bother me. One: why are some of the pieces missing? Two: doesn't it seem a little unstable!? No wonder it broke!
Look, this one's open! And there's a indicator tag stuck on it still!
Are you sure it's okay to leave it open like that?
Someone left a glove here... but only one.
What is a saw and paint doing here?
True art...? I noticed that there's blue and yellow paint here.
So, Detective Gumshoe, you're boss for the day?
But, if you're boss... why are you all alone!? Where are your underlings?
"Only you can open"...?
So... Mr. Edgeworth is with the inquiry committee now, right?
That sounds like a lot.
"Right hand"...? Oh! You mean, your fingerprint?
Funny, they look like normal lockers...
The handles?
Bzzzap! You get a shock!
And this was two years ago?
Huh? What do you mean?
So, so... That switchblade knife...
I wish had a badge... Even an ID card would be nice...
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
...
Art...?
16... that's how old I am now! I wonder what happened?
Wh-what is it?
What...?
What... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Note: the Police Department lacks faith in its lock system.
...! Why am I getting a reaction here?
What, this? It's called "Luminol Testing Fluid"!
Huh?
I always buy it by mail order.
I knew it! This is someone's right handprint!
It's yours?
What? But you're a detective!
This proves that something really happened in front of this locker.
You know, I never did care for the word, "tag." It's confusing.
Do you know how many other words sound like it? "Bag," "Gag," "Nag," "Lag," "Xag"...
Do you challenge me...?
Hey, look here! It's hard to make out, but there's a dark red stain here.
Do you think Detective Goodman's blood somehow got on it when he was stabbed?
Huh? This thing doesn't have a bottom!
I wonder which side is "up"?
... At least it doesn't collect dust inside, right?
R-report? You mean the note written on the back of that flyer?
You'd better tidy it up or it will get wrinkled!
This place is stuffed with evidence... stuffed with dreams.
Mmph! It won't open.
A pile of junk lies battered, worn and forsaken!
They cast a withering gaze in our direction that screams, "dust me!"
Detective Goodman's evidence locker. It's empty.
So, the person who took out this knife had to have been Detective Goodman.
That yellow crime scene tape! You know, yesterday was my first time seeing that! It was always my dream to push through the crowd and just step over the tape! It's a little daunting to encounter it again so soon!
There's blue and yellow paint here. This is all I'd need to paint a portrait of you, Mr. Wright!
There, standing by the window, a teacup in his hand!
Mr. Edgeworth... you're back from the District Prosecutor's Office inquiry?
Really? Was it helpful?
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... I think this whole thing is really taking a toll on him.
"Concealing evidence"...?
The Police Department!
Wow, you get nervous, too, Mr. Edgeworth?
W-why, Mr. Edgeworth?
The Chief of Police...?
Can I ask what kind of case it was?
Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth just told you "no" in a very polite manner!
What's that got to do with anything?
Hm. That makes it seem all the more suspicious. Who knows? This might turn out to be the clue that breaks the case!
M-my sister? What?
Huh? Y-yes! Of course! Why, just today Mr. Wright and I were using this...
Aluminum powder for taking fingerprints!
F-for me? Are you sure? We are the "enemy" you know.
Well, let's get going! One last investigation!
Here, in this blood on the detective's evidence locker.
Right. Let's get started! First... choose a finger.
Each finger leaves behind a slightly different imprint. So let's choose the finger that will have left behind the clearest print!
Quit procrastinating and choose a finger!
Okay. Now it's time to check for prints! Let me show you how it's done.
First, we sprinkle the aluminum powder around.
Just touch the screen... See?
The aluminum powder adheres completely to the print. Once the powder is well spread... just blow away the excess.
You just blow With your breath. Imagine you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. See?
It's fine! It won't go up your nose or anything. You just pour the powder on thick, and blow away the extra! Those are the basics of fingerprinting, Mr. Wright!
Aha! You did it! You found one!
Hmm... now that you mention it, I guess it doesn't...
It think it means... we're out of luck.
The person who left this handprint must have worn gloves.
Hey, calm down. That's just the way it goes sometimes with scientific investigations. But... it does seem a shame. While we're at it, why don't we look for other prints?
Looking at the locker door again closely...
it seems like there are fingerprints outside the bloody handprint as well. Let's see if we can find a clear print!
Yay! A print so clear it's dazzling!
Anyway, this print took a lot of effort to find. Let's match it up right away!
Well, there's no point in finding a fingerprint... and not knowing who the owner is, right?
Look at the fingerprint data we got from Mr. Edgeworth... and point out the person you think left these prints!
I could make a pretty good guess. The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. So, whose fingerprints would we most likely find on this evidence locker?
Hmm... no match.
Isn't it obvious? The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. They most likely belong to the owner of this evidence locker.
S-something wrong?
Mr. Wright! I was doing this for your benefit, so you'd learn!
Ah hah! So these prints belonged to Detective Gumshoe!
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You gave me this "so what?" look.
Okay, so we came up with nothing this time, but there's always next time! Sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss! You gotta roll with the punches, Mr. Wright!
Right! There was a handprint here! Okay! Want to try using this?
What!?Â Why not!? Try my patience any longer and I'll dump this powder over your head!
That's the spirit! Oh! But I have to warn you about something first.
The area with the blood was wiped away, right?
Any prints in that area will have been wiped away too.
Would you say the probability of your hypothesis is high?
Anyway... We must try to find prints that weren't wiped away.
That kind of result won't be any good for matching prints, will it?
Ok, let's try a different finger, then!
Whose are they? Whose!? Is it someone I know?
Huh? O-Officer Jake Marshall!?
Th-that's got to be a coincidence! He's not involved in the crime!
...!
Oh... Oh!!!
But why would Officer Marshall...
...!
I... I don't believe it!
Okay, let's move on to a different finger!
So, what do you think, Mr. Wright?
Lana!
So, how'd it go?
A plea bargain? What do you mean by that?
But Lana! Don't tell me you...
In order to defend my sister, you're going to accuse Mr. Marshall?
Yes, and the body eventually reappeared in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car.
Now that's what sets Mr. Edgeworth apart. He sounds so on top of things... even though he doesn't know what's going on himself!
You can't fault him for a lack of enthusiasm.
Maybe if you'd just kept your cool your hand wouldn't be...
This is what he was telling us yesterday.
Right! Let's press him for all he's worth!
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
But he's the one pointing his finger...
But he's the one pointing his finger...
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
But he's the one pointing his finger...
But he's the one pointing his finger...
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
But he's the one pointing his finger...
But he's the one pointing his finger...
Mr. Wright! Let's check the Court Record again!
But if you ask me, I think there's a problem with what's shown on the tape... rather than with the actual tape itself.
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
But he's the one pointing his finger...
But he's the one pointing his finger...
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
But he's the one pointing his finger...
But he's the one pointing his finger...
The real thing's so much more intense than in the movies! Here, you can use the player to watch it as much as you'd like.
Huh? Oh, um... Maybe something, like, jammed the electronic system?
Yeah, I thought so too! There's got to be another clue somewhere in this footage!
Instead of being sarcastic, why don't you think this through again?
Just hearing that makes my hair stand on end!
Couldn't he just use his right hand for that...?
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... It must be so difficult for him...
Mr. Wright! What do you think?
What?
You're thinking too hard about it. Come on, let's show them what we've got!
Mr. Wright! You have to do something, or else Lana...
But Mr. Wright! If you don't do anything...
Don't give up, Mr. Wright! Get up and fight!
Mr. Wright... Do you mean...
Mr. Wright! Don't you remember what you said this morning!? You know, about your "trump card"?
Lana... You're the one who knows everything!
You always know everything! Why don't you just tell us!? Mr. Wright is trying his hardest to protect you!
How can you be so cold... Don't you trust us? Don't you trust... me?
...
But Lana! That's...
What? My name's in there!? I don't know... Unless... No, it couldn't be... Lana! This "SL-9 Incident"... Is that...
The... Joe Darke... No... No, Lana! That's over with! No!!!
Y-your Honor! Wait!
The defense has an objection. A scientific objection! Right?
Please, Your Honor. All I'm asking is for a minute of your time! Please hear me out! Mr. Edgeworth, please...
I... I was kind of in shock. I mean, finding out that the SL-9 incident referred to the Joe Darke Killings!
But that's when I figured it out. I mean, what Officer Marshall was trying to do that day... So I knew his fingerprint had nothing to do with the crime. That left only one thing... the other handprint!
No, but I figured if I examined it scientifically... I'd be sure to find a clue! So I ran over there and looked at it again!
Um... No!
Sorry. I guess I'm not much of a scientific investigator after all.
...
Please don't be mad. I'm just a high school student!
But Mr. Wright! Those traces of blood are the only clue we have! If we can't find something wrong with them... Please, Mr. Wright. You're a professional. If anyone can save Lana, it's you!
Mr. Wright! I'm sorry I can't be of more use... But still! If you can't find anything wrong with that blood mark, Lana will be...
Just calm down, Mr. Wright. Try and remember what the evidence room was like on the day of the crime!
Mr. Wright! Think it through scientifically!
On that afternoon... Officer Meekins was the one who brought the Blue Badger to the evidence room, right? After he put it down, it would be impossible to leave a handprint on that locker.
The first crime took place before the Blue Badger was brought to the room, right? Say... When was the Blue Badger brought there, anyway?
L-Lana...
But Lana!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wright. I'm sorry for what my sister said...
I... didn't know. I never knew that the "SL-9 Incident" was just another name for... the "Joe Darke Killings."
Lana wanted Darke convicted so badly! That's why she used me... That's why she used what happened to me.
It's all there in the file... Joe Darke's last victim was Prosecutor Neil Marshall. When he murdered Officer Marshall's brother, he left behind an incriminating piece of evidence.
On the night Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered, Joe Darke... tried to kill me.
Officer Marshall's brother... Neil... was only trying to save me.
Yes. I was a witness in the Joe Darke trial.
Oh, I tried studying one of those just now. Remember what they were talking about in the trial yesterday...?
Well, when I tried reading it made my head hurt.
Then, when I closed it, it slipped out of my hand and fell on my foot.
Uh oh! I have a math test coming up next week! I'd better study! I'm borrowing this desk, okay?
Mr. Goodman didn't have this on the day of the crime, right?
I never would have thought Officer Marshall the type to do something like that.
The traces of blood on its sole. There wasn't any blood found at the Prosecutor's Office's underground parking lot.
In the evidence room at the Police Department. Now stop using me as your memo pad!!!
There's only one number left to check out.
Sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven...
Mr. Edgeworth is so kind, giving us something like this. Hey! You don't think he... he... likes me, do you? ...
Mr. Wright! Hurry! RUN!!! AHH-CHOOOO!!!
... Here, I'll wipe those fingerprints off your face.
Yes. He said it didn't have anything to do with the crime.
Hey, don't ask me! I'm not the one making the decisions around here!
It looks like it's about to break apart!
I meant again...
This is somehow related to that other incident...
I guess that blood wasn't Mr. Goodman's after all.
So there wasn't a murder at the Police Department at 5:15 in the end.
We owe our entire success in court today to this tape.
I counted a total of five clues in it.
What was it labeled, again? The "SL-9 Incident"?
I'm not sure I want to know everything...
Looks like they're questioning Lana again.
Well, since we've come all this way, why don't we go see Mr. Meekins?
Everyone's probably busy looking into what exactly went down in the evidence room. That must be where the detectives are.
Yeah. I thought we were finally making some headway in our case!
Hang in there, Lana...
So, this is the famous divider.
The great divider! A chip off the old parking block!
That's about as red as a sports car can get.
So, what model car is it?
Those are car types, Mr. Wright. Not models. You're a guy, aren't you, Mr. Wright? Your supposed to know these things!
That's where we found that note.
A case that was due for transferal the day of the murder. I never knew... The "SL-9 Incident" referred to...
Mr. Edgeworth isn't here.
Yeah, withÂ Lana admitting to falsifying evidence two years ago...
My, my, my! What an amazing bouquet! Just right for Mr. Edgeworth.
And beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Was this the same message that was here yesterday?
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, your chance of fatality would be... ... Got it! 99.9998 percent!
Oh, Mr. Marshall!
Billy...?
But Mr. Marshall... Why did you do it?
The Blue Badger is still writhing around today.
Can I take out his batteries? I just can't help but feel he's going to do something naughty!
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was just listening to how his friend messed up.
A question...?
The "scars" that the SL-9 Incident left behind...
How old was he... your brother?
The day the SL-9 Incident took place, that wasn't the same day as...
Who are you talking about!?
?
Tell me... what happened to my sister!
Mr. Marshall! Could you please have a look at this?
Things seem kinda quiet around here today.
Why don't we go look for some other people to talk to?
It happened two years ago... It was right about this time of the year, too. There was a terrible thunder storm that day... Unusual for the season. I was alone in my sister's office. We were planning to eat dinner together once she finished her work. Then suddenly... This terrifying man came bursting into the office!
It seemed like he was running from someone. He pulled out a knife and screamed at me. I didn't know what was going on. Just then, Prosecutor Marshall showed up.
Joe Darke tried to take me hostage, but before he could... Mr. Marshall tackled him. Then...
I-I'll never forget it! Lightning struck, and the lights went out. Suddenly... a bolt of lightning flashed outside the window, lighting up the office for an instant. What I saw then burned a permanent picture in my mind. I... I can still see it now...
I don't remember the moment when Darke stabbed Mr. Marshall.
The Prosecutor's Office wanted that guilty verdict so badly. Lana forged the evidence, and Mr. Edgeworth used it...
Yes. But I'm sure he didn't know anything about it! He couldn't have known he was being given false evidence. Even so... that's when it all started. The rumors about Mr. Edgeworth, I mean. It's all my fault... If I could have just testified properly, none of this would have happened!
After that case ended, Lana was never the same. She became cold, like she is today.
... Darke knocked down Mr. Marshall and raised his knife.
I don't remember what happened after that. Apparently I passed out. When I came to, Lana was cradling me in her arms.
I-I couldn't bring myself to testify about that instant. I tried, but the words just wouldn't come out. I drew a picture, but it wasn't any good.
Once it was all over... I made up my mind. I decided that when I grew up, I'd become a scientific investigator. I want to be able to fight crime with my testimonies! And find the evidence to make an airtight case... That way, Lana would never have to forge any.
What is it?
That's right.
Oh, there's no mystery there. Joe Darke had been taken in for questioning that day.
Of course. This happened at the Police Department. He tried to run away halfway through the interview, and fled into my sister's office.
Because the detective offices and the questioning room are right across from the elevator.
No, silly! Didn't I tell you? Two years ago... Lana was a detective. She was the best in the entire force!
After the Joe Darke case, she was transferred to the Prosecutor's Office and made Chief Prosecutor.
L-Lana...
But Lana! If you're wrong... an innocent person might be found guilty!
Lana...
That trial... it really wasn't "fair," was it?
I believed in you, Lana! I believed that no matter what happened, you'd always stick to the truth!
Tell me it's not true, Lana! What the witness... Ms. Starr said! About you stabbing Mr. Goodman with a knife!
Lana! I don't understand! Why won't you tell us?
She was amazing! They still talk about all the cases she and Chief Gant cracked together!
They were the best team ever! They solved crimes before the reports could even be filed!
to gain experience investigating crime scenes, so you could later use that experience in court.
Prosecutor Marshall was trying to save me from Darke...
That's where he found me.
W-what are you saying?
But that case was solved two years ago!
I guess he wasn't convinced with the ruling against Joe Darke.
That must mean everyone's busy solving crimes.
Um, sir? We'd like to have a look around for Chief Gant's office.
Really? You mean, it's okay for us to go in there? I mean, we aren't police officers or anything.
Well, what are wating for? Let's head to the Chief's office!
In the Chief's office, silly! At least, that's what it said on the door.
Hey, I used to take organ lessons in kindergarten! They used to call me "Little Miss Bach." I thought I was a genius until they tried teaching me notes. I never could remember where C was...
Oh... But this office... it was a crime scene two years ago, wasn't it?
Looks like we aren't welcome.
What do you mean?
You mean like, a clue!?
From sitting so long in the meeting?
Is it because of what my sister said?
Yikes...
...
Are there really so many people who hate him?
Me...
Well? What was it?
Maybe we should show him the murder weapon. It might jog his memory!
With his car? So... it was an accident?
An animal...
But no one actually witnessed him using it to murder anyone, right?
You don't have to take a good look to notice that.
Where was it?
That's pretty... conclusive.
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
It would have saved us a lot of trouble if he hadn't guarded it so well.
On the day Detective Goodman was murdered, this suddenly disappeared from the locker, and was found in Mr. Edgeworth's car muffler.
Well, what is it, Detective? Quick! Before you forget again!
Wow! Is that a new type? I've never seen that bottle before. "Add three inches to your base height."
Uh, well... It's not quite the same thing as luminol.
Yeah, Mr. Edgeworth gave it to us.
Very impressive, detective! You knew what is was right off the bat!
"Master"... That has such a cool ring to it!
Wow, a higher power...
Hey, wasn't your locker the one with the blood on it, Detective?
You know Officer Marshall?
Really?
Note to self: Detective Gumshoe talks to a cactus...
You're looking into the case for Mr. Edgeworth?
The Chief's out now, and his office is locked, but we'd like to have a look around if that's okay.
What? Really!?
Breach of trust...?
How about this ID card? It was Detective Goodman's...
Oh.
I wonder if there's something we could show him that would make him change his mind...
There he is! It looks like he's writing something.
Cheer up, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm rooting for you!
He won such a prestigious award. Why would he just leave it on the couch?
...
This is the "King of Prosecutors" award, right?
I saw something today that looked like this, somewhere...
Yeah, only different. What was it...?
Come on, Mr. Wright! Let's take a look!
Just distract him. I'll check it out.
What!? "Letter of r-r-r-r..."
But Mr. Edgeworth! None of it is your fault!
Mr. Wright! Please, you have to do something!
Mr. Edgeworth...
But Mr. Edgeworth! You can't just walk out on the trial...
Say, we just saw a picture taken around that time.
Because you were awarded this?
Take something back?
Oh yeah. Chief Gant asked you to hold onto that, didn't he?
Oh, I see! So the "chipped shield" and the "broken knife" symbolize...
Wow. Thanks, Mr. Edgeworth! I learned something new today!
What? You wanted to be a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth?
That makes me kind of mad. Actually, something's been troubling me about this shield. Look... Do you notice anything different?
Yeah, don't you remember? The other shield in the Court Record?
To take evidence from a case solved six months ago back to the Prosecutor's Office...
Chief Gant gave this to you that day, didn't he? He asked you to bring it here from the Police Department...
Speaking of that, there's something that bothers me.
The trophy Mr. Marshall is holding... it's a little different than yours.
A story?
But Mr. Edgeworth! You were only doing your job!
Mr. Wright! Please, you have to do something!
Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth just told you "no" in a very stylish manner!
"Due to recent events I hereby announce my resignation as public prosecutor."
Wow! Even when resigning, Mr. Edgeworth is cool and concise! Still, it wasn't his fault...
Yeah, but that responsibility means nothing if he just quits!
To truly take responsibility you should have to work the rest of your life for no pay.
My sister...?
Lana... and Chief Gant!
But you didn't have proof anything illegal was done...
!
Lana always wanted to be a prosecutor.
Huh?
They solved all kinds of cases together, didn't they?
! Really?
Mr. Marshall...
Ms. Starr...
...
Chief...
B-but how could he control Lana?
Ms. Starr...
You're a "DJ" as well?
... Oh, that DJ...
?
There's got to be something we can do to make the Detective change his mind.
Say, this design's based on an old Chinese parable, right?
No, but this one sounds more exciting!
Mr. Edgeworth really feels responsible.
Detective...
But...
they wouldn't let you off the hook with another lost item report!
Detective Gumshoe isn't very photogenic, is he?
Look, his eyes are half shut!
Hey! Each of his shirt buttons is off a notch!
Here goes, Mr. Wright.
Open sesame. If anyone finds us now,
EEEEEEEEK!
Sorry, I thought you were a ghost.
You really do want to get fired, don't you?
Note to Self: Detective Gumshoe has a lot of dreams...
Don't say that!
Hey! This is when Lana and I went to that theme park... ...
This was taken on that day two years ago.
Lana's always been a meticulous cleaner.
What's so bad about that? Music soothes the soul!
But aren't the Chief's ears affected?
This mark looks like some kind of flower.
Now that you mention it, it does look all pointy and kind of painful.
So sharp dressers don't need to wear badges?
It looks like a code needs to be entered in this panel to open it.
A seven-digit number... Didn't we see one of those somewhere?
I guess that wasn't it.
Maybe we should check the Court Record again!
What number did you enter!?
What?
Say... Anyone care to look inside?
Look! It's a... a...
There's something else in here too.
This is a handprint, isn't it?
Uh... I don't think so.
Is that it? This is all that was in the safe?
Come on! There's got to be something we can show the detective!
Wow! Look at the size of Chief Gant's desk!
Hey, look at the case name!
I knew it! The Chief must be hiding something about that case!
Wow! Look at the size of Chief Gant's desk!
Mr. Edgeworth had the other half of that list!
What? You mean we're paying for this!? That's it. I'm not paying one cent of my taxes!
Even if he did, he'd never be able to get back out.
You can see pretty far from 15 stories up. If you were to drop that suit of armor from here...
Really? Why didn't he?
Oh.
Yes. That's where I was waiting for Lana... on that day two years ago.
So ever since Lana left, no one ever touches that desk?
What!? Yeah, Mr. Wright! What do we think of him?
Not only that, but it was wrapped in Lana's scarf.
That's a great idea, Detective!
...
... Um, it's not your fingerprints we want to take.
Okay, Mr. Wright. Let's check for prints! Sprinkle the powder on the cloth, then, once they've been absorbed into the prints, blow the rest away!
That kind of result won't be any good for matching prints, will it?
Ok, let's try a different finger, then!
No, that doesn't match.
Yeah... But it was inside the Chief's safe.
So that means it's got to have something to do with that incident!
Hey, you found a match? Whose fingerprints were they!?
Oh... That's too bad. I thought they'd be Darke's prints.
You would stare at it?
Hey, there it is! Right there in that picture, see?
Wasn't this jar a piece of evidence from that case?
Yes, that one... that was in the safe.
Sixteen... That's the same age I am. I wonder what happened?
Well, if we don't do it now, then let's at least do it later!
Mr. Wright! Here's some glue!
What? But it has to!
If you don't, I'll switch your eyedrops with my special solution!
!
But...
There's a reddish line on it!
But it only raises another question: What was a piece of it doing in the Chief's safe?
That's what the Chief was reading before, isn't it? You know, when we first came in here?
So Mr. Edgeworth's list really was only half of the whole thing!
Note to Self: Detective Gumshoe is going senile.
Don't be so negative, Detective! We do want you to share your information, though.
Argh! Got... to stay... positive!
Whoa! This area must have been covered in blood!
It must be. When Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered. Two years have passed, so the reaction's kind of dull.
Hey, look here! It's hard to make out, but there's a dark red stain here.
This piece the Chief has is different, though. The blood stains on the other pieces are just spots, but this one's a line!
What is it? Did you find something?
Why are your eyes moving about like that, Mr. Wright?
This is a handprint, right?
Mr. Wright, think about it scientifically!
A more likely explanation is... the person slipped and fell on a freshly waxed floor, getting wax all over their hand.
It happens, you know. I always slip on the floors at school after they're waxed.
EEEEEEEK!
Y-yes sir! Sorry...
M-me, sir!?
But sir! I'm not a licensed scientific investigator yet!
M-Mr. Wright!!!
Um... M-my name is Ema. Ema Skye. My occupation? I'm Lana's little sister, and I want to be a scientific investigator!
Yes. I'm trying my hardest to forget about that, though...
I was waiting in my sister's office that day.
I passed out... I don't remember much.
I was waiting in my sister's office that day.
Yes. She was second in command under Chief Detective Gant. My sister... She was the best detective ever!
That's right. I'd always sit at my sister's desk, and dream about playing that organ. I wanted to play it that day, too...
Lana promised to take me to dinner after she finished her work.
A man came running in, and took me hostage.
Yes, Joe Darke. He was a... a serial killer.
There was a lot of noise coming from outside, so I... opened up the door to have a look. That's when I saw... Him.
Neil Marshall rescued me,
When Darke grabbed me, I... I thought I was as good as dead.
I... I don't clearly remember what happened then. But...
but I'll never forget what I saw that instant!
Mr. Marshall jumped on Darke. Just then... the lights went out.
It was just about this time of year... There was a terrible storm going on, and lightning struck nearby.
Right, but just then lightning flashed again outside. That sudden flash left an unforgettable image of the scene in my mind...
I told the detective about what I saw then.
Yes. Detective Goodman. He was in charge of the case.
The man...
Yes. That's what's so scary about this trial.
Yes, but... at the time, the words just wouldn't come out. That's why I drew a picture.
The man...
Y-yes, Your Honor.
I drew a picture of that scene once... but it seems to have been lost.
Yes. I wanted to do everything I could to help the investigation. I can still see it now... Whenever I close my eyes...
B-but I did draw it! I swear! I'm not just imagining it...
The man...
The man raised up his knife, and... and stabbed Mr. Marshall in the chest...!
Even now when I close my eyes, I can still see it just as clearly.
When lightning struck and the lights went out, Mr. Marshall jumped on Darke. I was thrown aside and the two began wrestling each other.
I'm pretty sure I was watching them.
Hey! That's it! That's the picture I drew!
That was handed to Detective Goodman in the questioning room?
...
...Huh? Oh, Y-yes sir, Your Honor!
This is the picture I drew two years ago.
This is the picture I drew two years ago.
Um... I think I drew it two or three days later. At first I was in such a state of shock that I couldn't do anything...
The flash of lightning was so bright all I could see were shadows.
No... I couldn't see him clearly. The lightning was so bright... and I was knocked to the floor.
Darke had a tight grip on me, but when Mr. Marshall jumped on him, I was knocked away. I turned around, and that's when the lightning flashed.
After that I must have fainted.
No. I-I'm sorry...
Anyway, this picture...
This picture shows exactly what I saw that instant!
Of course! This is the exact scene!
I drew this picture before I heard anything from the detectives, so I don't think anyone's story would have influenced me...
What? B-but, I still remember it just like it was yesterday!
... Mr. Wright... How could you... *sniff*
But Mr. Wright, look at the evidence! See the murder weapon? Its tip is broken too!
It was the conclusive piece of evidence that proved Joe Darke was the murderer!
I... I'm not lying... The man really was holding up a broken knife!
... I knew it. You really don't believe me...
Mr. Wright...
That's... a broken knife!
Wait! I... I remember now... I remember everything!
Mr. Edgeworth!
Could you show me your evidence list again, please?
... I knew it... This picture... I'm the one who drew it.
That's right. The list wasn't torn in half at the time I drew this picture. All this time I've been trying so hard to forget... I must have locked this part away deep inside me...
Yes, Your Honor.
When I saw that man raise his knife...
When I saw that man raise his knife...
Yes... at least, I think it was him.
All I could really see were shadows.
I panicked, and rushed toward both of them.
What else could I have done!? He was about to stab Mr. Marshall!
Well, I didn't know that at the time! When that Darke guy knocked me down, all I could think was, "I've got to help Mr. Marshall!"
I think I... I knocked away the man with the knife.
It... it all happened so fast... And I was in shock! I don't remember everything clearly. What I did... it's all kind of a blur...
I saw the man about to stab the other person, who I thought was Mr. Marshall. I knew I had to stop the man with the knife.
Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!
Of course! See? I even drew a picture of him here!
I know it sounds strange. I was surprised too when I saw him at the Police Department. I had this nagging feeling that I'd seen him before somewhere. Now I finally remember!
He wasn't in the room, but I'm sure I saw his shadow!
That's right... but I still remember it. He had three creepy horns...
...
But I know what I saw! I'm not making this up! Mr. Wright, please! You've got to believe me...
Mr. Wright...!
But Mr. Wright! That doesn't look anything like the Blue Badger!
Come on, Mr. Wright! You can do it!
A-AHHHHHH...
You mean... Mr. Marshall died... because of... me...? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
Yeah. When I came to, I was in the medical office. I've been listening to the trial from the gallery.
No, don't be. It was the truth. You know, it's funny. I almost feel somehow... relieved.
Yeah... Now I finally know what really happened. To think that all this time... my sister was being blackmailed by that terrible man! And she did it all... just to protect me.
It was all my fault. It's all because I... I murdered Mr. Marshall.
Chief Gant may be able to fool everyone else with his "forgery," but he can't fool my memory. I remember now. I knocked Mr. Marshall into that armor.
No. I'm going with you.
I want to be there... when Lana tells the truth.
Lana! No matter what happens, I'll always be your sister!
But Lana...!
Please, Mr. Wright. You've got to help her! She's sacrificing herself because of me...
She's not. I know my own sister. Whenever she speaks stiffly like that, she's hiding something inside. Deep down, she's really screaming in agony!
Lana...
All just to protect me...
...
Apparently the jar shattered at the time the crime was committed. But I have a feeling there is more to it than that.
She's lying! She did it so I wouldn't be blamed for what happened!
Mr. Wright! My sister's lying!
There's no way she could have done it alone!
She didn't think Darke was the real murderer. That's why she tried to erase the "real evidence."
Lana... you'd do that for me?
Lana...
Even I carry my a bottle of emergency Luminol wherever I go!
I'm so sorry, Lana. I didn't know... I've treated you so badly all this time...
More contradictions have surfaced in her testimony.
...!
Please, Sis! Stop trying to protect the Chief! I... I can't watch you suffer any more for my sake...
So you do tell foul lies then, Mr. Wright?
B-but, I do remember knocking over Mr. Marshall...
Lana must have known... See. Mr. Wright? She really does have faith in you!
Lana said she gave it to you this morning, right?
Let's check that evidence again! There must be a picture in there somewhere!
Oh... Oh my... This is... the actual crime scene...!
*gasp* Mr. Wright! That piece cut out from his vest! Could that be...
It's... a handprint.
That cloth... It had fingerprints on it! Whosever fingerprints those are must be the real murderer!
Why are your lips turning all purple, Mr. Wright?
All right! The time's finally come to show it to them! Those prints have got to be the Chief's!
Why not? You know which item to show!
What!? They're mine...? So I really did do it...
Mr. Wright! Why don't you show them? We found it together!
So you really were manipulating her!
What are you waiting for, Mr. Wright?
Mr. Wright! This is your only chance!
Come on, Mr. Wright! You remember that thing with the murderer's handprint on it, don't you?
M-Mr. Wright... Do you really know?
What!? They're mine...!?
But why... Why didn't you tell me!?
But that's not fair...!
...
No, that's not it. Just now, after the trial ended...
You know, I did my best too. But... Lana didn't say a single word to me.
...
Oh... Are you here because of my sister again?
Me...?
Lana!
It's okay, Sis. Don't worry about it.
...!
Sis...
...
But Sis! You were only doing it for me...
Huh?
Sis...
But Sis! You don't have to apologize! I'm happy now!
Of course! You know, Sis, I always knew that one day you'd come back. And now you have!
Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Mr. Edgeworth...
Come on, Mr. Wright! Show him what Lana's talking about!
That's the picture I drew!
Mr. Edgeworth...
Okay. I'll come visit you!
"Scientific Investigation"...
Thanks, Sis! I will!
But...
Way to go, Detective! I didn't know you had a wild side!
Thank you, Mr. Wright! You're the best!
Yeah, that's a great idea! Come on, guys! Let's go!!!
Thanks for coming to see me off! I can't believe I'm going to Europe. Thank you, Mr. Wright! Thank you so much for everything!!! I'm a little sad, but I'll be all right! Whenever I want to see Lana, all I have to do is open this book...

Hey, it's you! That Wright kid.
Call me Ema. There's no need for titles once you've shared a bottle of fingerprinting powder!
...Isn't it obvious? I'm snacking. You think I want to be here!? Me, in charge of security in this pit!?
There's no knowing with that glimmerous fop. Apparently, he's all upset because something was stolen. He wanted security back here during the concert. Where does he get off acting like he's some big rock star?
Hey! You listening to me?
This one? That's Lamiroir's dressing room. Don't even think of going in there unless you want a piece of Snackoos in your face!
MUNCH MUNCH... oh, MUNCH, that's the Blue MUNCH Badger.
Serves me MUNCH right MUNCH for going MUNCH out MUNCH of MUNCH my MUNCH way MUNCH
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Hah! If you think you're going to pull me away from my snacks just to hear you mumbling... ...on and on about whatever, you're going to be sorely disappointed!
Don't even think about taking that!
Put so much as a hand on the door and I'll Snackoo you.
Don't play smart with me!
I'll have some tea.
I'll have tea!
I'll take a tea.
They're plastered all over the place. It's annoying.
Why? Everyone here is already here! Why advertise to them?
Do you have to find fault with everything I say?
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
If you even think about going in there, I'll--
......
You, out of my way!
Lamiroir! Lamiroir!
It's not locked... I'm going in!
LeTouse! Oh no... Hey, you!
Watch this room for me. I have to call for backup!
And don't touch anything! I'll be right back!
What's wrong?
Huh? No...
The concert's been cancelled. Backup's on its way. Is Mr. LeTouse... ...He's dead, isn't he? That's terrible.
I don't need some rock 'n' rolling prosecutor to tell me that.
I'm on it already!
Oh, it's you. I figured you'd come.
You're attorneys, no? Shouldn't you wait until you have a client...?
...G-Glare at me all you want, you'll get no snacks from me.
Hmph. Oh well, I suppose. You did find the body with me.
Just try not to touch anything!
"Maybe that's how the killer escaped." ...That's what you were thinking, right?
When we arrived on the scene, the killer had already fled. He or she must have had a way out. And that air vent is one possibility.
You're not going to say, "Can I have it, please," are you?
Look you may be a cute little girl of fifteen... ...but that doesn't get you any special treatment with me!
It's not about envy! It's about tampering with evidence!
You need to learn to respect your elders a little!
No way! If you want one that bad, get your daddy to buy it for you!
Leave it to Mr. Wright...
From the look of it, the victim was shot once in the shoulder. The first shot must have missed.
The murder weapon is a 45-caliber revolver. It's very powerful. I believe what we're seeing here... ...is the mark left by the second bullet after it passed through his shoulder!
Absolutely not!
Look, you're not the only one eyeing that fruit here.
Right!
But she tempted me! She's a... She's a temptress!
I'm less worried about the stepladder, and more worried about why it's there.
I'm just about sick of seeing those, personally. Maybe I'll tear it down! Ha ha!
Hmph. Maybe there's something else I can tear to shreds...
Ah, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.
It pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.
You'll be wanting for a long time on your salary, junior. Wait till you're as famous as Mr. Wright was, then dream.
Not sure I approve. It'd be better if this flower was a bit more... Oh.
It's fine! Fine! I'll just put it back, see?
A permanent dryer. Want me to curl those bangs of yours?
Sure is. The victim, no less. Let's take a closer look.
Will you two stop bickering and get over here!?
Hey! No touching!
Hmm. You raise a good point. ...I'm a bit intrigued by this scene. Let's take a look.
Certainly a possibility...
I wonder what it could mean?
Well, you're practically a detective there, Apollo.
You are in a dressing room. Hmm... This must be makeup. ...I've never heard of most of these brands.
Maybe they're Borginian?
Probably not a good idea. You never know what you might find in one of these boxes. Bombs, razors, ransom notes... It could be anything.
That's right. A big 45-caliber revolver.
Why are you giving me that look!? I didn't do it!
Listen, I was out in the hall eating Snackoos when it happened!
It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.
Heh, you want me to tell you? It's the size of the barrel. Simply put, the larger the caliber, the bigger the round. ...The bullet, in other words. Bigger bullets do more damage.
You know it!
...... Hush. Kids shouldn't ask so many questions.
Not to mention it only opens a crack.
You could peek into the room through it, though, you know.
Mr. "Romein LeTouse", wasn't it? He was Lamiroir's manager. And interpreter, apparently. This was his first time in the country.
It doesn't seem likely. Nor can I think of anyone with a motive to murder him. ...Except for one person, of course.
I said nothing. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
We've sent a request to the Borginian Embassy for more info on him.
Well, you and I know more about the crime than anyone.
Well, we know the crime took place during the concert.
......
What do you think about this revolver?
That's right. It's a 45-caliber. That makes it one of the deadliest revolvers around. Even the police don't carry guns this big.
Yeah. It doesn't make sense... You don't need so much power to kill at such close range. ...It's overkill.
There's another thing about a gun this big. It puts a lot of strain on the shooter.
Yeah. Say, if you were to fire this revolver... ...the recoil would probably dislocate your shoulder.
Yet, the killer used this revolver, and quite well. I'm guessing whoever did it was used to shooting.
You always carry that around, do you? ...Just like Mr. Wright.
It's good to never let yourself forget who you are. I'm proud of you. Keep up the good work.
It's been fired twice. You can still smell the gunpowder... ...That's odd.
Hmm? Oh, nothing.
It's just, something about this revolver seems... strange.
Hmm, sorry. I can't comment on anything not scientifically relevant. I am a forensic scientist after all.
Well, that's about it. I think we've looked at just about everything there is.
I know how you're feeling. It is hard to know when to stop. But anything more involved has to wait until the squad gets here.
I'll go report the evidence. Sorry, but could you wait here till I get back?
Great! Thanks!
Ah, it's you. ...Where were you!?
You bet something's wrong! The impossible's happened! Arrgh! It's all your fault, you know!
Well it's gone! Utterly gone!
The body, stupid! What else?
Mr. LeTouse's body has disappeared!
How can you just stand there!? We have to start the investi...
...!
This hasn't been a good day for guitars or geeters.
Well, this sure is a... what did he call it? A sausage? No wait, it was a pickle. And it's your pickle! I told you to stay in the room!
...It's alright. Top priority now is finding that body. ...You can make it up to me later. Ten bags or so of chocolate Snackoos should do the trick nicely.
Just hold it right there. This is not time to be waving a bag of Snackoos in my face!
Look. What's important is that Mr. LeTouse's body is missing! And we've got to find it!
Ema Skye, I'm a detective for the police department. I was on security detail at the concert forum that night.
Some security I was. Couldn't even stop a murder... ......
......
...Alright.
The night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.
The night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.
That's right.
My thoughts exactly. But, orders are orders. Even when they come from rock gods.
Well I can't! What do you mean "time on their hands"!?
Only people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.
I didn't know about that! I certainly didn't invite you.
Some other hangers-on tried to get backstage, but I drove them off.
And then...
At the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.
You were the one chatting. I was eating Snackoos.
Hey, I'm the one being cross-examined here! Here, this'll keep you quiet!
We were right...MUNCH...there. Hard to be mistaken about that...MUNCH.
...... *gulp* Right, so after that... ...me and Mr. Lawyer there opened the dressing room door.
I went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.
Blaring, yes.
They pipe sound from the stage into the backstage through speakers. That way people in the back can hear when they're supposed to be on stage.
When we walked in the room... ...the band was playing "Guilty Love", I believe. Making it easy to determine the time of the crime.
Anyway, I closed off the scene and started my investigation.
I examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.
As I said, it was clear from the circumstances. Listen... We know there was only one exit from the room: that door. The small window only opened a tiny crack. And I was standing in front of that door. So, how could the killer have fled the scene? There's only one possibility: the air vent.
Exactly.
There's certainly no way you could get through. Nor me. The only one who could fit through... was a child.
Remember, access to those rooms was limited. Only those involved with the concert were allowed.
And... there is another vital piece of evidence.
Marks were found on the air vent grill. Traces that it had recently been opened.
And something else was found, quite clearly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.
I felt nothing.
Watch this room for me. I have to call for backup!
What's wrong?
Huh? No...
Don't ask me!
...Hmph. I believe I was saying that the only way Mr. LeTouse's killer could have escaped... ...was through that air vent on the ceiling.
That air vent isn't very big, see. Kind of limits the people who could possibly get through.
You sure would. Not that you would have been there in the first place, though. Remember, the whole backstage area was off-limits to people not involved with the concert. The only one who meets the conditions for our killer... is the defendant.
I believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.
I believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.
I didn't believe it myself. But it can't just be a coincidence.
What? You want me to sing it?
Fine, fine! Er, ahem. Let's look at the first part of the lyrics, shall we? "When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight."
Next, we go to the right page of the lyrics sheet. Where we find... "Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away." As we know, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. "Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away. All away." Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet.
He's right. ...Scientifically speaking.
Ah, er, ahem! Anyway, the shooter...
He moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.
You want my scientific opinion? "No clue." But, he clearly had a reason to go through all that trouble. Some deep reason.
The diva's complaints aside, I can't imagine someone doing this on "just a whim".
Yes. This crime was planned for sure.
No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.
I looked into that, I assure you.
...It was his first time in the country, it seems. Apparently, he learned English on his own.
Unless our famous prosecutor did it as a publicity stunt.
I was just kidding! Don't get all worked up, glimmer-boy.
And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.
The bullet holes in the wall, of course.
The revolver was fired twice. One shot missed, and left a hole in the wall.
That dressing room isn't exactly spacious. Picture the shooter facing off with the victim in there. They can't have been more than five feet apart. It would be difficult, almost impossible to miss at that range.
Very. Assuming the shooter could properly aim.
It's the only explanation that makes sense. He used sound and other senses to fire the gun... ...poorly.
You got it.
......
Right.
That's right. Allow me to explain it... scientifically. The murder weapon was fired twice. The shot that missed left a hole in the wall. Furthermore, there was no more than five feet between shooter and victim. Hard to miss at that distance.
He would have had to use sound and other senses to aim... ...and miss.
Which makes it very likely that the shooter was blind.
Ahh! Nothing like a scientific explanation to get the blood pumping!
All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.
Please, none of those non-scientific objections. They're bad for my complexion.
Lyrics can be explained scientifically! ...Never underestimate the power of science!
...... I require more data.
From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.
...I wouldn't call it "proof", per se.
Recall the crime scene, if you would. There was a stepladder below the air vent. As it happens, maintenance was scheduled for that day. Custodial staff went around checking all the air vents.
Everyone backstage was told about the maintenance. ...Including Machi Tobaye. He would have known that there would be a way out at the top of that stepladder.
Maybe you should just accept it and move on?
A scientific conclusion based on a thorough examination of the crime scene, yes.
Wh-What!?
The smeared blood stains...!
It's almost as if he wrote something...?
The victim wrote the killer's name... ...It's certainly a logical conclusion.
......
What's your point?
Well, Mr. LeTouse was writing something in blood. Once the killer saw what it was... ...Wait.
I said... they were blind. Ack!!!
Ah... ahh...
Urk... Immmmmmmmposssssibbleee!
Wh-What?
Huh...?
What are you saying? Of course he's blind!
H-He's the blind pianist, right? So... So he's... Doesn't Lamiroir lead him around by the hand all the time?
What...?
But what about the bullet holes in the wall?
You... You jerk! Just what was I in here for? Comic relief!?
Whatever! I'm not leaving! I can't leave like this. I'll come up with some clue to solving this case if it kills me!
Ah! Ah ha!
This blood stain... The criminal tried to wipe it off, right?
We might be able to find out what was really written here!
That's right, with this! It's called Luminol! Maybe you know of it? It's a chemical that reacts to blood.
Hah! As if I'm going to tell you!
Right! Go for it, Apollo!
You just have to spray the luminol on it! Simple!
Right, ready? It's easy as pie! Just touch the screen to spray an area. Here! Give it a try!
It says... "IPXX314206"... ...Is that the killer's name?
I-Interpol? You mean the international police agency?
Eh?
Oh, wait, I know... What if Machi Tobaye's really an undercover Interpol agent?
...You had me until that last bit.
Well, sure... Why did Machi pretend he couldn't see?
How could he know!?
Lamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!
Ah! Aaaaaaaaaaa... Really!?
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Lamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!

Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the "landscape painter in sound" or something?
!
...What are you doing here?
Oh, am I supposed to be happy? You give me the second degree in court, and Prosecutor Gavin makes me look like a fool.
My department chief had a field day with that one. "Even a blind person could see the shooter wasn't blind!" Funny guy, huh?
I suppose. Maybe that's why the chief gave me these after he was finished chewing me out. Said it was my reward.
...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...
Be my guest. You're not going to find any clues in here. ...Though I did find something strange.
Can't a girl frown anymore? Is that a crime?
Machi Tobaye's fingerprints are on that air vent. Why would his fingerprints be there if he wasn't the shooter?
Hey! Wipe that frown off your face. One stick in the mud per crime scene, please.
"Loony mall"? What's "Loony mall"!? It's "Luminol"! Get it right!
I met my embarrassment quota for the year, that's for sure.
Um, how?
It just bugs me to think that little kid outsmarted me. And it makes him even more suspicious now that we know he can see! He could have seen the air duct, and he could have shot that revolver.
You mean her saying she heard Detective Daryan's voice at the scene? Hmm...
Why can't we have a normal, straightforward killing once in a while in this country!?
Was that true what you said in court today? You know, about the case... About how everything was happening according to those song lyrics?
It is kind of hard to chalk it up to coincidence, hmm.
You think the same person did all of this?
Neither did I! I couldn't fit through that air vent anyway.
It's so little I must have passed over it yesterday. I found it under the sofa.
Part of some device, I think. I haven't a clue what. The bit sticking out from the end looked familiar, so I had it examined. Turns out it's an antenna.
Like on a cell phone. This device must use an electronic signal of some sort.
...What are you trying to do, burn me alive!?
Says you! You weren't the one holding it!
Let me see that for a second. ......
Well, this is definitely a little transmitter. The signal's weak, probably only reaches thirty feet.
Incidentally, if you look at a cross-section diagram of the stage area... ...Let's see, thirty feet from Lamiroir's dressing room... That covers the backstage completely. It also looks like it would cover the stage.
You know, you're a bit like Mr. Wright. He always carried his badge around, too.
I think he did it so he'd never forget who he was, or his duty as a defender. Something like that. Pretty noble, really.
Why did they have to commit their crime according to the song? Seems like it'd be more trouble than it's worth.
That's certainly possible. But risky, don't you think? Just carrying someone as big as Mr. LeTouse would be tough enough.
That's an Interpol-issue revolver, right?
Sounds that way.
......
Hmm. A small device... Looks like a transmitter.
You press this switch here and it sends out a signal. No idea what it's for, though.
Hmm. A small device... Looks like a transmitter.

Oh, this?
...... Yeeeeeeeeeeoooooooooouch!
What's the big idea!?
Well, now we know what this is: an igniter.
It nearly lit me up, that's for sure!
I suppose. At least, we're getting somewhere with this case.
What! You aren't trying to burn me up again, are you? Who sent you to get me? Who?
Promise!? No promise is good enough with you still carrying that weapon around! Try burning me again with that trigger of yours... ...and I'll throw 100 bags worth of Snackoos at you!
...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...
...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...
...Guess I'd best be getting on with my investigation.
I feel better just knowing what this thing is now. I'll have to look into igniters a bit more later.
...Oh, it's you. You came at a good time.
Either of you know where Lamiroir is?
Yeah? That's strange...
I can't find her anywhere. I was supposed to bring her to the prosecutor's office...
It's hard to imagine her wandering off somewhere on her own. ...Being that she's blind and all.
Great! Thanks.
Ah, you. We all owe you a big "thanks", that's for sure.
Yes. She came to a short while ago. You found her before it was too late.
Someone attacked her. ...She was struck on the forehead.
We don't know.
Right. Would you like to see her now?
She wants to thank you for saving her life.
Ah, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.

I see... What made the case?
It was just a theory... If Acro really was the killer, I thought this was the only way it could end. Especially if "he" was the defense attorney...
Of course... Well Detective, my plane is about to leave. Do me a favor and try not to be too harsh on Acro. Once I get back, I'll make a stop by the Chief Prosecutor's office.

At last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!
So you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!
Hey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!
I didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...
Detective! Come over here for a second!
...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.
Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!
Wh-What...!?
... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.
This isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!
I'm getting sick of dealing with one foolish idiot after another...
You can't seem to stop allying yourself with the enemy, can you? I don't need a traitor in my midst.
I do. Scruffy. You have thirty minutes to get out of here. You are no longer needed. Good bye.
Quiet! If it weren't for traitors like you...
...! Wh-Who!?
... ... ... Y... You... How dare you show your face to me without a shred of shame upon it!? You've soiled the Von Karma name and dragged it through the mud. Run away with your tail between your legs like the ill-bred dog you are!
Y-You!
Keep your assumptions to yourself! I... I haven't given in yet! I won't lose! This case is mine! I'll never hand it over to you! Never! Mr. Phoenix Wright! I will see you tomorrow... In court. It will be a clinical lesson on the meaning of "total victory"!
"I will defeat you this time!" the instant she saw me.
What are you doing here!?
You've got some nerve, following me around...
...Me? Following after Scruffy...? Don't make me laugh. I'll show you something interesting... little girl.
An electromagnetic receiver. I planted a tracking device on that detective. And with this, I know that fool's every move.
Now then... Let's stop wasting time. Adrian Andrews!
Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?
Adrian Andrews!
Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?
Go back to your room.
... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright?
I was shot in front of the courthouse, in my right shoulder. Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning.
But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor. He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.
...!
I don't know what you mean.
Hmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal?
... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over.
That isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means.
...
And what does that have to do with me?
... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all.
... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me.

You see now, don't you... Mr. Phoenix Wright? This is exactly why you should NEVER take your eyes off of that scruffy fool!
You should know better than to ask that, Mr. Miles Edgeworth. A Von Karma is perfect in every way! The evidence is here in perfect condition! Don't worry about Scruffy. He's fine, and his injuries are minor. All of the items are inside this.
I apologize for its ugliness, but there was nothing else to wrap the items in.
These pieces of evidence are items left by De Killer during his escape from the police.
Yes, Your Honor. De Killer left three pieces of evidence.
The first item is a pistol.
We have yet to perform a ballistics test, so I can't say anything for certain... However, I believe it has something to do with this case... At least, to me.
That's what I believe, yes.
I kept the bullet they removed from my shoulder as a sort of memento... I'm sure it will be an excellent sample for the test.
The second piece of evidence is this video tape.
Unfortunately, there was no time to.
But I would speculate that this tape is very important.
Because he came back to his hideout for it.
That's right. It looks like he was trying to recover it. He injured three of the officers at the site.
But somehow, it looks like they managed to protect it from De Killer. Shelly de Killer is no ordinary man.
The last piece of evidence is this bellboy's uniform.
I am almost certain it was. There's even a pair of black leather gloves in one of the pockets.
There is one thing I found interesting about this uniform.
There is a button missing on this uniform.
It's a very unique button. I'm sure if we were to recover it... It would provide us with an interesting clue.
...Hmph.
That is all I have to present, Your Honor.
... Well, I was just shot, so...
... Well, I was just shot, so...
... Well, I was just shot, so...
...
Why are you still smiling... Mr. Phoenix Wright!? You... You lost!! Your perfect win record has now been crushed! And yet... You are still happy!?
How dare you!?
Hmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!
Wh-What foolish nonsense...
Wh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?
You pathetic fool!
I don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over... It's all over!
...! How did you know I was here...?
That's...
Hmph. That's just like you. I only planted it there because he was always wearing it. This... filthy, drab coat of his... I don't know how it ended up in my luggage. But it's going in the trash, I promise you that.
Four items...?
He put it in here...? ... It doesn't matter anymore. The case is already over.
... That's none of your business.
Shut up! You don't understand a thing! You can't possibly understand what it means to be "Manfred von Karma's daughter"!
So many expectations from everyone around me... Expectations I must fulfill! I'm expected to win no matter what. And failure? Such a thing is not an option for me! My father was a genius. There's no doubt about that! But... But me... I'm no genius. I've always known that.
But I... I had to be one. I had to.
...! No, I'm not... Not anymore. I've even thrown my whip away.
...
... You haven't changed a bit... You've always... You've always left me alone and walked on ahead without me. Miles Edgeworth... I've always hated you.
And then... Finally, my chance to take my revenge on you arrived. If I could win against that man... If I could make Phoenix Wright bow down in defeat... Then this "girl" you left behind would have risen higher than you! That was supposed to be my "revenge"...
... You know, I can't do it... I can't change who I am. I can't throw away everything I've been until today.
Adrian Andrews...?
Hmph!
...!
... I... I... I am Franziska von Karma. Don't think I'm going to walk in your shadow forever... Our battle... begins now... so you had better prepare yourself, Miles Edgeworth!

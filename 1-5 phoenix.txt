It's been two months since Maya left the office... Two months without a single trial. I've had offers... But none I took. That is... until the day that girl showed up.
(Why do I come here to the office every day? It's not like I want to work...)
... ... Um... who are you?
...
...
I'm sorry, but Ms. Mia Fey no longer... works here.
I'm Phoenix Wright... A defense attorney.
Um, yes, that's correct. (It wasn't Edgeworth who was murdered, though...)
I'm sorry... I'm afraid I'm not taking cases right now.
Look, I'm not accepting any new cases. I'm sorry, but you'll have to try elsewhere.
But...
...!
(Maya...? Could it be...?)
... Okay. I'll hear you out.
(Scientific investigator?)
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.
Mia's plant, "Charley." I've been taking care of him in Maya's absence.
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases. I ought to at least dust it off once in a while.
There's a poster of the Steel Samurai on the wall. Maya stuck it up here on the day that she left. I didn't have the heart to take it down.
I do sometimes get strange looks from the clients, though.
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. Egads! The bellboy was staring right at me.
Ema, was it? So you're a "scientific investigator"?
No, it's just, you seem kind of, er, jumpy. Or maybe just... young?
Oh, I see... wait! Only sixteen!?
Um, so what exactly is your current position, then?
(Great, another future professional in training...)
So what's this about a case? You said the trial's tomorrow?
So... it's a murder case.
And... there's a witness.
Right... I suppose I will.
(That's interesting... How would she know Mia?)
So, you want to be a scientific investigator when you grow up, then?
Still, it's good to have a goal. Albeit a very unusual one.
Uh, yeah. (Sure can't fault her for a lack of enthusiasm.)
Your sister...?
I'm looking forward to it. (Guess I should get down to the Detention Center and talk to her sister.)
(So she went to the same school as Mia.)
Um, incidentally, Mia is a woman.
Well, it's nice of you to help your sister out like this. You must be close.
?
(Huh?)
Your only family? What about your parents?
Oh... I'm sorry.
See this? It's my Attorney's Badge.
(You're the first one who's actually been interested in mine, believe me.)
(She analyzed it. Scientifically...)
Sorry, but it's not for sale. Yet...
(Hmm, I wonder what's wrong with Ema? She got quiet all of a sudden as soon as we arrived.)
(Wh-wh-wh-what was that all about?)
Hey! How do you know me?
Er, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do...?
Y-you're a prosecutor!? (Two sisters... one a lawyer. Could this be a coincidence? Ema... Lana... I mean, they're just like...)
Smile for the camera...
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's frozen in fear of the frigid Miss Lana. I'm feeling a bit chilly myself.
W-which is?
Huh?
Well... why don't you begin by telling me exactly what happened.
That's quite specific.
Uh... My, that was a bit of bad luck, wasn't it?
The Prosecutor's Office, huh? (In your subordinate's car trunk? Classy...)
(My, my...)
So, who was the victim?
By... you?
I see...
Uh oh!
Well, it means...
(This case gets worse and worse with everything I learn.)
So, you're the Chief Prosecutor?
(That's an awfully large nutshell.)
Huh?
(How am I supposed to defend this!? Time to change the subject... Wait, she was in the class ahead of Mia, wasn't she...?)
Um, you were in school with Mia, correct? A few years above her?
(Hey!)
Different?
E-excuse me!?
Oh...
(It sounds a bit different when Ema says it...)
I polish it daily.
(Gah! What ever happened to innocent small talk!?)
E-excuse me?
Y-yes?
...! Um... you mean, you're requesting my services as your defense?
Right... I'll do what I can to get to the bottom of this.
(Lana has confessed to the crime, yes... But something doesn't fit. It's that look in Ema's eyes. There's something else going on here... and I'm going to find out what!)
Huh? About what?
... I just never expected to be defending another prosecutor again.
I see... (Sorry, but I'm having trouble imagining that.) What happened to her?
(Sounds like there's something there that defies a simple scientific explanation.) Let's go check out this underground parking at the Prosecutor's Office, shall we?
So this is the lot where it all happened?
(Funny that my first visit to the Prosecutor's Office should be like this...)
H-hey! What are you thinking?
Actually, there is. You know attorneys aren't supposed to examine crime scenes?
I'm trying to not stand out too much, here, see?
(Marshall? Looks more like a sheriff to me...)
(What's this guy talking about!?)
...
Was that uh, hombre, a friend of yours?
(Who thinks he's a sheriff from the Wild West it seems.)
You could see the whole parking lot from in there.
Huh?
Um. I hate to break it to you, but I think that's probably just a security guard office.
(Too bad they don't have a test for common sense.)
The arrow on the ground makes it look more like an entrance.
Well, maybe it's both. Kind of a dual purpose?
What? Uh...
Mr. Relativity? Are you sure that was his name?
I'm not sure that doors "mean" anything.
I fail to see what's mysterious about it.
Let's finish our investigation first, shall we?
Um... That's a stepladder.
S-scientific, huh?
(This all seems so horribly familiar somehow...)
Hey. Don't touch stuff we don't need to be touching.
(What is she babbling about?)
See? You can hear just fine. The phone's broken!
It's got a faucet for water.
(I fail to see how it makes any difference either way...)
An oil drum. Looks like it's filled with water.
The drum over here is on its side.
I think you'll probably just get arrested. (In fact, you may not even have to hide in the drum to get arrested.)
What's this? A wallet?
Um, excuse me! Officer!
What am I doing? I just found this wallet, so I'm handing it over to the police...
H-how is that scientific? (Sounds like theft to me!)
(By the way her eyes are sparkling, I can tell she's been waiting for this...)
This... This is an ID card. (Detective Bruce Goodman, ID # 5842189...)
I guess... Though I don't see what "science" has to do with it.
(I guess I've got to be on my toes from now on...)
(The sheriff!)
(Gah! Scary!)
(Prospector's Office? Where does this guy think he is? And when, for that matter!?)
(Maybe we should check out room 1202... the High Prosecutor's Office!)
(Right... great.)
Each badge has a number carved into it. That way, you can tell which attorney it belongs to.
No, I'd be found out right away.
A name and ID number are written here. "Detective Bruce Goodman, ID# 5842189"
What else would they use?
True...
"YABADAB"? Well, it does have a certain ring to it...
(It doesn't take much to amuse her.)
(What's this? She couldn't be...)
Y-yes?
Uh... thanks. (Interesting way of doing business.)
C-cough-up? Huh?
Whaaaat!?
Please! Cough-up Queen! Tell us what happened!
Y-y-yes, ma'am! (Yipes! She means it!)
Here, see this?
(What is this? A behavioral study of lawyers?)
You can say that again.
I'm not doing so well in either of those areas.
Let's come back later.
F-five thousand dollars!?
Th-that's enough of that. I don't need my life appraised thank you very much.
I guess you would feel... important.
(That's handy to know...)
With them already packed in so tight like that... what's he going to do when he gets new case files?
(I think that was a compliment...)
...
Yeah, I got it. (I'm glad she's not an aspiring comedienne...)
What's this? It looks like a shield of some kind... It's broken. Maybe it's made out of chocolate, and he took a bite out of it.
(This girl has a thing about pricing everything, doesn't she?)
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "Back from the Dead -- Wendy" ("Wendy?"... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "Between a rock and a hard place. -- Wendy"
Um... I don't think so.
A work desk. It's quite tidy, as one might expect.
I'd prefer not to have to look at myself while I work...
I go more for the instant tea bags myself.
(There's such a thing as taking a hobby too far...)
I'm not too up on my chess but it looks like Blue's in a bit of a tight spot.
Huh?
(Yeah, I know, but isn't the point to surround the King?)
Destiny...? Was yesterday special for some reason?
(Really what? I'm totally confused... One thing's clear. This lunch lady has a thing against prosecutors.)
So, what exactly was it that you witnessed, Ms. Starr?
!
Wait a second! You know Lana Skye?
(Now why would this pretty lunch lady know the Chief Prosecutor's name?)
(I don't even want to appreciate part of a trilobite's flavor.)
The glass-walled booth?
(Since you're here anyway... I guess selling lunches is more important than romance.)
(Useful analysis. Not.)
Did you have a bad experience with a prosecutor, Ms. Starr? I sense some... hostility.
(I wonder if Ms. Starr was involved in some sort of legal trouble in the past?)
(I thought she was just a lunch vendor, but now I'm not so sure...)
(A box of pickles...? Kind of a sad lunch if you ask me.)
About this card...
No, no, this isn't a credit card. It's an ID card. It belongs to a detective...
(Why do I always feel like I'm being mocked?)
Thanks.
(A trophy? What, that shield?)
(That voice...!) Long time, no see, Edgeworth.
...! You know him from somewhere?
(Right... her sister was the Chief Prosecutor, after all.)
Hey! Don't blame me!
(I'll say one thing, she certainly can scream.)
Lucky jacket, right... I've never seen him wear it.
(She's getting way too excited bout this.)
Odd... I thought Edgeworth wasn't good with heights.
(Strange... Why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?)
You wouldn't say that if you saw him sweating bullets up on that ladder.
Sofas like this make me want to curl up and take a nap.
(I don't believe it. She's actually daydreaming about Edgeworth working...)
Sofa-hair is cool!?
I've been wondering... what the heck is this?
Huh? What's that?
So that "K"... that's...
Well done, Edgeworth. You must be proud to be the King of Prosecutors!
(That still doesn't explain one thing... Why is the tip of this shield broken off?)
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "Back from the Dead -- Wendy" ("Wendy?"... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "Between a rock and a hard place. -- Wendy"
Um... I don't think so.
A work desk. It's quite tidy, as one might expect.
(Strange... Why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?)
Don't. He'll sue you.
I'm not too up on my chess but it looks like Blue's in a bit of a tight spot.
Huh?
(Edges... surrounding a pawn with spiky hair... Nah... It's nothing.)
So, the body was found in your car?
(Now that didn't sound forced at all...)
I can understand... W-wait!... What did you say!?
What do you mean?
(Miles Edgeworth... It's hard to remember a time when there WEREN'T rumors about this guy... Forging evidence, arranging false testimony, illegal searches, you name it...)
Wh-what? That's crazy!
(Toys? That bronze shield? There's got to be a story behind that one...)
(Two years ago... I wasn't even a lawyer yet.)
Um... Edgeworth?
Are you sure you didn't do it?
(C'mon, can't he take a joke?)
Could you tell me more about yesterday... the day of the murder?
And that's when you got the shield?
That's... very precise.
(The murder took place around 5:15...)
Say, Edgeworth, I was wondering about this...
Huh? What?
Oh. (He'll take it for sure, won't he.)
(If she sighs any deeper I'm going to start getting depressed...)
So, in other words, you were the best of the best this year, huh?
The Police Department?
Where Detective Gumshoe works? Yeah.
(He doesn't seem too concerned about his award, for better or for worse.)
(Nah. With Edgeworth it's never personal... It's all about winning tomorrow.)
Hm. It looks like the names of all the previous recipients are engraved on it.
Uh, yeah. That's probably it.
(When she says it, his name does have kind of a ring to it...)
"Miles Edgeworth - 17:12"... This is dated the day of the crime.
Perhaps.
Either that, or Edgeworth cut himself peeling an apple. What's Edgeworth doing with a knife like this anyway?
Edgeworth? In the wild? I think my fruit-peeling theory is more likely.
(Now there's a scary thought...)
(I don't like the way this conversation is going at all...)
(I think I just heard Edgeworth's lid blow.)
(Poor guy. Looks like he was absent on the day they gave out brains and good luck.)
Y-yes, sir!? (Gah! He caught me off guard!)
U-uh... Thanks. (He seems to have finally calmed down at least.)
(Fine. I'll just have to talk to him when he perks up.)
(Fine. I'll just have to talk to him when he perks up.)
(Fine. I'll just have to talk to him when he perks up.)
Could you take a look at this?
Y-yes!?
Uh, no, but thanks. (She didn't even look at me.)
(The only thing I'm smelling here is wasted time...)
That took almost 30 minutes by taxi... and traffic wasn't even that bad. This is my first time to the Police Department, actually. ? Hold on, what's that?
Oh, wait I know. This is the "Blue Badger." They're trying to make him the police mascot.
Forget the Blue Badger! Who's that next to him!?
He sure is running over here fast...
That's my line, Detective Gumshoe. Specifically, why were you dancing over there?
(Well, at least he doesn't seem to be busy. This is our chance to get information!)
The usual wanted posters are hanging up on the bulletin board here. <<Do you know this face!? If you do, dial 911!>>
... (She has a point...)
You made this, Detective Gumshoe?
Why is that?
Huh?
W-well, I don't know if this is all that exciting.
... Funny, I thought they were talking about the weather.
The detectives in there look pretty busy.
... (Somehow the thought fails to excite me...)
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
They make a good pair.
Nice slogan...
I don't think it's that kind of campaign.
I think most families can figure that out without the extra help.
No idea. Why?
A panda...?
Um... do you mind me asking how you came up with that theory?
... What about zebras? Or did they not have those at your zoo?
Huh? Me?
She's a relative of the suspect. Lana Skye's sister.
Detective Gumshoe! What did you do this time?
(I know this is an important trial, but isn't that a little odd?)
(Now that I think about it, Ema did seem to know that Marshall guy.)
So... this ID card belonged to the victim?
(And Lana's confessing as much...)
"Again"...?
(I had no idea he was under the gun...)
W-what!?
Detective... here's my attorney's badge.
(Wait... Speaking of ID cards, I found that detective's card, didn't I...?)
Um, Detective Gumshoe? What can you tell me about this?
(Meaning Detective Gumshoe must drop his card a lot.)
(That's what I thought...)
It's only scary because you keep dropping your card, Detective Gumshoe.
(I think I'll stay out of this conversation.)
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Ah... congratulations.
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
(Yeah, we've heard about the rumors...)
(The car and the knife do seem a little too well-organized to be a coincidence.)
(We have to find out a little more about what's going on with Edgeworth...)
No, I wouldn't want you to do that either...
Why aren't you handling the case, Detective Gumshoe? We met the guy who is... what was his name? The guy in the parking lot...
Officer Marshall... Is he some kind of Wild West sheriff or something?
For a moment there, I wasn't sure.
(I'll be surprised if this gets us anywhere...)
Maybe it was a letter or something to Detective Gumshoe.
No, that sounds about right. (At least in that detective's case...)
(Looks like the investigation is still going...)
(What happened to the security guard!?)
(Jake Marshall... Strange guy to put in charge of a crime scene.)
Huh...
(I think one body per murder case is enough, thanks.)
Well... should we show this hopeless case something to catch his interest?
Officer Marshall? Could you take a look at this?
(Somehow I don't think he's going to help us.)
Huh?
Remind me never to visit Texas.
Would you mind reading this for me?
It's a letter of introduction from Detective Gumshoe. May we investigate?
Huh?
Ah... I think he just miswrote it. (Great, Detective Gumshoe. I owe you one...)
(Officer Marshall isn't a "detective"... he's a "patrolman"... That reminds me of something...)
(I say I won't be needing this anymore...)
That looks like a cell phone.
(What's so scientific about that!?) Should we check it out?
On second thought, let's not.
Probably one of the Detectives dropped it.
(I don't know. One detective in particular comes to mind.)
(Right! Let's check it out.)
What's wrong with it? Everyone has different tastes, you know.
(I see he's as popular as ever with the kids...)
Redial...?
Sorry to disappoint you, but even I know about things like "redial."
(Whatever... Let's check this phone out.)
(Now, I wonder who the owner of this phone called last...)
Hey! That song! I know that!
Ah! Oh, s-sorry.
Uh, well, yeah...
Who did she call!?
Oh? That? Oh... I'm sorry, that was my phone.
Yeah, uh, it's kind of strange, but... Someone called me right as we picked up the other phone, a wrong number...
(Uh oh, I've incited the wrath of the Lone Star patrolman...)
Defense attorneys are relegated to "B Block."
I'm not planning on giving up my job that soon...
This appears to be the car where the body was found. (It looks like the lock on the trunk is busted.)
Yeah. Prosecutors get the big bucks.
Yep. They laid it in the outline of the victim's body.
... (You have got to be the only person I know that would come to that conclusion.)
What's this? Looks like a note of some sort.
You're right. Let's see... "6-7S 12/2"...
(Maybe it fell out of his pocket when he was killed.)
How am I supposed to know?
(I'm sure Edgeworth wouldn't know what this means either.)
It must have fallen out of Detective Goodman's pocket.
I have no idea.
(I'm sure Edgeworth would be just as confused...)
"B Block" is through there. That's where the visitors park.
Hey, you're right. I like the cute design on the door. (I can see... a cartoon cow munching down on a juicy looking steak.)
Just don't think too deeply about it and you'll be fine.
Officer Marshall? Could you tell us more about the victim?
Um... could you be a little more specific?
(I think he means the witness, Ms. Angel Starr.)
(So... there's no motive!)
Um, I don't mean any offense, but... Officer Marshall, you're a patrolman, right? Not a detective.
Huh?
Oh, really? (Now he tells me!)
So, why are you in charge?
Edgeworth...?
(Detective Gumshoe, kicked out of the investigation!?)
...!
(Is there something between this cop and her sister that I don't know about?)
(Dry wind or ill will, someone's up to something here... but who?)
Forged evidence... arranging testimonies, you name it.
One person? Who?
What, you're saying Edgeworth was making deals to win trials?
(Is that why Detective Gumshoe was taken off the case...? Did they target him because he was closest to Edgeworth?)
(Hey, that's a sheriff's badge!)
This is Detective Goodman's ID card. Strangely enough... We found it a good distance away from the crime scene.
You don't like him, right? We get the point.
Hey, they could use the same shield over and over.
(So what you mean is... The killer intended to use Edgeworth's car all along!)
(Why did Lana make that call...?)
(There's no need to push this again.)
Never mind. It's nothing.
I guess we got some clues... We have an autopsy report, a note from the victim, and a cell phone...
Well, the only thing still bothering me is that Lana is confessing to the crime. She says she did it!
Oh by the way, Ema?
I know that song your phone plays when it rings...
It's the Steel Samurai theme song, isn't it? That popular TV show... for kids?
The phone that just rang wasn't mine... it was yours. At 5:18, just after the murder took place... Your sister called you, didn't she, Ema?
Can you tell me what you talked about?
I see...
(A detective is murdered, and the suspect is the top prosecutor in the district. I've got a bad feeling about this... Like... maybe I still don't know everything that went on here...)  
No clues here.
Frankly, there are still a lot of... gray areas.
Yes?
Ms. Skye, you... You remind me a lot of Mia. But there is one decisive difference between you and her.
You're not a defense attorney.
(My first trial without a Fey helping me... No one's going to bail me out this time... I'll be alone in there... So I have to discover the truth all by myself!)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Edgeworth... I haven't been in court since Edgeworth's trial... It's been a while now.)
...!
(The "Cough-up Queen"...?)
(The judge is really wolfing it down...)
Uh... thanks.
(What the heck does pickled tapioca taste like!?)
(Hurry it up!)
(Just who is this lady!?)
Uh... I can't agree on principle, Your Honor.
(Wait, are they talking about me...!?)
I... I'm still thinking about that.
How did you know!?
Laid off...? (She was fired...)
This boyfriend... he's the detective?
(That would be the room with the "SECURITY" sign.) Incidentally, did you bring your lunchboxes by car?
You "sensed" something? So, you're saying you had a premonition of the murder?
Speaking of a "detective's instincts"... Wasn't the victim, Mr. Bruce Goodman, also a detective?
By "garish car," you mean...
(If she's telling the truth, we're doomed!)
We're dealing with Edgeworth here... I need better material before I start pressing this.
Witness! In your testimony, you clearly stated the following: Prosecutors are nothing more than worms. Ergo! You are a biased witness!
Huh? Rookie?
(I suppose that's more exciting than just hanging it around your neck.)
(Uh oh, that is unmistakably Lana Skye!)
Tell me more about this knife that the suspect was carrying.
Y-you can't testify as to her ability to kill an egg! I mean, a person!
And you witnessed this? You saw Ms. Skye stab the victim with the knife?
But... isn't that odd? Look at this photograph! This is the photograph you took of the very moment of the crime, is it not? Then why is Ms. Skye not holding a knife!?
Let's be a little more careful with our evidence, shall we?*
H-how can you tell that!?
Huh?
(It's a black-and-white photograph!)
(Argh... You got a better idea?)
Now that you mention it, I see no problem here. Other than myself.
(Perhaps I should have dug a little deeper...)
Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony! Namely, that she took the picture the "moment" she witnessed the crime!
...
Th-that's it!?
P-premeditated!? How do you know!?
Uh...
Waaaaaargh!
Tell the court why you didn't try to stop this crime! You did see her raise the knife to strike, no?
Too late...?
I... I see.
And you witnessed this? You saw Ms. Skye stab the victim with the knife?
But... isn't that odd? Look at this photograph! This is the photograph you took of the very moment of the crime, is it not? Then why is Ms. Skye not holding a knife!?
Let's be a little more careful with our evidence, shall we?*
H-how can you tell that!?
Huh?
(It's a black-and-white photograph!)
(Argh... You got a better idea?)
Now that you mention it, I see no problem here. Other than myself.
(Perhaps I should have dug a little deeper...)
Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony! Namely, that she took the picture the "moment" she witnessed the crime!
...
Th-that's it!?
P-premeditated!? How do you know!?
Uh...
Waaaaaargh!
What if she was just in the habit of wearing gloves? Like, driving gloves?
Arrrrgh!
(This is bad... She's got them thinking this was all planned... If she can prove this claim, the trial's already over! I've got to think of a way to show that this wasn't premeditated!)
Leads to:
You said that before. Anything else?
(Sounds pretty fatal to me.)
Let's just keep our heads cool and press the witness a bit, shall we? (For some reason, having her panicking next to me makes me calmer...)
Witness, do you know what this is?
The defense has a request. We ask that the witness provide an ACCURATE testimony.
In your testimony... You stated that Lana Skye planned this murder. And that's why she was wearing those special gloves.
However! Why would she not also prepare the most important thing... the murder weapon!?
This knife just happened to be in the trunk of that car. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to plan a murder, you don't forget the weapon!
(Great! Now the tide is turning in our favor!)
W-what!?
B-but this shoots a hole in the whole premeditated theory!
(Really now...)
You've said that, but you haven't told us how you know!
(Something's half-baked here alright, and it's you!)
You have no proof that Ms. Skye called him there!
(C'mon! You could have tried "public phone" first, at least!)
What kind of "grudge"!?
Of course you don't! That's because she didn't have a grudge!
H-how am I supposed to know!?
(This judge isn't very good with metaphors...)
A "human machine"!? That's a contradiction!
Umm... You say "again and again"... how many times did she stab him, exactly?
(How come she's getting mad at me!?)
(Leave it at that!? This is a murder case, people!)
You say she stabbed him again and again... But you couldn't have witnessed that!
(What about my objection? No one noticed?)
Her red muffler?
(She's right... Ms. Skye was wearing a red scarf... wasn't she?) But wait... Isn't it odd that you mistook that for splattered blood?
(A judge with a bib. That's why this place feels so much like kindergarten sometimes.)
(Apparently, Ms. Starr isn't entirely sure of her own testimony.)
Chance for what, I wonder...?
Leads to:
(Ms. Starr has turned out to be as short-tempered as she looked when we met her. Challenging her abilities as a detective really set her off!)
I wonder... wouldn't it depend on the size of the candle? I mean, add more wax and even a really short wick will burn longer...
Ms. Starr! I demand an explanation...
(What was my objection, chopped liver!?)
(Ultimately, we couldn't shake the most important part of her testimony.)
The part where your sister stabs the victim! (This next testimony might just be the moment of truth!)
That wasn't a very good metaphor. First of all, a cobra is a kind of snake.
N-no thanks!
O-oil drum? (Hard to imagine...)
So where is this "partition" on the floor plans?
(That's right... There was a wall there... about 6 feet high.)
You say "quickly"... were you close to the suspect?
(Hmm... maybe I should press her for more details?)
(How far away was she when she witnessed the murder? I guess I could just look at the picture to find out.) Very well, you may continue with your testimony.
I'd like to see this on the floor plans, just to be safe. The Lunchland car was...
So, you witnessed the murder from... here?
Is that correct, Ms. Starr?
(Yeah, that fence was about nine feet high, too. How come Ms. Skye didn't get away?)
She mentioned the muffler? What exactly did she say?
(Cheeky!)
(Her phone? You mean... this cell phone?)
(Ms. Skye's cell phone... The last number she called was her sister, Ema! Hmm... if I press this too hard, who knows who the snake will bite...?)
By phone... do you mean this cell phone, discovered at the crime scene?
(That's right! Near the car... there was an emergency phone on the wall!)
(Good witnessing? What ever happened to good testifying?)
So, you never saw this muffler?
(She doesn't strike me as the kind of witness to make careless mistakes, either... I'm sure she saw something red... but what!?)
Um... do you think you could restate your testimony for the court?
And you saw her doing this?
Leads to:
She "made to escape"... Can you be more specific?
(Huh?)
A-an oil drum!?
I wish we could solve a few before finding more, though...
(So Ms. Skye tried to run?)
Not as sorry as I am.
I have to conclude that you have a personal grudge against Ms. Lana Skye.
Well, Ms. Starr... This is a fatal contradiction with your testimony... How do you explain this?
Ahem. Let's look at the floor plans. You said you witnessed the crime from this point. However, if that's true... You couldn't possibly have seen Ms. Skye making that phone call!
I believe you see what I'm getting at. That emergency phone was on the back side of this partition. If, indeed, you were in B Block... You couldn't have seen it!
It's simple, Your Honor. She's not coughing up lunch...  she's coughing up lies!!!
(Here's where the counterattack begins! I can't afford to get this wrong!) The witness lied about...
She lied about what she saw! In other words, she didn't see Ms. Skye using that emergency phone!
(What's the matter, Starr? Cat got your lunchbox?)
Huh?
Oh... (Dang, she's right!)
Ugh. (One... one more try!)
She lied about the order of events! Ms. Skye used that emergency phone BEFORE the murder!
(That took the wind out of her sails!)
Huh?
Ugh. (One... one more try!)
She tried to use the emergency phone... but it was out of order. What is significant about this fact? Nothing. It would be pointless for her to lie about it!
The witness did actually see Ms. Skye using the emergency phone. In other words... Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from a different location!
Before you call my lie pointless... at least let me tell it!
(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...) The place from where Ms. Starr witnessed this crime was... here!
Leads to:
If she was here, she could see the emergency phone!
Oh...
(Is that really that fast?)
Ah... uh, yes, Your Honor.
I think! I mean, it's highly likely that's where she was.
Ah... uh, yes, Your Honor.
This is the only place where she could have been.
Not in this case, Your Honor. The witness, not being part of the Prosecutor's Office, couldn't park in A Block. The only place where she could have seen the crime and the back of the partition is here. I remember in your testimony, you said... You brought a lunch to your "boyfriend" in the security guard room, yes? Well, Ms. Starr?
(The guilty... is she talking about Ms. Skye...?)
Huh?
It "still stands"? I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth.
If a witness is found to be lying, they're guilty of perjury. She knows this. She wouldn't risk that without a good reason!
... Huh? M-me?
(Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from the security guard station... But she lied and said she saw it from B Block... It must make a vital difference... but what? What would change...?)
Why, the angle at which she saw the crime occur would change!
Uh, um, well... The security guard station is on the second floor... and um... She would have sort of a more 3-D view of the crime.
Um...
...
It's a difference in lighting!
Well, it means, uh... See, the security guard station is on the second level... So, uh, she would have seen the crime in better lighting conditions.
Um...
...
It changes the distance between her and the scene of the crime!
What she saw is not in question here. What matters is the time it would take her to reach the scene of the crime!
Ms. Starr! You witnessed the crime from the security guard station! Now, how long did it take you to go from there... to the scene of the crime, where you arrested Ms. Skye!?
Y-yes...?
(The quality of my lunches has gone from low to inedible.)
(Uh oh...)
(Do I have any evidence to stop this...?)
Leads to:
(I think I need more evidence before I go sticking my spork in this mess...)
...!
Leads to:
Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest! Think about it! You could make pasta in that amount of time! If you like it al dente!
A five minute "blank"... Isn't that strange!?
If you were a criminal... What would you do with five minutes, Your Honor?
But you have the instincts of a killer! You would run! But this time was different! Ms. Skye dawdled at the scene of the crime... she even had her picture taken! No true criminal would act this way! It's inconceivable!
(Th-that was too close!)
(That's the one she tried to foist off on me!)
(Is this another one of her trick lunchboxes!?)
(What's she going to pull out of her lunchbox this time!?)
It seems so. Edgeworth sure is celebrating.
It seems so. Edgeworth is looking pretty sullen.
It appears so. (Lana's right hand was bandaged when I saw her in jail. She must have cut herself at the time of the crime...)
On the sole of the shoe? It's got to be the victim's. He must have stepped in a puddle of his own blood.
(Hmm... This blood might be an important clue...)
Why did you lie about those five minutes?
The... results?
(This when the suspect is admitting she did it?)
And, you found this shoe at the scene of the crime?
(I'm happy for you and your lunchbox bag, really.)
So, you brought it to the forensics department?
(And she got away with her little coup because she used to be a detective...)
And that blood belonged to the victim, Detective Goodman?
You can't say for sure the blood belonged to the victim with a blood test!
Huh...
Uh, well... Blood comes in four types... A, B, O, and AB... However! You can't tell from a blood test whether a murder was performed... in cold blood!
M-millions of types?
(I was afraid he was going to say that...)
(I can't let this evidence go through without a fight!)
...!
A problem...? (This is critical! What's wrong with the victim's shoe?)
(No... there's nothing there. And if I just stab blindly at it, I'll hurt my case.)
I'm trying to avoid saying things off-the-cuff today.
If I'm not imagining things... I'd say there is one critical problem with this evidence... A clear contradiction!
Leads to:
The problem with this evidence... is here!
Uh...
(Hmm... guess that wasn't it.)
I wonder if you noticed... there's blood on the bottom of this shoe!
Leads to:
Edgeworth:
Arrgh...
(Man... tough crowd.)
(That's pretty sly, hiding evidence like that!)
(Hmm... maybe I should "investigate" this evidence a little more closely...)
The problem lies... in the footprint.
Note that the bottom of the victim's shoe is covered in blood. Then... isn't it strange? Why weren't any bloody footprints found by the scene of the crime!?
As you can see... There were no traces of any such footprints at the scene of the crime! That contradicts your claim about this shoe!
If there were bloody prints they would have been found. We checked the scene and found nothing of the sort!
Oh!
... Hey, I don't know why it's not there. I'm just good at finding contradictions.
(Get what!?)
(No kidding!)
W-water? (What does that mean?)
Whaaaaaaaaargh!
(That reminds me... Ms. Skye's right hand was hurt... Didn't she say she'd cut herself when she stabbed him...?)
W-what!? What can I do? Your sister has confessed to the crime, and she tried to conceal it!
Hey! It's clearly wet!
(It's not your fault... I knew I couldn't win this case from the beginning. And... it seems this is what your sister wanted anyway! ... I'm sorry, Mia...) ... ... ...
...!
(This is the last piece of evidence...)
Your Honor, wait!
N-no it can't. Then it will be too late! Look at this photograph, the last one submitted... This trial isn't over... until we give each piece of evidence proper consideration!
Yeah! (I'll think later!) Yeah, there's a problem! (Right or wrong, I've got to go ahead with this!)
Leads to:
Well... it's probably here! Don't you think?
The problem in this photograph... is here!
Sorry, Ms. Starr... But it's not going to be that easy! In fact, you've already told us why this is important to the case... You said as much in your testimony!!!
Leads to:
Well, Your Honor? How do you feel about that?
No, no, I meant, what do you think about the...
Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court...
Could it be that the "muffler" you heard mentioned... Was actually this exhaust pipe!? If so! That means this piece of cloth is vital evidence!
(Whew... that was close. But... we made it... at least for now!)
(He's still hungry!?)
Huh? What?
Pretty much. Except today we're swimming in quicksand. So what happened to your sister, anyway?
Hmm... Probably something to do with that piece of cloth.
I'm the one who's starting to feel tiny and insignificant to tell the truth.
What is going on over there, anyway? All the police I've seen these last two days have been really on edge.
(What does that mean!? In the photograph taken at the crime scene... she wasn't wearing a scarf!)
(Ugh... I have a bad feeling about this.)
(What's up? The judge keeps looking over at the prosecution...)
(What's with this guy? A strange, stuffy aura seems to be filling the courtroom.)
(Who on earth is he...?)
I'm afraid you're right. Very afraid. Um... sorry, but... who are you?
Eh? Uh, th-thanks...?
Little... Little Worthy...?
Chuh....? Chief of Police...!?
Hey! Th-that's...!
(So Ms. Starr wasn't just seeing things! When the crime occurred, Ms. Skye really was wearing that muffler!)
Y-yes?
The b-blade, Your Honor? Well, I don't see why not...
Yes, well. I think all you have to do is push that switch, and...
(Yeah. But if I cut my finger, I wouldn't be able to point it at people anymore...)
It seems to say "SL-9 2"...
Well... (I've heard something similar... "DL-6"... of "DL-6 Incident" fame...)
Huh? What is?
It says, "SL-9 2."
I'm not sure... (But it reminds me of a similar code... "DL-6." Maybe it's a case number?)
What?
(Maybe I should check the Court Record again.)
I'm the one who's scared!
(And this dark red stain... blood?)
(Two detectives killed at the same time in two different places...)
I'd... like to exercise my right to cross-examine the witness.
Excuse me... "special"?
Um... Might that special thing... be this little tag?
So this knife... was stolen?
(So this knife was stolen on the day of the murder... And it was found in the exhaust pipe of Edgeworth's car...)
This knife was found on the scene of our crime! I think that makes it connected to the case, don't you!?
(Hmmm... evidence that links this knife to Detective Goodman... I think perhaps the pieces are falling into place... I should try presenting the piece of evidence that's had me stumped all this time!)
Wait a second!
This knife... This has to have something to do with Detective Goodman!
Look at the tag on this knife! It reads "SL-9 2"...
Over here we also have... A memo that was on the body of the victim!
Your Honor... It's upside-down.
The printed name on the memo makes it look like it's right-side up... But turn it around and what do you get!?
When he wrote this note, he was holding the paper upside down!
I... win? Ah... (What game is this guy playing!?)
Something didn't happen at the Police Department too, did it...?
Well, what happened!? What happened at the Police Department that day?
On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
(Just arrested! That was quick...)
I suppose I could help... if you help me by giving me data on your case?
Well, how was the detective killed?
A kn-knife...?
Wh-what do you mean!?
(It seems like I'm going to have to press this a bit harder...)
So... when did the murder at the Police Department occur?
So, tell me... where was the victim found?
(The evidence room!?)
I can't say I've heard of it. (I guess I should ask again once I learn a bit more about this "evidence room.")
(W-wait a second... I have heard of that!)
(There's the connection between the two cases!)
Happy? We just got handed our ticket to go to town on this case! (With the link between the two cases established, we finally have some leverage. Now we can get Gant to testify about the details!)
Five... 5:15...!? B-but that's... That's when Detective Goodman was killed in the Prosecutor's Office!
(Coincidence!?)
Chief Gant, please tell us more about the incident!
How can you say there's no connection!?
(Whatever it is, I'd better find it and get to the bottom of this!)
Chief... The defense's position is simply this: The connection between these two cases has already been proven!
The connection is a place, mentioned in the testimony we just heard. The knife found in the lot was stolen... from the Police Department's evidence room.
And we also know that the detective murdered at the Police Department... was killed in that very same evidence room!
Can we get the information... unofficially?
(What? Really!?)
If you're going to tell us a little, why not tell us everything?
(Oh well... I guess I might as well try to get what I can out of him...)
Okay, well... What division was the victim stationed in?
(Homicide... that would be the same division as Detective Gumshoe!)
It's almost like a serial killer was after homicide detectives...
Well, I sure hope Detective Gumshoe isn't next on the list...
Okay... how about the gender of the victim!
Ah hah! He was a guy!
S-sorry, Your Honor. (Hey, tell that to the Chief of Police!)
Okay... How about you tell me the victim's ID number?
Of course not. You won't tell me their name, after all.
(You didn't even get the first number right!)
(The ID number of the victim at the Police Department... 5842189...)
Absolutely nothing, Your Honor.
First of all, it was too long! I've forgotten it already!
Actually, it does, Your Honor. It does...! I think!
(It has to be what I think it is... But what does this mean?)
Leads to:
The ID number tells me... this!
Well... Maybe I misheard. You know?
(And I'd like to request some straightforward information for once!)
(Two detectives were killed at 5:15... One at the Prosecutor's Office... And one at the Police Department... that can't be a coincidence!)
(I'd better check this knife out...)
Witness! ...
No, I... it's just, I got confused...
Huh?
(The Police Department... the Prosecutor's Office... Two places, two detectives murdered... at one time.) Actually, I happen to have a police ID number here.
N-no, Your Honor. I'm a defense attorney... remember? This is the ID number of our victim, Detective Goodman.
Detective Goodman's ID number is... "5842189."
Huh?
(You even got the first number wrong!) The number the Chief of Police gave us was... 5842189.
Mean? That's what I want to know! The two ID numbers are identical! In other words... The detective killed in the Police Department's evidence room was Bruce Goodman!
What does our witness think about that!?
Yet, a Detective Bruce Goodman was also killed at the Police Department... In the evidence room... at the exact same time!
Huh? Oh, well, it's, uh...
Huh? Uh... I... I was just doing my job.
Huh!? W-well, um... let's see. (What is going on?) The victim, Detective Bruce Goodman, was stabbed to death after 5:00 PM on the 21st. He died in the Prosecutor's parking lot... and the Police Department's evidence room.
... Well... that's what we're going to find out. (Or try to, at least...)
(Glad she's in good spirits, but I'm not sure she's going to be much help with this...)
Huh?
(Of course it was our victim who was killed at the Department...)
(Even though she says they don't get along, Ema really likes her sister...)
(Big words for a high school student.) Well, whether there was blood stains or not... The water in that oil drum washed it all away.
Huh? What's that grin for?
L-luminol?
But wouldn't the police have already done those tests?
M-me? Why do I have to do it!?
(We're testing blood stains with this stuff, not drinking it...)
Huh? You had an extra pair of those things?
(I can see her eyes shining behind those glasses...) So, is this a bloodstain?
Ema, you're shaking.
(Scientific investigation in action...)
(What's odd about this... scientifically?)
Why, the blood stain's location is odd! Elementary!
... I suppose you might think that.
(There is something odd about this bloodstain... But if it's not the location of the blood, then maybe...) Maybe it's the amount of blood that's odd?
The perpetrator and Detective Goodman fought here, right? Don't you think there'd be a little more blood?
(It's strange! If they fought here, there'd have to be more bloodstains than this.)
Uh, yeah. That's very... useful information to have.
Luminol Testing Fluid information received from Ema.
And we'll drag that "hidden evidence" out into the light of day!
(This luminol stuff is going to come in handy.)
Sorry, it's just, that kind of lead in doesn't really get my mouth watering.
You can probably see quite a lot from up there. (Hmm... That probably means she wasn't lying when she saw Ms. Skye stab him...) Where's the security guard, anyway?
(That woman is a force to be reckoned with...)
It sure helped us knock a hole in that testimony today. Come to think of it, this divider helped our case more than the actual witness.
It's just a wall. (Scientifically speaking...)
So, this is the famous oil drum.
Th-that's okay. Don't cry. (That Lana Skye must be a powerful woman...)
Yup, it's pretty red alright. (The body was found in Edgeworth's car trunk... And the lock on the trunk was broken too... So, the question is why did Ms. Skye chose his car?)
... I think it was called a "Sedan" or a "Coupe." Something like that.
(Maybe it is about time I got my driver's license...)
"2/21 SL-9"... The SL-9 Incident.
(And the detective in charge of the case was the victim.)
It's kind of hard to guess just knowing the case number.
"B Block" is through there. That's where visitors park.
I-it seems so, yeah. (That fence is 9 feet high at least!)
I-it's okay, don't cry. (Maybe there's a Lunchland Olympics team?)
Huh? I-it's not! It's my attorney's badge!
Look, my badge isn't up for sale. Not yet, at least.
We found this ID card here in this parking lot...
But... It's the same ID as the man who was killed at the Police Department.
(I wish I could be so sure...)
A body with Edgeworth's knife stuck in it was found in Edgeworth's car.
Gratitude?
(Hmm... I wonder.)
Do you think you could tell us more about the SL-9 Incident?
That's when you heard her talking about the "muffler," right?
(What was Ms. Skye really trying to say, I wonder?)
So, you went straight to the scene of the crime?
(That time...?)
Could you take a look at this?
Y-yes!?
Uh, no, but thanks. (She didn't even look at it.)
(The only thing I'm smelling here is wasted time...)
(Someone used a marker to write their name on this.) "Ema Skye" Don't tell me you bring this with you everywhere you go.
(Just what kind of a world do you think we live in...?)
This blood must be from when Lana...
But she did call you, didn't she? At the time of the crime?
And her right hand is bandaged.
This has nothing to do with "taking sides." (So... This means that Lana's hand had blood on it. This just keeps getting worse...)
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Oh, right, evidence law. So, did you learn anything?
Oh...
(Oddly enough I find myself identifying with her on this one...)
Mia's plant, "Charley." I've been taking care of him in Maya's absence. Huh? He looks a little yellow today...
Mixed in... what?
I told you, he's turning yellow!
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases.
(Sorry, Mia...)
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. Egad! The bellboy was staring right at me.
(Wish someone would say that about me...)
Well... where should we begin?
The mystery of the victim I guess. How could one man, Detective Goodman... be killed in two places simultaneously?
We should go to the Police Department... the evidence room was it?
(No, no! You're being very... helpful.)
Ah, about the killing at the Police Department, right. (The Chief of Police was right about that... But I can't help but think... Someone at the Police Department doesn't like Edgeworth...)
5842189... It's in the record.
... (Something to think about later when I'm not so busy.)
We defense attorneys are a scattered, unrecognized bunch.
It is pretty odd, huh? (I doubt it has anything to do with this case though...)
Right... or so the witness, Ms. Starr, claims. She saw your sister stab Mr. Goodman with this knife.
She's not the one on trial here.
Her eyesight isn't on trial here, either.
According to Ms. Starr's testimony... Ms. Skye used her phone right after the murder... she called you, right?
(Because it was an underground parking lot, I suppose...)
And photographing things? (This proves Ms. Skye was there at the scene of the crime! She is connected to this crime somehow... but how?)
Why would this have been in the car's exhaust pipe?
Right... the SL-9 incident. It was already solved, apparently. (This knife was stolen on the day of the evidence transferal... Maybe I should look into this "S-L9 Incident"...)
You don't say. How much does it cost?
Your allowance...? Does your sister give you that?
R-right...
A bottle of luminol testing fluid...? (Man, I'd just take the allowance myself...)
Looks like Ms. Skye is in questioning...
How's she supposed to answer that! (Wait a second... The Chief said they'd caught the criminal at the Police Department!)
This guard monitors the visitor's room. One murder at the Prosecutor's Office... one at the Police Department... He must be frozen with fear thinking that he might be next...
And it will be tidy tomorrow, too. Incidentally, he's not here.
I hope that's what he's doing.
(I guess we'll have to come back.)
I guess you would feel... important.
(That's handy to know...)
Better this than that giant Steel Samurai. (Edgeworth has always been like that.)
Back in elementary school, he won awards for all kinds of things. Speech contests, essays, playing the flute, golf tournaments...
But he always hated receiving awards. He'd make some smart remark like,
That's how he's always been.
Judging by the amount, my guess is it's from a nosebleed.
(Why does Detective Gumshoe's face come to mind...?)
It's even busier here today than it was yesterday.
(I suppose it makes sense--a detective did get killed in their own department.)
(She's like a kid at an amusement park.)
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's dancing. (Speaking of "dancing"... The whole Police Department has been dancing around like crazy since yesterday...)
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
They make a good pair.
Wow, everyone looks deadly serious here...
Yes, but the same detective was also killed at the same time in the Prosecutor's lot.
Well, first things first. I want to check out the crime scene here.
I doubt anyone wants more mysteries or dead bodies around here right now. (But... it doesn't look like anyone's going to help us much, either.)
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
So this is the police mascot, is it?
(Don't show her the moving mock-up outside then, you'll give her nightmares.)
That must be the Head Detective. He's glued to his computer screen.
(Someone's getting a demotion...)
What's with the decor in this place? It's very... eccentric.
So, beyond that door is the evidence room... the scene of the crime?
What's wrong?
(If you can't handle the cacti, stay out of the desert...) What I want to know is, if this is a guard station, where is the guard?
It looks more like a costume than a uniform, honestly.
(It's a "poncho," but I think I'll keep that information to myself for the time being.)
I would think just one big one would be sufficient.
M-Ms. Skye?
... You know, I've been looking at this cactus a while now, and I don't see the resemblance.
It looks like there's a video feed from the evidence room here.
But look, it's nailed shut. You can't get in that way.
I'd say it'd be more of an "Yeeeeaargh," myself.
Hmm... looks like it's set up to trap something.
You sure have an active imagination.
The evidence room is beyond that door.
You thought it'd be open? (I think we'd need someone's permission to go in there first...)
Hm. There's clearly blood around the thorns here. This room's pretty messy. Someone must have tripped over something... and planted their head right in these thorns.
My apologies, Ms. Starr, but...
(I know this photograph has something important to tell us... but what?)
Coughed it... up?
I wouldn't doubt it.
And... you were "let go"? Er... fired?
Ess... el..? (Wait! She doesn't mean...!)
(E-executed...?)
What!? But the criminal was executed, right?
(Wait, could it be...?)
You haven't forgotten SL-9?
(Ms. Starr's old boyfriends... How many does she have, anyway?)
(Just when the detectives on this case have disappeared, we find new evidence...)
Wh-what!
Yes.
A... Salisbury Steak Lunch?
(This would be when Officer Marshall was a detective.)
(Officer Jake Marshall... Hmm...)
No doubt it's all cold and tough by now.
So long as she didn't put any other organs in there...
Let's see... "Ingredients: Meat"
Uh... yeah. Let's hope so.
Go to town.
So that's why the sauce is so salty...
(This place is charge with frantic energy, as always.)
Detective Gumshoe!
(I think I just heard the sound of his heart breaking.)
The criminal... you mean...?
On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
But, Detective Gumshoe, who was it?
Well, this investigation is off to a running start.
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
They make a good pair.
Uh, yeah, I guess they did. (Best to not go too far down that road right now. Things will just get confusing.)
(Wait... he isn't... is he?) You... Officer Meekins... You didn't... did you?
(Now this is an unexpected turn of events...)
Smile for the camera... Poor Officer Meekins... I think he knows he's being watched.
This guard monitors the visitor's room. Seeing a fellow patrolman in here must make him worry about his own fate in life.
Ow. I can hear you fine, Officer Meekins.
(M-Marshall!?)
(What the heck is this guy doing?)
(How long were you out!? Days!?)
(A bandage on his hand... just like Ms. Skye.)
First things first... tell us how you hurt your hand!
Um, I don't mean to pry, but you are the perpetrator, correct? You killed Detective Bruce Goodman in the evidence room... right?
Um, I would, but you happen to be in detention. And alive and well at that.
Did you know the victim, Detective Goodman?
So... you didn't know him?
(At least someone around here is more confused than I am.)
Can you tell me what it is you do "remember"?
And that's why you thought he looked suspicious...
So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
(Detective Goodman pointed a knife at him?)
(Right...)
And your hand... that happened when Detective Goodman was stabbed?
"Nothing you could do"...?
The next thing you knew you were... huh?
(The victim's body... disappeared...?)
What do you mean, Ema?
In other words, we have no way of knowing if the victim was really the victim!
But... you don't remember the events clearly?
...
N-no thanks, I have my own. (Well, guess we'd better go check out the crime scene.)
Officer Meekins, have a look at this.
Ha ha... huh?
(Is he talking about those badges on her coat?)
(I'd like to think there's a difference between my badge and a fashion accessory...)
You mean you remember what happened?
(I'd better pry into this one a little deeper.)
Officer Meekins, this is for you!
It's okay, I just wanted you to take a look at it.
(Hmm... He's overreacting to the knife, but I guess he's been through a lot.)
From the day... It was taken at the Prosecutor's Office.
(If this is a dream you'd better wake up right now!)
Officer Meekins, could you take a look at this?
It takes a special kind of man to pass the buck to Edgeworth...
(It's Chief Gant!)
(The Head Detective looks a little flustered...)
Oh ho ho, Chief Gant! Reporting for duty, sir!
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
The date on it is February 21. (I'll make a note of that just in case.)
(I should probably get a quick look around the crime scene...)
Um... is Edgeworth going to be okay?
You mean... the incident on Gourd Lake?
(von Karma...)
W-wait! I didn't do anything wrong! He did forge evidence.
(The murder at the Prosecutor's Office...)
What evidence is this...?
(I wasn't expecting much anyway.)
(I wonder what it was that he wanted the Head Detective to do?)
Actually, I was wondering if I could ask you a favor?
I was wondering if we could investigate the evidence room?
A-actually, I'm sorry, I d-don't need to investigate after all!
Huh?
I was wondering, could you have a look at this?
Either him or the Dancing Blue Badger.
You seem... happy.
(I think this place is a bad influence on the girl.)
The evidence room is beyond that door.
Ah hah! The card reader is turned off, see?
O-Officer Marshall! (Somehow, I knew...)
(Looks like the card reader's on again.) While we're here, I was wondering if we could ask you some questions?
You're... busy, then?
(Actually, you said you had "no mind to tangle with us hombres.")
Billy... The cactus has a name?
(Looks like it got stuck on the thorns and he couldn't get it off.)
Huh?
Hmm... looks like it's set up to trap something.
(Detective Gumshoe, I presume...)
The evidence room is beyond that door.
(Let's get this investigation started already...)
I think he was just too hungry to talk.
(Well, in any case, we need to get cracking on this investigation, pronto!)
Actually, Officer Meekins at the detention center told us.
He told us something. He said that, when the stabbing occurred... you weren't at your station.
You mean the security camera system?
Two days ago... the day of our case!
(Edgeworth was talking about the transferals, too.)
(Those are the ones that Officer Meekins mentioned.)
(You're the security guard and you "reckon"!?)
(Thus the card reader by the door.)
(So this is the ID card record...)
(Maybe there's some way I can prove that record is tied to the stabbing.)
Sorry, but could you explain what this whole "transferal" thing is about?
So, what happens to the evidence after two years?
(And that happened to SL-9 two days ago...)
The number on this is... "5842189."
It was used at... 5:14. Right before the stabbing!
(But wait, what did Officer Meekins say?)
So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
(If he had his ID card then... Why would he have pointed a knife at Officer Meekins?)
(I've got an idea... Maybe I should show this list to other people with IDs here...)
(Finally, it seems like...)
(Looks like we need some evidence to get anywhere with this guy.)
(It's quiet... the investigation must be over here.)
Graveyards are supposed to have grass and trees. This feels more like a morgue.
Yeah, it's true.
Just for today?
(Gee, thanks...)
Looks like you don't need an ID card to get out.
... (Let's hope he remembers we're in here.)
That looks like... a car door.
Maybe the guy they caught was some sort of escape artist and he got away.
He's been shot square in the forehead.
There's something sticking out of here.
I wonder if Detective Gumshoe put this here.
I bet he doesn't tuck in his shirt under that trench coat, either.
I'm not so sure about the dreams.
I guess I should have known.
Some sort of bulky equipment is gathering dust here.
Wait, I've seen that somewhere before...
Oh, right! Wow, that feels like it was ages ago. And... hmm, I don't think I've seen this one before.
(That cheap-looking box?)
Wh-what's this...!? Blood!
It looks like someone tried to wipe it off.
(We should use her testing fluid to check it out.)
Detective Gumshoe, perhaps?
(Another piece of SL-9 evidence...)
(Let's not waste too much time with this now.)
I wonder what shape these pieces were in before whatever it was broke?
(Well, this piece looks like the bottom. Let's try putting the rest in place!)
It's no use. These pieces just don't add up to anything!
(Hmm... maybe I'll give it another shot later.)
I bet they were missing to begin with.
If you put these pieces together, it makes a jar.
I'll make sure to remember that next time I make a jar.
(Detective Goodman's locker!)
(It's empty... they must have taken the contents elsewhere.)
Detective Gumshoe, maybe?
You mean SL-9? (It does have a tag on it...)
Perhaps we're witnessing the birthplace of the Blue Badger?
(Here? In the evidence room!?)
(In other words, Detective Gumshoe got kicked out of the investigation again...)
You have a locker in here, too, Detective Gumshoe?
I see...
That case...?
(Maybe we can get him to tell us more about the case...)
Using this ID card?
Violent... so it was a murder?
(A serial killing... Maybe I don't want to get involved in this after all.)
Rumors... (About forged evidence?)
The victim took the knife out of the evidence locker himself?
Detective... here's my attorney's badge.
That's only because you always lose your card.
(Detective Gumshoe, rebel against the system.)
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Ah... congratulations.
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
Really? Why?
(I sympathize with Detective Gumshoe... but I can see why they moved it.)
Because of the SL-9 connection?
But, why would evidence from that case turn up now?
Anything you can tell us about it?
(I wonder if Detective Gumshoe wore a trench coat in high school, too.)
Could you take a look at this? This is the ID card of the person who came here on the day of the stabbing.
It's not your ID number is it, Detective Gumshoe?
(Why would Edgeworth have come to the evidence room!?)
That's... fine.
There's no reason for the murderer to touch this spot if he fled out the door. (This just might be something significant!)
Where do you get this, Ema?
(Well, I'd better jot this down on the floor plans.)
What's the matter, Detective? Th-this locker... It's mine!
(This is an important clue! I'll jot it down on the floor plans...)
There must have been a massive amount of blood here. (I've never seen so much before...) I'm not a professional. What's your opinion, Detective?
I'll make a note of it on the floor plans.
The tag says, "SL-9 11." I guess this is another piece of evidence from that case.
Huh? What's so confusing about that?
"Xag"...? Is that a word?
What, are we playing a word game now?
Hmm... Looks like blood.
Not likely. This blood looks like it's been here for months, maybe longer. (This jar was evidence in the SL-9 Incident... That might be when the blood got on it.)
That's weird.
Better yet... What's the purpose of a bottomless jar?
Was there something you needed to be going to?
The one that says nothing but "No problems"!?
(Who needs enemies when you've got friends like Detective Gumshoe..)
(I should probably see what Edgeworth has to say, too.)
A piece of white cloth is sticking out... looks like a shirt.
Hey, don't look at me! I didn't leave it hanging out like that!
I'm not so sure about the dreams.
I guess I should have known.
Aren't you being a little dramatic? Looks like a fishing pole... and a metal detector. Not sure what this one is.
Can't junk just be plain old junk?
Only Detective Goodman himself can open this locker.
(And why was it wrapped in the "scarf" muffler stuck inside the "car" muffler?)
(I think maybe you're overreacting a little...)
I am wearing a red necktie, you know...
Oh! It's you!
Huh!?
(Is Edgeworth here...?)
(He has the hotel bring him tea service!?)
By the way, Detective Gumshoe was looking for you.
(Er, I think the report is on the other side, Edgeworth...)
So, how did the inquiry committee go?
"Again"...?
Are you okay for the trial tomorrow?
Something happened?
I... see.
(Wow, I've never seen him this out of sorts...)
(That wacky old coot was involved in the case two years ago too then...)
(What I want to know is why was a Deputy Chief of Police on the investigation?)
Wait, you didn't...
It all has to do with that case you were on... the SL-9 Incident. And some "dark suspicion" you were wrapped up in.
(A bad memory... he's talking about the murder in the elevator...) Okay, Edgeworth. Why don't you tell me about it. Tell me the truth.
Oh, right! I'd better check this now...
Edgeworth, you went into the evidence room that day, didn't you? Just before the incident occurred, no less.
But... it was solved, right? It would have to be if the evidence was already filed...
(Now I'm curious about this other case. I'd better make a note of it.)
I'll pass on the tea. Just tell me about the case...
(Whose side are you on, anyway? Maybe if I just show him my best evidence I can get some reaction out of him.)
The tag says, "AI-16."
Nothing, apparently. At least, that's what Edgeworth said.
Wouldn't that be nice...
Edgeworth... I'm really--
I, uh, th-thanks! (How about giving these to Detective Gumshoe as well!?)
Right! (I do seem to remember seeing a suspicious handprint somewhere...)
(Our investigation turned up a suspicious handprint.)
Let's use the secret weapon we just borrowed!
A finger...?
I really can't tell the difference at a glance...
(Ema's starting to get that sparkle in her eyes...)
Huh? How do you do that?
Ah... it looks like that did the trick.
Huh? How do I do that?
Wow... that looks like fun! (It might take some getting used to though...)
(I guess I'd better give it a try...)
But... this looks nothing like a fingerprint.
What does it mean?
Out of luck...?
... Don't tell me we've been wasting out time here!
Other prints...?
(Hmm... fingerprints outside the blood...)
D-dazzling...?
So we're not over yet? This is quite a process...
(I guess she's right...)
Huh? How am I supposed to know who it was?
C'mon! How am I supposed to guess whose they are?
...
I was just thinking, if you're so sure who it is, why don't you match the fingerprints?
F-fine, fine! (Let me think... who could have left these prints...?)
...
I guess that's probably because I was thinking "so what?"
Thanks for the sympathy. (Wait... If I remember correctly... there was one other handprint in this room. Let's check it out!)
This is where we got a luminol fluid reaction, right?
(There go her eyes sparkling again...)
Actually, let's not check.
(Hmm... maybe I better check for those prints after all.)
Okay, let's check for prints!
What?
We only ended up finding it using chemical means.
Oh... right. So... that means no prints.
D-don't ask me!
(Prints other than the ones left by the bloody hand...)
Hmm... I gave it my best shot.
But it doesn't look like we'll get a clearer result from this print.
Hey, these fingerprints, they...
It's Officer Marshall!!!
Ema. This* are decidedly different from Detective Gumshoe's prints.
The luminol reaction. The blood and the fingerprints are in the same place.
(So, we have Jake Marshall's fingerprints... on a wiped bloodstain!)
It looks like our investigation is finally turning up some results!
I guess this is what you'd call "decisive evidence"!
No clues here.
(I think I'd like to try one of the other fingerprints.)
I think the prosecution is as confused as we are. After all...
I hope they didn't hold you too long for questioning.
Ms. Skye.
We discovered traces left by a certain person in the Police Department's evidence room. They belonged to Officer Jake Marshall.
Blood-stained fingerprints, to be exact.
That's the trump card I have up my sleeve today. You do understand what this means, don't you?
We have to play the cards we're dealt. Isn't that right, Ms. Skye?
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Wow... this is one messed up trial...)
And that's supposed to be an admirable trait?
(Hoo boy. Things are getting wild from the get-go.)
...
(What I need here is more info to work with!)
Mr. Meekins. You work in the General Affairs Department, do you not?
(Yikes! Now there's a scary thought.)
In order to enter the evidence room... you need an ID card, am I correct?
So then... your ID number should be listed in here, right?
I see... Huh? But the number 4989596... is shown as being used twice!
So you were attacked... Can you please tell us exactly what happened to you?
(You aren't exactly the kind of person someone would want to run into...)
What exactly do you mean when you say you, "did it"?
You took his knife?
I, uh, see... (He must have been desperate.)
About what time did you regain consciousness?
Oh... right.
Your "mission"...?
(Well, we can all rest easy now...)
Well, we need to try and skim some more detail from him. For starters, what was an officer from the General Affairs Department doing in there in the first place?
(He's got a point...)
Delivered it...?
(Looks like communication with the Police Department is as good as ever...)
(A video of a real murder... Just what are we getting ourselves into...?) ...
(Why am I not surprised this isn't going smoothly?)
(I don't know where this cross-examination will lead, but everything begins with contradictions. That's where I have to start!)
Tell me, were you able to get a good look at him? At the face of the man who attacked you with a knife?
The latter? But you were standing right in front of him, were you not?
(Yeah, that's a good trait for a police officer...)
But you don't know that for sure, do you? You never actually saw Detective Goodman's face.
Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.
This contradiction leads to the possibility that... the man may not be Detective Goodman.
(He would want me to point it out...)
(I have to point out a problem in the video? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)
(How did this guy ever become a police officer?)
Leads to:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
The point...?
Oh, yeah.
(Rats... I need to slow down and tackle these things one piece at a time. Now what do I do?)
Very well. Let's try this again.
(It seems I've been taking the wrong approach.)
(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?
(Now what do I do?)
Very well. Let's try this again.
(It seems I've been taking the wrong approach.)
(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
About these lockers... Is there no other way to open them?
(I wonder what kind of methods he's tried...?)

"People in the know"?

However, the most important detail is not shown in this video... the man's face!
(Is there a problem with the security video?)
The tape was provided by the Police Department, so there's no problem with it.

(It seems I've been taking the wrong approach.)
(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
(This all sounds true enough, but the victim's body was found at the Prosecutor's Office. There has to be a mistake somewhere...)
The security video... (Maybe I should take another look at the footage...)
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this! Officer Meekins.
As I understand it, the locker apparatus works like this: When you grab the handle, a sensor reads your fingerprint. If the print matches the registered data, the light turns on and the lock is released.
If so, then something is seriously wrong with this picture! When the victim reaches for the handle to open the locker... Let's rewind to a little earlier... Here! Notice the light?
Precisely my point, Your Honor. The locker was already open before the victim grabbed the handle!
It's very simple, Your Honor. The locker wasn't locked on the day of the crime!
Me, Your Honor?
Me, Your Honor? ... Yes, well. You see... This isn't exactly my field... What do you think, Miss "Scientific Investigator"?
(Something... jammed the sensor? Say... There's something else that seems out of place in this video.)
Leads to:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
Uh, no Your Honour. That's not exactly what I meant...
What?
(I've got to stay focused on that locking mechanism.)
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?
Please watch closely. This is the continuation of the part I showed you earlier.
We can't be sure that item was in the locker to begin with.
The sensor triggers the lock when the door is shut... What if something was inserted, say, between the sensor and the door?
This white thing wasn't inside the locker... It was stuck between the door and the sensor!
there just might have been something that fits the description.
(I think I've finally got this figured out.)
Leads to:
Behold! This was stuck in the locker door!
Huh?
(I think my own current's just been blocked.)
(Something thin enough to slip in the door, yet not conductive to electricity...)
I found this near the locker: a thin rubber glove.
It has a tag that says, "SL-9 Incident."
The video seems to depict the victim opening the locker, but that isn't the case! The lit lamp attests to this. On the day of the crime, even I could have opened that locker! Is this not so, Officer Meekins!?
What!?
(Is this a joke...?)
"Special" cases...?
(Me too, although it doesn't make much of a difference...)
So, unlike your earlier testimony, you believe this to be rock solid, do you?
Is that card hanging from your neck one of these ID cards?
But what if someone were to steal it from you, keeping it out in the open like that?
(Maybe I should just leave this one alone...)
Leads to:
Let it be noted that this is the record the witness referred to.
? (What's the matter?)
(You've got the wrong color, kid.)
Leads to:
Earlier I believe you testified that when you asked the man to show his ID card, he pulled a knife on you.
Don't you think that's odd? I mean, if he had his ID card, all he had to do was show it to you. There wouldn't be any reason to draw a knife!
(Everything stems from contradictions. Let's point them out...)
Leads to:
I'm... confused.
(The problem with this ID card testimony is far too obvious. It's not like Edgeworth to miss something like this...)
Wait one moment, Officer Meekins.
I have the victim's ID card right here. I found it at the crime scene.
When I say, "crime scene," I'm not referring to the evidence room at the Police Department. I mean the "other" crime scene... The underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office!
Your Honor... I have one more piece of evidence to present. It's a very important clue regarding the victim's ID card.
but it shows that Detective Goodman had lost "something" on the day of the crime. Something important enough to fill out this report.
I can't say for sure... but there is a high probability! On the day of the crime, Detective Goodman was not carrying his card!
It can only mean one thing. It doesn't require much thought! The man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman, but rather the man who stole his ID card!
...?
B-bravo...?
Yes... (What's he up to?)
Uh... Th-that is... Well, I guess that's right...
This isn't good...
Aaaah! (I knew that testimony was way too shabby. It was all a trap from the beginning!)
(What do I do? How am I supposed to get myself out of this mess?)
Leads to:
(I'd better pace myself. If I rush ahead, I might run right into another trap!)
!
Leads to:
One moment, Your Honor!
Of course not. But I almost walked right into the prosecution's trap!
This cross-examination has proven one thing and one thing only. The security video did not show the actual murder. However! It cannot be said that it is unrelated to the murder in the parking lot. Specifically, large amounts of blood traces were found in the evidence room!
The defense demands further examination into the truth of the matter!
(This just might be my chance. Time to call a certain Texas ranger to the stand!)
Your Honor. The defense would like to request a specific witness.
Someone we have reason to believe knows the truth... The truth behind the activities that took place in the evidence room.
Leads to:
Judge:
(That's right! Those bloody fingerprints we found in the evidence room... Now's my chance to bring him in to testify!)
Officer... Jake Marshall.
(I can't let him know everything just yet...) He's in charge of the evidence room. I feel we should hear what he has to say.
Huh? What do you mean?
Uh... (I haven't figured anything out...)
Oh, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
My name!?
The "SL-9 Incident"?
Ms. Skye... was a witness?
...
E-Ema! But why... Why is your name in here?
Ema, wait! (She ran away...)
A number is engraved on the back of the badge. I wish they'd put my name on it instead...
His name and ID number is written on it. "Detective Bruce Goodman, ID# 5842189"
"King of Prosecutors." The names of past recipients are etched on the plate. Manfred von Karma's name appears too... How ironic.
The victim Bruce Goodman's blood still remains on the blade. I wonder if Edgeworth got this knife because the handle matches his clothes...?
"Miles Edgeworth - 17:12"... It's dated the day of the murder.
Come to think of it, I don't have a strap on my mobile phone at all. I hate having useless things dangling off it.
The redial button. It dials the number of the last person called. The last call was to Ema. I wonder what they spoke about...?
Blood is splattered over the white enamel surface. It must be Lana's blood, form the cut on her right hand she now has bandaged.
These blood traces are from Bruce Goodman, the victim. He must have tried to run after he was stabbed.
"SL-9" is written on a small tag attached to the knife. It was the weapon used in that incident two years ago; and has known many victims.
Ema Skye is written on the side in permanent marker. She seems awfully possessive about a can of luminol.
"AI-16" is written on the tag. That means it has nothing to do with the current case.
"SL-9 11" is written on the tag. It seems this is more evidence from that incident.
There's a trace of old blood on this jar. This was evidence in the SL-9 Incident... The blood must be from back then.
The jar has no bottom, so the hole goes right through. I wonder if it's really jar, or some kind of weird telescope...?
(Jake Marshall, Angel Starr, Damon Gant, Miles Edgeworth... Not to mention Lana and Ema...) Everyone involved in this case is connected to those killings two years ago... This can't be just a "coincidence."
(I'd better take a good look at this file...)
(Ema didn't come back...)
("Howling wind"...? I've never heard Edgeworth described that way before...)
Wait a minute... What do you mean by "two security systems"?
Yes, well, what about the fingerprint activated locks inside the evidence room?
(He's not being very helpful...)
How exactly did you "keep an eye" on the evidence room?
You "interred" them?
(This guy has a flare for the dramatic, but it isn't going to do him any good.) So, in actuality you don't physically enter the evidence room?
But you made your rounds on the day of the crime, right?
... Um, I'm afraid I don't understand.
(No desperados I know join the police force...)
(How does this guy avoid being fired...?)
You used to be a detective, so you've used the evidence room in the past, correct?
And yet... you didn't know about the fingerprint locking mechanism?
That's quite, uh... incredible.
(Now that he mentions it, Detective Gumshoe said something like that too...)
What were you doing in a place like that?
(That's strange... This is usually where Edgeworth says, "Did you not want a raise this year?"...)
Leads to:
Out of "ammo," officer Marshall?
(Apparently your superiors don't...)
Leads to:
(Okay... I have a trump card up my sleeve, so I'd best keep my cool. Before I use it though, I'd better up the ante...)
Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd? That is, you being called in to testify like this?
After all, you weren't in the security room at the time of the crime.
It's quite simple. You left a very large trail behind at the scene. Or, to be exact... a handprint.
I only wish it were, Officer, but you see... your fingerprints were covered in blood!
The blood was wiped away. However! A luminol test clearly revealed this! Well, Officer Marshall?
!
(This guy's hiding something, I can feel it! Now's my chance to prove it.)
That's because you... how did you put it... "pay your respects," once a month?
I see...
(Apparently his fingerprint data was never changed. He must have been using the fingerprint lock without even knowing it.)
The picture...?
!
(The security tape...)
Y-yes, Your Honor.
So then... What about the bloody handprint?
The chances of that happening are a million to one!
Unrelated?
(I don't see what homonyms have to do with this...)
How do you know that!?
That's right, it was found on Detective Gumshoe's locker.
(Oh yeah, I think we tried that too.)
The picture...?
!
(The security tape...)
Y-yes, Your Honor.
What do you mean by that?
...
But that video is next to useless! It's full of blind spots!
Places you can't see! The camera's panning back and forth, the floor isn't shown... If someone was familiar with the camera's position, he could leave the room without being caught on tape!
(I might be walking right into Officer Marshall's trap. It's better to find out a little more information.)
Very well. Allow me to point out your mistake, Officer Marshall!
Leads to:
There! How's that for evidence!?
(Oh great, now Edgeworth is defending me. Guess that means I missed the mark.)
(I can't let him squirm out of this one. I've got to find something, something decisive, to tie Officer Marshall to this crime!)
Bringing our attention back to the security camera... is a mistake I'm afraid you'll soon not forget, Officer Marshall.
Very well. You can clearly be seen in this video!
The key... lies in a certain locker shown in the video.
Now then, let's rewind the video a bit.
When the crime took place... The white cloth wasn't there. Then... it suddenly appeared! There's only one explanation: Officer Marshall! You were in the evidence room at the time of the crime! What's more, you opened your locker when the camera was turned away!
...
(This guy isn't just playing dumb... He really doesn't know!) Uh, I hate to rain on your parade, but you're the only person who can open that particular locker.
Leads to:
Marshall:
S-sorry, Your Honor... (If that's Officer Marshall's locker... Then only he can open it. I should know this!)
We talked about this earlier today. The lockers can only be opened by the detectives they belong to.
(Well, Detective Gumshoe did mention something about this...)
So, sheriff! What do you have to say... in eight words or less?
I assure you this is no joke, Officer Marshall. Now then, please tell us what you were doing in the evidence room at the time of the crime?
(What is he now, a bullfighter?) That's alright, Officer Marshall. I believe we can figure the rest out from here.
Have a look at these floor plans. There is no place for someone to hide in the evidence room. Yet, Officer Meekins didn't see Officer Marshall.
(That's right. The only possible conclusion!)
Leads to:
Officer Marshall was standing right here!
(Now they're ganging up on me!)
(Officer Meekins should have seen him in the evidence room. That means the only place he could have been would be...)
Officer Marshall was standing right here!
May I point out though, that Officer Meekins did not know Detective Goodman. He also testified about the man's reaction when confronted.
Yes? And how did Detective Goodman respond?
Something about the Officer's story puzzled me. If the man had his ID card, why didn't he just show it?
The answer is simple. He couldn't show it.
As you can see, Detective Goodman's picture is on his ID card.
If he showed that, his cover would have been blown! Officer Meekins would have realized the man wasn't Detective Goodman. Do you have anything to say to this, Officer Marshall?
Circumstantial evidence...? (He's still denying it!)
Well... (Who am I kidding? I don't have anything like that...)
Ack! (This can't be happening! It's so obvious he's the one! What can I do...?)
!
The basics... (For me, that would be what Mia used to tell me!)
(I shouldn't look for proof that Officer Marshall was in disguise... but rather I should look for evidence that came about because he was in disguise!)
(Which means he didn't originally plan to open his locker...!)
Perhaps... Perhaps the video is the key to all our unanswered questions. (I don't have any evidence, so this video's my only shot!)
Leads to:
Well, what do you have to say to that!?
Why?
Huh!?
(Now I'm an "unsolved case"? Something went wrong in that evidence room... That's why Marshall had to open his locker. The accident itself is the reason! I'd better have another crack at this...)
For some reason, you disguised yourself as Detective Goodman, and entered the evidence room. I don't know what that reason was... yet.
However, something unexpected happened. Officer Meekins barged in on you. When asked to show your ID card, you pulled a knife on him. However! Officer Meekins panicked, and the white coat you were wearing was soiled with blood!
You couldn't just walk out like that, so you hid the coat in your locker.
Officer Marshall! Tell the court what you did... all of it.
(It looked like too much blood for that...)
When you say "it," you mean...
(The SL-9 Incident...)
But what did you hope to accomplish by sneaking into the evidence room?
(But Officer Marshall wasn't in charge of that investigation. Why does he care so much about it?)
Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!
(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
Why did you disguise yourself as Detective Goodman?
(So that really was why Goodman started filling out that lost item report.)
(The ID card I found was left there by Officer Marshall!)
(So it opened because a rubber glove was stuck in the door by chance...? Then Detective Goodman must have opened the locker before Officer Marshall!)
Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!
(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
You pulled a knife on Officer Meekins and tried to drive him off?
(When did Edgeworth get so much influence...?)
By the way, what happened to your knife?
... (I don't know what to say...)
Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!
(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
So you did your research beforehand.
What was Officer Meekins doing during that time?
Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!
(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
But the blood found at the scene certainly indicates a crime took place!
(Detective Goodman's locker was already empty... Someone else stole the evidence!)
Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!
(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
But that case was solved two years ago, wasn't it?
(Why is he so concerned with that incident? Maybe I should present him with what I think his real reason is...)
Leads to:
(I had a feeling we'd wind up here sooner or later... Everyone involved here is related in some way to that case... I'd better take another look at the files.)
Officer Marshall, I think I understand. I think I know why you care so much about the SL-9 Incident.
I have the SL-9 Incident file here. The name "Marshall" is mentioned in here...
in a list of murder victims. "Neil Marshall"... Are you related to this man?
(He must be talking about the King of Prosecutors award.)
Disguising himself as Detective Goodman, he entered the evidence room. Officer Meekins confronted him, so he rendered him unconscious and fled.
!
(Chance...? It's got to be more than just that...)
B-but wait! A verdict wasn't reached in yesterday's trial!
But...!
... ARRRGHHHH!!!
(There's no doubt what I proved today is true... The apparent murder on the security camera's tape really was fake! But I didn't realize... that would end up proving Lana guilty!)
Ema!
What do you mean, "right?"
Your Honor! Oh, uh... in a sense...
(Now that she mentions it... the names of both Skye sisters were in that file.)
! So did you find something?
Huh?
...
Um... Is that all?
(And I'm just an attorney...)
Me? Oh boy...
Um...
Y-yes, Your Honor. (If ever I've needed to concentrate, it's now! What could be wrong with that handprint on Detective Gumshoe's locker? Could there be something I'm missing...?)
Leads to:
(I've got to be honest... I don't see anything wrong with it! Still... If I give up now, Lana's going to be convicted for sure...)
Leads to:
This handprint left at the crime scene... clearly shows a contradiction!
... (Yes, this is strange...!) Take a good look at these floor plans. Something is missing.
Yes. Something that, when drawn, will completely change the meaning of the blood mark!
(With all this evidence here... there's got to be something I can use!)
Leads to:
Marshall:
(It's no use! The more evidence there is, the more wrong choices!)
(What is it that bothers me about this blood mark..?) Please allow me another chance, Your Honor. I'll prove it this time!
The Blue Badger! Mascot of the police force! Defender of truth, guardian of proof!
Please look at the floor plans of the crime scene. The Blue Badger is not here.
So watch what happens when we put him in. This is where he was dancing at the time of the crime. Well...?
That's right. So long as the Blue Badger is dancing here... it would be impossible... to place a handprint at this spot on the locker!
It means it can't be done!
Don't look at me, I didn't put it there!
Ema!
...! So that must mean this blood mark... was left there before the Blue Badger was brought in...?
It may sound farfetched, Your Honor... but it's the only possible explanation! On February 21st... in the Police Department's evidence room... blood was spilled not once, but twice!
One time was captured on this tape, taken by the security camera. Officer Meekins cut his hand, from which a trivial amount of blood fell. The problem is... the "other" time. Someone bled prior to the struggle shown on this tape. It had to have been... Detective Goodman, when he was really murdered!
The murder portrayed in the security tape has been proven to be a fake. However! That does not explain the blood mark found on the locker!
(When did the first incident occur...)
The blood mark on the locker proves this.
(Proof that shows when the murder took place... There's only one piece of evidence that can show that!)
Leads to:
This is the proof! It's quite simple, you see.
... Huh?
Don't we have a time chart among our evidence items that lists the time?
If the crime took place inside the evidence room, then the perpetrator would had to have entered the room. In order to do so, an ID card is required.
Officer Meekins brought the Blue Badger panel into the evidence room at...
That means... the blood from the first crime was wiped away... by the real murderer.
Let's look at the chart again. There's only one other card number remaining: "7777777"!
Since there's no record of his card being used beforehand... he must have entered along with the real murderer. That's the only plausible explanation. He went in with "7777777"!
What!?
But that's ridiculous! Just how...
An "official charge"...
(L-Lana?)
...!
(Sounds like everyone's heard about these killings but me...)
What do you mean, "what happened" to you?
But what did you have to do with those killings, Ema?
What? He tried to kill you!?
So that means you...
(I didn't see that one coming!)
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Oh, right, evidence law. So, did you learn anything?
Oh...
(Oddly enough I find myself identifying with her on this one...)
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases.
(If that's what they're teaching in high school math, we're in serious trouble.)
Right. A few days before he was murdered, he had filed a lost item report. (Although "stolen item" is more like it... Swiped by that lone wolf who dressed up like him.)
It didn't come as much of a surprise to me...
There was something strange about this shoe, wasn't there? Let's see, what was it...?
But we did find blood on the floor somewhere, didn't we? Where was that again...?
That's right. We now know the other numbers aren't related to the murder. "7777777"... An "executive officer."
Uh, I believe that's one "seven" too many... (We can't find out whose number this is unless we have some incriminating evidence. That's going to be hard to dig up by tomorrow...)
Are you okay, Ema?
...
(Might as well wipe my dignity away too while you're at it.)
This screwdriver was at Edgeworth's office, wasn't it?
... Then what are we doing carrying it around?
(If I recall... Edgeworth said Chief Gant asked him to take this to the Prosecutor's Office.)
This jar's pretty fragile.
What do you mean, "about to"? It's already broken.
(This piece was found in Detective Goodman's evidence locker. That means...)
This fingerprint was left on the locker when Marshall was stashing his bloody coat.
Nope. Just that of an overly zealous patrolman.
(I wonder what's going to happen to Officer Marshall now...)
At first I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be a goldmine of evidence.
It also gave the Blue Badger some publicity... of the negative sort, that is.
It seems everything is somehow related to this incident.
Yes. The name of everyone connected to this trial is listed in here. All that's left... is to figure out just what role everyone plays in this case. If we search hard enough, I think we'll find our answers. (What exactly did, or didn't, Lana do?)
(I guess we're not the only ones who want to question her...)
Uh... Let's not and say we did. (I'd rather come back and do that later.)
No one's here today... Not even Ms. Starr.
But we proved in court today that no one was murdered in the evidence room at 5:15 PM, on the day of the crime.
But instead it looks like we just ended up making Lana look even more guilty.
(I've got to find all the answers by tomorrow!)
It sure helped us knock a hole in that testimony yesterday. Come to think of it, this divider helped our case more than the actual witness.
It's just a wall. (Scientifically speaking...)
Yup, it's pretty red alright. (The body was found in Edgeworth's car trunk... And the lock on the trunk was broken. So, the question is why did Ms. Skye chose his car?)
... I think it was called a "Sedan" or a "Coupe." Something like that.
(Maybe it is about time I got my driver's license...)
"2/21 SL-9"... The SL-9 Incident.
The Joe Darke Killings. (Everyone in this case played some part in that incident. This has to be more than just sheer coincidence!)
Maybe he's being questioned by an inquiry committee? (He took a real beating in court today...)
I guess we'll just have to come back later.
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "To be or not to be -- Wendy" ("Wendy?" ... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "To every cloud, there is a silver lining. -- Wendy"
I guess you would feel... important.
(There's a 0.0002% chance you'd live?)
Must be his pet cactus. Say, where are you headed?
Before you turn yourself in, Mr. Marshall... would you mind telling us exactly what happened?
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's dancing. (Speaking of "dancing"... The whole Police Department has been dancing about like crazy since the other day...)
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
They make a good pair.
What do you mean, "fishy"?
The murder weapon? You mean... that switchblade knife with the broken tip?
What does that mean?
...!
(Could the facts have been concealed with forged evidence...?)
The... "highest honor"? You don't mean...
(Not that again...)
(Mr. Marshall must have really been close with his brother.)
...! Interesting...
(Apparently someone tried to stop you. Detective Goodman was murdered... and the evidence locker was empty.)
What about Detective Goodman?
"They"...?
After the case ended, Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office, right?
(Now that he mentions it, Ema said something like that too...)
(Lana's "secret"... It all started two years ago.)
It was certainly... enlightening.
I don't see Detective Gumshoe anywhere.
You're right. (The head of the department seems the same though.)
Right. We can come back here later.
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
That man must be the Head Detective. He's staring at the screen so hard it might shatter.
(Now there's a guy who cares about his work...)
Joe Darke...
(Jake Marshall's brother...)
What happened?
(A permanent picture...?)
So you weren't able to testify about that? No, I was only asked about when I was attacked. That must be why Lana... why she "made up" the crime.
Made it up? You mean, provided bogus evidence?
Edgeworth!?
(So it's true. Even though he may not have known it... Edgeworth really was involved in falsifying evidence!)
(She must not have been able to face up to what she did... Especially not to Ema.)
What did you see in the instant that crime occurred?
(Neil Marshall was stabbed right in front of this poor girl!)
Poor Ema... You've been through so much.
Two years ago... You must have been 14. That's understandable.
I see... (I think I'm finally starting to understand what makes Ema tick. But there's still something that bothers me about that crime.)
There's something that's puzzling me, Ema.
You said you were in Lana's office at that time, right?
Why then would a serial killer come running in there?
Not only that, but he was being chased by a prosecutor?
Taken in for questioning? You mean by the police?
But why did he run all the way over to your sister's office?
... Across from the elevator? But Lana was the Chief Prosecutor, wasn't she?
Whaaaaat!? (That's news to me!)
(Lana used to be... a detective? I'd better have another talk with her!)
Falsifying evidence... I didn't think you were the type.
Lana. Ema told me about you.
About how you were a detective two years ago, and how the SL-9 Incident was the reason for your transfer to the Prosecutor's Office.
Could you fill me in on the details? Especially about that unusual change of jobs.
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in place, cowering under this room's oppressive atmosphere.
(She really means it...)
A lot of revelations were uncovered at the trial today, not the least of which was the fact that this case is largely connected to another one, two years ago.
Well, all drama aside, the fact of the matter is at 5:15, there was no murder at the Police Department.
(I don't think I've ever seen Lana look so fazed before...)
Chief Gant?
(Ema really idolizes her big sister.) But now you're Chief Prosecutor... What happened?
(Maybe I should ask more about this "investigation" of theirs two years ago.)
"Second-in-command"? That means the Chief Detective was, no doubt, Damon Gant?
(They even had the same office...!)
(When he tried to murder Ema...)
...! (Now you tell us...)
So you were the first person to run to the scene, Lana?
Three bodies? Prosecutor Marshall, the victim, Ema, who had passed out,
What did you do?
(Can't blame her, after all her sister must have gone through.)
Let me get this straight. You were all involved in the SL-9 Incident?
I don't buy it.
There's no way everyone involved in this trial was also involved in that incident just by "chance."
At least one person went to extremes because they didn't believe it was truly solved.
That "case" just might not be over yet.
Ema was assaulted by Darke at the Police Department, right?
(Maybe we should have a look at the Chief's office - the site of the final SL-9 murder!)
This place is always pretty empty, but today it's deserted.
Uh... thanks. (Wow, he actually talked to us!)
(I think "festive" is the word usually used for those...)
(Now I see where Detective Gumshoe gets his unique charm...)
Whoa... Where am I?
Check out that pipe organ. That's real, isn't it?
Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
Uh... no, I haven't. I've been kind of busy lately.
"Provocative statement"... oh, you mean about the forged evidence.
(So this is Mr. Marshall's brother... Prosecutor Neil Marshall...)
... (Something's not right with this picture. I can't quite seem to put my finger on it though...)
All the same, we'd still like to have a look around.
...!
It seems that case isn't over with yet, after all.
Chief Gant denied our request to search the "crime scene." That means there must be a reason he doesn't want us looking around in there.
(There's got to be a way we can get inside the Chief's office...)
Detective Gumshoe! Were you in a meeting?
(Sounds like Detective Gumshoe's still out of the loop...)
Edgeworth? No. Why do you ask?
That sounds serious...
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... I think it's way past time for that.
That man must be the Head Detective. He's staring at the screen so hard it might shatter.
(So much for "duty"...)
But why would Edgeworth be blamed? It's not like he knew the evidence was forged! Lana Skye is the guilty party here, isn't she?
It seems you don't have any problem with enemies.
(He seems geniunely concerned for Edgeworth...) Well? Did you find out anything?
His final attack? You mean...
(It seems Detective Gumshoe never realized Ema was the girl...)
(His powers of recollection never fail to impress.)
A businessman? What made him take to serial killing?
Seems he was a pretty careless animal.
So, he turned himself in...
(That last "witness"... He must mean Ema...)
This knife... it was Joe Darke's, wasn't it?
!
Did it match Darke's knife?
It's only scary because you keep dropping your card, Detective Gumshoe.
(I think I'll stay out of this conversation.)
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Ah... congratulations.
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
This guy almost made us lose the case today.
(I have to admit he's right though... Thanks to the Blue Badger, we were able to prove another possibility today: The possibility that another murder took place prior to 5:15 PM...)
Um, about this...
It has a tag attached to it, with the label "SL-9 Incident" on it. I believe this would be the broken "murder weapon" you were speaking of?
"Base height"? Hey, let me see that! "Looming Tall." "New and improved growth formula."
Yes. There's only one number left to investigate. At 4:20 PM... the victim, Detective Goodman, must have entered the evidence room along with someone else. Someone with an "executive officer" number:
That's one "seven" too many, Detective. (An executive officer. Hmm... I just might have a hunch.)
Are you okay, Detective?
...
(Why am I not comforted?)
(Maybe I shouldn't let Ema hold any evidence...)
(The handprint of the real murderer's gloved hand... without any fingerprints...)
If that happens, I think you'll do better pleading with Edgeworth.
"Somewhere"?
(This must be the most uninformative detective I've ever met...)
(Chief Gant?)
(But Lana was pretty clear in her confession. She forged evidence in order to prove Joe Darke guilty.)
I'll, uh, keep that in mind.
Can I ask you one more thing?
It's not money, but it does concern the Chief. His office is a "crime scene," right? It's where Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered...
Oh...
(So in other words, Gumshoe is our only chance of getting into that office.)
(I wonder if Edgeworth is back yet.)
(He sure was quick to throw that paper on the floor...) Tough day in court, huh?
(That's Edgeworth for you... Always trying to hide his real feelings.)
Better this than that giant Steel Samurai.
What is it?
Of course it is. You know that!
Something that looked like that?
(She's right. Something's amiss here. Maybe I should show him a certain item...)
(I wonder what he was writing before?)
Are you crazy? Edgeworth is sitting right there!
Uh... Hey, Edgeworth. Is that Detective Gumshoe out the window there? Oh no! He's falling to the ground!!!
(He didn't even look.)
"Resignation"!? Edgeworth, you don't mean...?
(Uh oh. I think he's serious!)
(This Letter of Resignation... I wonder if I can use it for anything?)
But you didn't know, did you? I mean, that the evidence was falsified.
(Even Edgeworth can't keep this kind of emotion bottled up...)
Are you up for the trial tomorrow?
What do you mean?
It's only half as long as most lists? (That is odd...)
(That picture... Something seemed strange about it...)
Could you tell us again about what happened that day? The day Detective Goodman was murdered? You were participating in a ceremony over at the station, right?
You, "finished up" at the office?
(That's the story we heard yesterday...) So you came back here to the Prosecutor's Office because the Chief asked you to?
...
Me? Oh, uh... sure. Everyone knows that! Why don't you tell it though... for Ema's sake.
Hmm... Wait a minute.
Those claims contradict each other!
That's funny... If that's so, then why were you only given a shield?
(Chief Gant...)
You know, it wouldn't hurt if you put this up somewhere, like on a shelf.
What do you mean, "anymore"?
He's asking me?
Different...?
(I guess I'd better present this other shield...)
Hey, don't look at me.
Did you notice anything amiss when you were in the evidence room?
But this isn't related to the case, remember? You said so yourself.
(A certain detective comes to mind...)
This picture was hanging on the wall in Chief Gant's office.
Remember what?
(Sounds interesting.) Would you mind telling it to us?
Edgeworth...
(Uh oh. I think he's serious!)
(This Letter of Resignation... I wonder if I can use it for anything?)
I'll pass on the tea. Just tell me about the case...
(Whoose side are you on, anyway? Maybe if I just show him my best evidence I can get some reaction out of him.)
(He really wrote a resignation letter...)
Someone has to be held responsible. That's how it is in the grown-up world.
Well, not everyone sees it that way.
(Sometimes the "grown-up" world can be tough...)
Ms. Starr! (I guess she's out of lunches.)
Everyone in this trial was involved in the SL-9 Incident. Not only that, but the murder occurred on the very day the evidence from that case was due for transferal. This can't all be attributed to mere "coincidence."
(The instant Lana stabbed Detective Goodman with a knife.)
(Ms. Starr's hatred toward Lana... It all dates back to two years ago!)
You mean, because of his brother's death?
"Her"...?
You mean, with the forging of the evidence?
She was being used?
His "magnetism"?
("Incredible evidence"? You mean...)
(I take it she's talking about forged evidence.)
Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office two years ago, didn't she?
What? You mean... That's why Lana was transferred!?
(At last... I'm finally getting close to the bottom of this ugly mess.) Thank you, Ms. Starr.
(Talk about cheap...)
You're still here?
If I'm not mistaken, I think he means "Desk Jockey."
(That office is the last crime scene in the SL-9 Incident. I have to take a look in there!)
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... It seems he's given up on the mystery genre.
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Ah... congratulations.
That's not exactly the version we heard.
Is he ever not serious?
We can't do that. If someone found out...
(What...?)
All right, Detective. Thank you.
Whatever you do, just don't say that to his face.
Yeah... and his mouth is half open.
And he's got the narrow end of his tie in front. ... I think this goes beyond being a "photogenic" issue.
Detective Gumshoe's a goner.
AAAAH! Detective Gumshoe! What are you doing sneaking up on us like that!?
If you're here, then what's the point in giving us your ID card!?
(I've got a bad feeling about this...)
Uh, this is the 15th floor.
(Saying what?)
So long as he doesn't go crashing through that window when he gets fired.
These shelves are mostly empty. Lana must have cleaned them out when she transferred over to the Prosecutor's Office. There's a small picture frame on the left shelf.
(The day Joe Darke ran out of the questioning room and tried to kill Ema...)
(Gee, you think?)
This was Lana's desk. It sure is tidy.
There's not even any dust on it! Looks like someone's still keeping it clean. Does Lana ever come back here?
(Does he keep it in memory of her, or in memory of the crime...?)
(That's on the 2nd floor, and this is the 15th!)
(So it's an instrument of punishment... literally.)
(That's besides the point...)
"Prosecutor's badge"...?
What!? They have badges too!?
But Mr. Edgeworth never wears a badge.
(I don't see how that's supposed to signify severe punishment...)
This is a safe, isn't it?
Uh, okay. If you say so...
(A seven-digit number. I think I just might know what it is...)
(I'm not sure what will happen if we enter the wrong code. I'd better wait until I find something more definite.)
I have a hunch...
(I have a better idea. Here goes nothing.)
I was so sure that was the number!
(A seven-digit number...)
Bingo.
"7777777." The final ID card number on that record.
The number of the mysterious "executive officer" who entered the room that day.
I think you're one "seven" shy this time. This can only mean one thing: That's Chief Gant's ID number!
(This somehow looks familiar. Where have I seen this before...?)
What's this? It looks like a piece of leather cloth...
Apparently so. It's empty now.
They look like pieces of evidence,
(Great. Now I have to prove their "relevancy" to get them. How are these two items related to the SL-9 Incident?)
This is a safe, isn't it?
Uh, okay. If you say so...
(Speaking of that, when we were here earlier...)
Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
I wonder what he was reading?
A list of evidence?
Hold on, Detective! What did you just say?
No, about evidence lists. Normally they're twice as long?
(A half-sized list of evidence...)
(What would the other half of the list be doing here?)
It would appear so.
We found this inside the drawer. A list of evidence from the SL-9 Incident.
(What would this list be doing here...? We'd better look a little more into this list.)
This is the real deal, isn't it? This armor and these weapons?
First the pipe organ, now this armor... Do you know how many taxpayer dollars must have gone into this room?
(You don't have any taxes to pay.)
I don't think he'd fit in there.
(Stained glass or not, it's a huge window...)
That desk on the other side of the room... Was that your sister's?
Is anyone using it now?
(That's a strange reason to leave it there...)
I see.
(Still, two years have passed since that incident. There can't possibly be any clues remaining.)
Sure.
... Why do you ask?
Okay. Now then, let's look around a bit more.
Huh? What is it?
S-sorry. (This guy's starting to get on my nerves.) Okay, so what's bothering you?
(Chief Gant... So it's finally come to this. What do I think of him? Perhaps it's best I don't divulge my feelings... yet.)
This knife belonged to the murdered, Joe Darke, right?
(Ever since that case was solved, this knife's been in Detective Goodman's locker. How could it have possibly gotten to Mr. Edgeworth's car?)
Detective Gumshoe. I'd like you to have a look at this.
What are you doing? Why are you sticking out your hand like that?
Come on, this isn't the time for jokes. We're talking about that cloth we found in the safe!
(What are you, my mom? I don't have to be told a million times.) All right, let's get this over with!
Hmm... I gave it my best shot.
But it doesn't look like we'll get a clearer result from this print.
It looks like we're out of clues this time.
Right, along with that shard.
(The one that happened right here in this room... She's right! We should check the fingerprints of everyone who was in here that day!)
(No... How can this be!? What are Ema's fingerprints doing here!?)
Huh? Oh, uh... it seems the prints are too old. They aren't clear enough to get a match.
Don't ask me! Let's just keep this information from Ema for now.
"Here"? You mean, in the Chief's office?
Your telepathy...
Oh yeah.
Detective Gumshoe. Could you have another look at this jar?
(It's kind of early to be nostalgic.)
Doesn't this ring any bells? You know, that fragment we just found?
Maybe we shouldn't do this right now.
(It's hard to imagine Detective Gumshoe had a childhood.)
Here, let me see that shard. I'll take a crack at this.
(If I can piece this together again... it'll prove Chief Gant was knowingly hiding evidence! Here goes...)
I don't get it! This piece doesn't fit anywhere in this jar!
Well, I need a breather. I'll try it again later.
There! It fits like a charm. That of course means... Chief Gant willingly and knowingly hid a piece of this jar in his safe.
In other words, he concealed a piece of evidence from the SL-9 Incident.
What is it?
(A reddish line... That's blood!)
(I have a feeling the outcome of tomorrow's trial just might hinge on this...)
Yeah. It looks like the right side of the form's been torn off.
(The back...?)
What is this strip of cloth, anyway?
It seems this is becoming a habit with you.
(Ema's fingerprints were found on this cloth. I have a bad feeling about this...)
Is this from that incident?
(So a murder really did take place here.)
Hmm... Looks like blood.
(That is odd...)
I wonder what this is? (It looks like someone drew some kind of sketch here!)
(I can't make it out. I'd better keep quiet about it for now.) Huh? Oh. No, it's nothing.
(I'd better not forget about this picture!)
Yeah. Someone left behind an oil stain on the fabric. Whoever it was, they must have had a really oily hand.
Huh?
Well, that would account for this amount of oil I guess. (I don't see what's so "scientific" about it though.)
Of course! Thanks to your ID card, we were able to get some hard evidence.
We didn't think you'd be back so soon.
We'll be on our way too, then.
The dark red stains must be blood traces from the incident two years ago. Only the fragment found in Chief Gant's office still has lines remaining on it.
A picture is drawn on the back of the evidence list in magic marker. I've got a very bad feeling about this...
A clear handprint can be seen on the leather cloth. The print belongs to Ema... I think I'll keep this information to myself.
I thought you said you didn't care anymore if you were fired.
(Now that I've seen the evidence Chief Gant was hiding in his office... I think I'm finally starting to get the picture... It's hard to believe anyone could keep quiet about it all this time...)
After that, I heard from Ema. She said the police want to ask her some questions, so she'll be busy for the rest of the day...
It's no use thinking about it. Tomorrow's the final day in court. I'm committed to doing everything I can to defend you, which is why I'm here.
What you've told me over these past couple of days... is absolutely nothing. Not a single, useful thing.
You know, I think I've finally figured it out... Who it is you're hiding behind those words.
!
Edgeworth...?
(Now's my chance to get her to tell me the rest of the story!)
I have to admit I was more than a little perplexed at first. You insisted you "did it," yet there was no incriminating evidence. That's when it hit me. It's not that you're unwilling to tell the truth, it's that you're incapable of doing so, because of a certain individual.
Protecting? No. I think "afraid of" is more like it.
If I'm not mistaken, the person in question may have persuaded you to silence.
Leads to:
The person whom you fear... is this!
W-who would that be?
Me?
I, uh...
(If you ask me, you're the scary one...)
Well, Ms. Skye?
(I take it she's still not ready to spill the beans.)
Assuming he is respectable, then tell me something... Why would he try to hide his crimes?
Both you and Edgeworth will be brought before a board of inquiry for what you did. Specifically, hiding and forging evidence.
Why is it, though, that Chief Gant's name was never mentioned?
Edgeworth didn't know the truth behind the forgery. The only party who could have possible investigated that evidence was...
Yes you, but also one other: Damon Gant.
Leads to:
You want proof of the Chief's wrongdoings? Here it is!
W-who would that be?
Me?
I, uh...
(If you ask me, you're the scary one...)
I just found this in a safe in the Chief's office. This jar piece, and this strip of cloth. Do you know what these are? They're pieces of evidence from the SL-9 Incident!
The person concealing evidence was none other than Chief Gant himself. Now tell me! Why are you taking all the blame for him!?
Why not?
(In the murder of Detective Goodman!)
Just as I suspected. Despite what everyone believes... you were not the one who murdered Detective Goodman!
The murder weapon... You mean, Edgeworth's knife?
(The knife from the SL-9 Incident... serial killer Joe Darke's knife!)
That would be Edgeworth's knife?
And that is the reason for the bandage on your right hand?
(Ms. Starr...) Why did you need to hide Darke's knife so badly?
(Showing evidence isn't going to do me any good now. I've got to get Lana to tell me everything she's hiding!)
I need to hear what Lana has to say. Then I can finish up the investigation.
So... you hid Darke's knife?
So you wrapped the knife in your scarf, and hid it. In Edgeworth's exhaust pipe...
You asked Ema?
(That would explain why Ema is so confident... about Lana's innocence!)
A bad feeling?
To Marshall? Why on earth would you call him?
Oh! You mean...
(He disguised himself as Officer Goodman and tried to steal the evidence!)
So your phone call caused the incident in the evidence room!?
But Lana...
(Tomorrow's trial... There's only one way to drive off Lana's demons...)
(I've got to get to the bottom of everything! Detective Goodman's real murderer... and what went down in the Chief's office two years ago...)
(This is the Defendant Lobby all right... but there's no defendant. I've been trying to reach Lana all morning. Where could she be? And where's Ema, for that matter? It almost seems as if...)
Edgeworth!
Well... I have a pretty strong hunch. (Looks like I'm not the only one who's figured it out.)
True... Not yet.
But she didn't do it!
(This is the first time he's ever done something like this...) Lana's hiding something, and the only way we'll ever know the truth... is to draw it out of her.
Everything goes back to the SL-9 Incident.
That depends on you.
If she's found guilty, you'll lose your only chance to find out what really happened.
(This is it. If I'm ever going to find out what Chief Gant has on her, it's now!)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Chief Gant...!)
(She wants to do what!?)
Huh!?
No, Lana!
You can't! Your Honor. The defendant's claim does not change the defense's plea!
But Lana!
(This can't be happening!)
...
(Looks like Edgeworth has decided to take the horse by the reins!)
(He sure gave in fast...)
(The trip to yesteryear has finally begun... It's bound to lead to the truth behind this trial!)
(You've got to admire him for his courage, considering he has no evidence...)
Two years ago, the defendant was a detective at the Police Department, correct?
A "man"...?
What was the prosecutor doing there?
(Gant was there too...?)
And that's when Prosecutor Marshall came running in?
Can you tell us about that?
So the electricity went out?
The detective?
(Detective Bruce Goodman... The victim...)
(Poor Ema. These memories are really torturing her. She's been through enough already.) Thank you, Ema. You don't have to go into that.
So you spoke with Detective Goodman about this... two years ago.
(A picture... Yes, I think she mentioned that before.)
(Poor Ema. These memories are really torturing her. She's been through enough already.) Thank you, Ema. You don't have to go into that.
The picture the witness drew... I believe it has a very important meaning.
You drew a picture of the scene you witnessed, right?
(This picture that Ema drew... that reminds me! I guess I should check the evidence again...)
Leads to:
That must have been a real shock.
(Ema doesn't have any reason to lie... but Lana sure does. I need to get Ema to tell me as much about this as she can!)
Mr. Edgeworth. This little girl put all her heart into drawing that picture... and yet you still insist on denying its existence?
That may well be... but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Behold!
Please turn it over, Your Honor.
Me...?
So you see, Mr. Edgeworth. It's quite obvious what happened. Two years ago... only half of the evidence in that case ever reached you.
(Wait a minute... If this list was torn in half, then that means...) Your Honor!
If the evidence list was torn in half... then there might be more of the drawing on the back of Mr. Edgeworth's list!
(Do you even have to ask?)
(I guess he was out of scrap paper...)
(What's wrong with Ema? She seemed to be thinking about something when she saw the picture.)
(Thanks to that though, she was able to show us exactly what she saw!)
Did you draw this picture right after the incident?
(Two or three days later... The memory should still have been fresh in her mind.)
So at the time you didn't even know it was Mr. Marshall who had come to your rescue?
You were knocked to the floor?
(Poor Ema... I'm just glad she wasn't hurt.)
You mean, you didn't see the actual murder take place?
What!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy here!
Sorry for asking so many times, but are you sure you drew exactly what you saw?
It wasn't influenced in any way from your talks with the detectives?
No, no. Of course not. (I'd better watch out, or he might find some way to cut my salary!)
Huh? Oh, well...
Leads to:
(That's strange... She claims this is exactly the scene that was imprinted in her mind... And yet... There's clearly a contradiction here!)
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this picture the witness drew... contains a blatant contradiction!
Leads to:
Um, I think it's... uh, this part here?
That's because the drawing stinks!
(I guess he means I shouldn't shift the blame to others...)
(I'd better take another look at that autopsy report and this picture!)
The contradiction of course lies here! Take a look at the knife the man is holding. If you look closely, you can see its tip is broken!
I'm afraid it's not so simple, Ema.
It's obvious, really. The victim "suffered a single stab wound in the back." If the victim was only stabbed once, then the murder weapon should not yet be broken!
Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not possible. The tip of the knife was found inside the victim's body. If it was broken beforehand, it couldn't possibly wind up there!
That's why I asked her so many times if she was sure she remembered correctly. I believe you were annoyed at the time. But she was sure she remembered correctly!
Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth. There is another explanation. Have you forgotten already? About a little something called... "falsified evidence"?
All I'm saying, is that this broken knife might be the piece of evidence that was forged! You can't deny the possibility!
Your Honor... Please allow me to once again go over the events that took place the day of the murder. The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office were holding a ceremony that day. After receiving the King of Prosecutors award at the ceremony. Neil Marshall questioned Joe Darke along with Damon Gant. During his questioning, Joe Darke fled the room. Prosecutor Marshall chased after him... and was killed by Darke. It is my belief that somewhere in this story... there is a lie.
...!
(Another broken knife besides Joe Darke's... Could there have been one?)
(Broken knives don't just grow on trees... There's no way there was another one!)
Your Honor, I believe... the witness must be mistaken.
...! (That flash of lightning burned an unforgettable image in her mind... One that's been torturing her ever since! There's no way Ema could be mistaken!)
If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw... it can't just be explained away by a simple observational error.
In that instant... Ema really did see a broken knife!
(The murder weapon was already broken prior to the murder... There's only one way!) Take a look at this. Here's the real murder weapon!
Leads to:
Edgeworth:
Huh?
S-sorry, Your Honor. Please give me another chance.
The answer lies in the past... Two years in the past. Right here inside this picture!
Notice the award Prosecutor Marshall is holding.
As we earlier concluded, the knife in the picture was not Joe Darke's knife. That being the case... the knife the witness saw, was in all likelihood this award!
Neil Marshall was awarded King of Prosecutors that day. As an award, he was given this broken shield and a broken knife. When he chased after Joe Darke, he pulled out this knife. Being a prosecutor, he did not carry a pistol. This broken knife was the only weapon he had in this dangerous situation.
Oh? And why not, Mr. Edgeworth?
What do you mean?
Oh... OOOOOHHHHH!!!
That's true... (What's going on here?)
You drew that?
(First the knife mix-up, and now... the Blue Badger? This should be interesting...)
(That would mean he didn't even exist two years ago...)
Lana!
(It seems we're finally getting to the core of the matter.)
When you say, "that man," I assume you refer to Joe Darke?
You... "think"?
Why would you do something so dangerous!?
(She seems so convinced that Darke was the one holding the knife...)
What do you mean, you "think"?
Are you sure about this?
(Oh, brother. Just when you thought that thing had caused enough commotion...)
Leads to:
His shadow? So you mean, you didn't actually see his face, with its winning smile and all?
That may well be... but what's important is what caused her to think she saw what she did.
(What was it Ema saw when that lightning flashed? Who is this "Blue Badger" really...?)
I absolutely and positively have no idea whatsoever!
Ema...
(The Blue Badger hadn't even been dreamed up when Ema drew this picture. Yet she's certain she saw its "shadow"!) Ladies and gentlemen... It is the defense's belief that on that fateful day two years ago... there indeed was something that looked similar to the Blue Badger... Something that is now sitting in this very room!
Leads to:
Behold! In her confusion, the witness mistook this for the Blue Badger!
Huh?
Oh. Uh, give me a second here... (I'd better take another look at the evidence... from every angle!)
Leads to:
(The Blue Badger didn't even exist two years ago... So what exactly did Ema see? I've gathered all the evidence. All that's left now... is to put the pieces of the puzzle together...)
The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!
I believe it's some sort of jar.
Indeed it doesn't. As it stands now, it's just a plain jar. However... What if we were to change our viewpoint?
(I've got to show them the correct angle to look at this from!)
Leads to:
(This isn't right... I've got to make it look more like the Badger!)
(I've got to find just the right angle! Maybe I should rotate it vertically a bit more... or horizontally...?)
Well...? Is this a miracle or what? No one can possibly deny this jar's resemblance to the Blue Badger!
What do you mean?
I'm afraid that's where you're wrong, Mr. Edgeworth. You see... this changes everything!
Allow me to take these in turn. At the moment of the murder, the witness saw this jar.
Knowing this, where could she have seen this jar?
The location of the jar is shown in a picture taken on the day of the crime. It's on a shelf in the office of Damon Gant.
Yes! And it is these two facts that reveal what actually transpired! You see... The struggle between Darke and Marshall did not take place in Lana Skye's office! It happened on the other side of the room, in Chief Gant's office!
Yes.
Exactly.
If there wasn't a "reason"... he wouldn't have gone through the trouble. The only logical conclusion... is that there was a "reason."
(I've finally figured it out... So this is why Lana tried to stop the trial! It's too late to quit now, though.) Please recall the witness's testimony. She said she knocked away the man who was holding up the knife. In the next instant, the jar was hit and flew threw the air. Now tell me... What could have sent the jar flying?
Ladies and gentlemen... if I may draw your attention to this picture once more. If the man was knocked in the direction of the shelf the jar was sitting on... what would he have hit?
Yes. And since the man who was knocked into the armor was carrying a broken knife... he would have had to have been Neil Marshall, wielding the Prosecutor's Award.
Yes. There is another possibility of what actually transpired in that room.
Of course the perpetrator would have had no idea, but nevertheless! ... (I... I don't know if I can go through with this...)
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye, but given the circumstances...
E-evidence?
...! (We certainly can't get dead people to testify. This has all been a wild goose chase from the beginning!)
...! (You mean, there's still another possibility?)
(I've got to think back to the Court Record!) The real murderer's name that the victim may have left behind...
(No... There's no way a dead person could tell the murderer's name!)
My feelings...?
(Perhaps that thing really is the clue I'm looking for. This is it. I can't afford any more mistakes.)
This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession.
Leads to:
This is the message from the deceased!
Oh... (I guess that wasn't right. If a dead person left behind a message... it would have to be in written form. That's the only logical conclusion.)
This is the message left by the deceased.
(Looks like everyone's forgotten this is just a jar.) A message was left here... on the surface of this jar.
If you look closely, you can see a faint trail of blood on this jar.
Yes, but notice: for some reason... the blood on some of the fragments was not wiped away.
Prosecutor Marshall did not die instantly. He used the few precious moments left to him to leave behind a message!
Precisely so! All we need to do is connect these points... and the victim's message will become apparent!
Your Honor... I believe these blood stains will reveal to us the answer! (I've got to connect these dots to make letters. There's only one thing the victim would have written, given the circumstances: The murderer's name!)  
Leads to:
What do you think!? I came up with this message!
(I never was much good at handwriting... I guess I'll check the court record...)
(It's a defense attorney's duty to prove his client's innocence. That's why all I've been thinking about is saving Lana. After all my efforts, I never thought it would turn out like this!)
was Ema Skye.
But Joe Darke really was a serial murderer! That's undeniable!
What?
The gavel's pounding fell on deaf ears... Unable to settle the crowd, the judge declared a recess. Where this trial is headed, no one knows...
Sorry, Edgeworth. I didn't mean to get you in trouble...
...
Oh, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
I take it Lana's having you run errands again.
"Evidence Law"? (Edgeworth was talking about this just the other day...)
It seems so.
A message?
("Him"... I guess I'll need to give this book a thorough read...)
That's where you're wrong, Detective.
You're missing the point, Detective. Lana didn't murder Detective Goodman.
She merely stuck a knife into his dead body. That means the real killer...is still out there.
(And we're going to expose him... No matter what it takes! This case has hurt too many people. It's time to bring it to an end!)
...!
... (Unbelievable. Edgeworth has found a way to continue the trial!) Very well. The defense accepts the prosecution's proposal.
...!
The defense calls... (The time's finally come to bring out the real murderer!)
Leads to:
Edgeworth:
Huh?
(I still don't have any concrete evidence, but judging by the direction everything seems to be pointing... There's another person even more suspicious!)
Damon Gant. The defense calls Damon Gant to the stand!
... As the defendant's partner two years ago, Mr. Gant has first-hand knowledge of the crime. I feel we should hear what he has to say about it.
Now then, Chief Gant. The court requests to hear your testimony.
First, let's clear up this SL-9 Incident.
There are still some things unaccounted for.
Like the role you played in all of this.
...
"Weapons"...?
What? Is that true?
(If the police chief has the right to refuse to testify... Then I'd better hit him hard and fast!)
As I recall... a ceremony was held at the Police Department that day...
So the two of you ran immediately after him, right?
(That's not funny...)
Could you tell us what you saw?
Darke was also lying collapsed on the floor?
(Lana and Ema...)
...!
How can you know that!?
Yes...
So you're saying... that the forgery had already taken place by the time you arrived at your office?
(Is that how it really went down?)
!
(But which piece of evidence ties Gant to the forgery...?)
You claim you had nothing to do with the forgery... but I'm afraid that is a claim you cannot back up.
Several pieces of evidence were found in your office. Take this jar, for example.
A piece of this jar was discovered in your safe.
Not only that, but the evidence list I presented earlier... was actually found inside your desk!
You claim you had nothing to do with the forgery... but I'm afraid that is a claim you cannot back up!
Several pieces of evidence were found in your office. Take this list, for example.
This was discovered in your desk.
Not only that, but a piece of this jar that was sitting in your office... was found inside your safe!
If you really had nothing to do with the forgery... then how do you explain this?
Chief Gant! Your explanation, please!
Huh?
(Uh-oh, not this again. Evidence law...)
(I guess it's too early to use this piece of evidence.)
(Yeah. Sorry I didn't nail you...)
(Lana did admit to forging evidence... but that can't be the whole truth. Somehow I've got to link Gant to the incident!)
You see, Chief Gant. These articles of evidence uncovered in your office... are both concrete proof... that you also played a part in the illegal investigation!
So you admit to it, then? That you were involved in the forgery?
Me? Why would I have anything to do with that!?
...!
WHAAAAT!? (If Detective Gumshoe's salary drops any further, he'll end up paying to work!)
Yes, Your Honor?
Ooh...
(Huh? What are these guys, telepathic?)
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop making these ridiculous allegations.
What!? I'll have you know, back in the day I once broke into a cattle ranch, and tipped-
Grrr... (I've never faced anyone as slimy as this guy!)
What do you mean by that?
If concealing evidence found at a crime scene isn't forgery...
Are you saying this jar fragment... wasn't discovered in the initial investigation?
Oh, and wouldn't that be convenient...
!
(Tell me something I don't know...)
How can you look me in the eye and say that!?
...!
...
Really, Chief Gant? At the very least, there is one very large benefit you've reaped from all this.
That would of course be the position you have- Chief of Police.
The resolution of the SL-9 Incident secured your promotion to Chief. That in itself is sufficient motive!
Huh?
What do you mean?
Is that true, Edgeworth?
Gah!
"Nothing in it" for you?
(Hmm... Could there have been something in it for him? Given his selfishness, would he have helped someone out?)
(Bah! I can't think of how it would help him! That means... He wouldn't have helped out anyone.)
!
Think outside the box... (I never thought I'd hear him tell me that... The question isn't "Who would the Chief help"... It's "Who would ask the Chief for help?" If someone did that, he'd be sure to find a way to benefit from that person!)
True, you might not help out anyone for their sake. But if it would benefit you... you might decide to assist someone.
(That's not what I mean...)
Leads to:
Gant:
(Chief Gant would have wanted something in return... He must have wanted to be able to blackmail the person he helped!)
(Gant isn't the one who murdered Prosecutor Marshall two years ago. Yet I know he played a part in the forgery. That can only mean someone asked him to be an accomplice.)
I believe it's quite obvious in light of the circumstances. Ema Skye fell victim to an unfortunate series of events. Who would want to help her more than her own sister, Lana? And as for Chief Gant... he would also have a reason to help Lana if she asked him to. That reason, of course, is... self profit.
After the SL-9 Incident was resolved... Lana Skye was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the Prosecutor's Office. The person who arranged this job change...was you, Chief Gant.
Admit it, Chief! You assisted Lana Skye in forging evidence! Your motive: to appoint her as Chief Prosecutor so you could control her!
What?
Lana... (She's keeping quiet to protect Ema. There's no way she'd testify against Gant!)
What he means, Your Honor, is that Chief Gant is involved in the murder of Detective Goodman. Not only that... but the Chief is now making Lana take the rap to cover up his involvement!
Huh?
... Your Honor, I was merely reiterating... what Mr. Edgeworth said, in easier-to-understand language.
!
(It looks like he's the one who's decided to go through with this.)
... (Good question...)
Leads to:
Judge:
(Oops... Looks like I got it wrong.)
(Now that he mentions it, we did find something out in yesterday's investigation... Something that proves Gant entered that room...)
...
Yes, the one that shows who entered the evidence room on the day of the crime. There was one ID on the list we couldn't determine the owner of yesterday... 7777777.
It's your number.
The safe in Chief Gant's Office requires a code to open. A seven-digit code...
I'm afraid so, Your Honor. The code was "7777777"... The same as the remaining ID card number on that list! Chief Gant! You entered the evidence room on the day of the crime!
Detective Goodman wouldn't have happened to be with you that day... would he?
You hadn't seen him... "in days"? Chief Gant... I'm afraid you've just undone yourself. On that day, you had to have met with Detective Goodman!
Leads to:
(No, there's got to be something more solid than this! On that day... Detective Goodman had to go see Chief Gant!)
(Oops...)
Regardless, you did see Detective Goodman that day!
Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime.
So Detective Goodman filled out a lost item report. He would have had to give that report... to the Chief of Police!
He filed it. How do I know, you ask? Because he needed to enter the evidence room that day.
Yes. To transfer the evidence out.
Detective Goodman took the form to you, Chief Gant. Then... you accompanied the detective to the evidence room!
There's no other way the murderer and Detective Goodman could have entered the room!
... Exactly.
The murder was most likely committed on the spur of the moment. No one in their right mind would choose the Police Department as a place to commit murder. After the murder, you contacted Lana at the Prosecutor's Office. Why else? To dispose of Detective Goodman's body.
Everyone except me, it seems... Still, you're the Chief of Police. You have an entire police force at your disposal.
Chief Gant. You left all the evidence we need... to prove how you moved the body to the Prosecutor's Office. (And all this time I thought it was a useless clue just taking up space...)
To move the victim's body... Chief Gant used this!
This is how he moved Detective Goodman's body!
The body was found in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car. I think it's obvious what happened. The body was moved by that car!
Precisely so.
But you did return! Tell me, why?
So you see... what you really took to the Prosecutor's Office wasn't the screwdriver... but the victim's body in your trunk!
This is how he moved Detective Goodman's body!
Mr. Edgeworth. Think back to the day of the crime. What is this screwdriver doing here?
But you did. Because Chief Gant asked you to.
The body was found in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car. I think it's obvious what happened. The body was moved by that car!
Well!?
Huh?
(Chief Gant stayed at the P.D. and Lana stayed at the Prosecutor's Office... That leaves only one possible way he could have moved the body. The only problem is, how did he get him to do it? Maybe that piece of evidence really did have something to do with this case!)
Yes. Unless, of course, you have another explanation, Chief? Why else would you have asked Mr. Edgeworth to carry evidence from a closed case?
There's only one plausible explanation: to transport the body to your accomplice... Ms. Lana Skye!
Think back to the photograph Ms. Starr took at the Prosecutor's Office. This was not a photo of the body being stuffed in the trunk to be taken away. It was exactly the opposite...
B-but... The cross-examination isn't finished yet!
..."Weapons"...?
Well I...
Y-Your Honor?
(Do I have any concrete "proof"...?)
(I can't let him just squirm his way out of this! I've got to keep the pressure on!) Yes, Your Honor. I do have such evidence.
Leads to:
It's proof. As to whether or not it's enough to demonstrate the Chief's guilt... I'll let you be the judge!
Oh, right... Well, what do you think, Your Honor?
(I guess it wasn't enough...) Please, Your Honor! Give me just a little longer to consider!
(It's no use showing evidence I'm not even sure of myself...) No, Your Honor. At present I have no conclusive evidence.
What?
... WAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
(A lady who knows the truth... Another witness!)
But Chief Gant has invoked his right to refuse to testify!
(She may not be willing to tell the truth... But we can't just stop now!) Yes, Your Honor! The defense calls forth...
Leads to:
Edgeworth:
(There's another "witness" who can expose Chief Gant's crime... One whom we've all let stand at the sidelines... Now that I think about it, there's only one possible person!)
She was in the underground parking lot at 5:15 PM on February 21. Her task: to dispose of the victim's body... in accordance with a certain someone's orders!
(He's talking to Lana!)
Ah! (This isn't good!)
Yeah. Thanks to your help, Edgeworth.
Detective Gumshoe!
Oh yeah. Sorry about that...
My office...?
(Could he mean... Maya?)
It's not fair he has the right to refuse to testify!
"Risks"... What did he mean by that?
Ema! Are you okay?
(So she heard everything that's been going on.) Um, Ema... I'm sorry for what I said before.
"Relieved"?
(That must be why she became so cold...)
I... I see.
Ema, why don't you wait h-
!
(Everything hinges on your testimony. You're the only chance we have to get Gant!)
(But what if she's telling the truth?)
...! (Yeah... This is no time to to start second-guessing myself!)
How many years, exactly?
(She must have been good, coming from the same school as Mia...)
But think about it, Ms. Skye! You didn't murder Detective Goodman! You told me as much yesterday in jail!
...!
Did you do so to help your sister?
But what she did was justifiable self-defense! She wouldn't have been charged with anything...
You say you did this all by yourself?
What!? But Prosecutor Marshall died from an unfortunate "accident"!
...!
(That's not how it went down! She's trying to cover up her lies with more lies!)
You planted the tip of Darke's knife in the victim's wound?
(My head isn't that bad... but maybe I ought to ask for the sake of the others...)
But why did you do that!?
When you showed up on the scene, where exactly was the victim's body?
According to your testimony, Prosecutor Marshall's broken knife was the murder weapon, right?
"Pieces of the jar..." You mean...?
What's the matter, Ema?
(There must be a contradiction here somewhere!)
Leads to:
So you rearranged the crime scene... Are you sure you didn't do this to keep Ema from looking like the "murderer"?
(Are you so desperate to hide that fact... you're willing to risk the death sentence?)
Looks like she's determined to protect you to the end. She insists she fabricated the evidence by herself.
(I've got to get Lana to talk more. If she's lying, then she's bound to slip up and make a contradiction!)
Ms. Skye, I understand how you feel. You committed that "crime" two years ago to protect your sister.
If that truth were to be exposed now, the past two years of your life will have been useless. Even so, I am compelled to bring to everyone's attention a significant contradiction within your testimony!
You testified, and I quote, "The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan."
It's a simple oversight, really. You see, a message was written on this jar with the victim's blood.
Exactly so. And this is where the contradiction lies.
In order for the victim to be able to write his message on the jar, it must not yet have been broken before he died!
He couldn't have written Ema's name on a shattered jar!
(Something critical...?)
So the jar was already broken?
(But not as feeble as the judge's judgment...)
So you didn't know your sister's name was written on the jar?
(Well, that helps my case...)
It seems you two might make up yet.
I'm afraid this action of yours reveals what really happened.
If you really thought Darke killed Prosecutor Marshall, you wouldn't have wiped away the blood.
Leads to:
But how could you see with the power out? It should have been pitch black in that office.
Leads to:
So you illegally rearranged the crime scene?
(It's not too late. There's still plenty of time to make up... After we've gotten to the bottom of this incident!)
Leads to:
Your sister's really putting up a fight. She must really care about you. Still, she's not doing this the right way...
(I think I've finally figured out the contradictions in her testimony. There's one final "possibility" that might turn everything around!)
Ms. Skye. I believe this jar conceals a truth even you were unaware of.
We found the final piece of this jar in Chief Gant's safe.
(I knew it! She really didn't know!) There's something even more disturbing about that final piece: There was still blood on it.
Yes, which leaves us with only one explanation. On the night Prosecutor Marshall was murdered... you were not the first one to show up on the scene! Chief Gant got there before you!
I'm afraid that's unlikely. The pieces are too big for anyone to miss, let alone an ace detective!
The question is, if he did arrive there first, why did he hide that fact for two years!?
Well, Your Honor? Can you answer us that!?
Fabrication...
"Foul lies"...? (Imagine that, coming from my own client!)
...! (Wait a minute... What if... we're still smack dab in the middle of Gant's trap!?)
Lana... may be right after all.
Ms. Skye! Please testify once more!
If evidence was "fabricated" behind your back... then Ema's accidental killing of Prosecutor Marshall... might also be a lie!
Ms. Skye! If you will!
What? To me!?
But I don't remember receiving a picture like that...
(I don't remember receiving any pictures from Lana...)
I seem to remember getting something from her then...
Hey... There's a picture here!
(The cloth we found inside Chief Gant's safe!)
What's this?
(What!? But those fingerprints... They're yours, Ema!)
(This must be the "risk" the judge was talking about...)
...!
...!
... (If I show that piece of evidence now... Ema's sure to be made out as the murderer!)
(What do I do now!? I'd better think this through carefully. I can't afford to make the wrong decision! Should I present that piece of evidence? The one that shows who really killed Prosecutor Marshall?)
Yes, Your Honor. I do have further evidence.
Leads to:
(No... I can't! I can't show them that yet!)
Yes. It most likely was cut from the victim's vest, near his chest.
...!
... ... ...They're Ms. Skye's. Ms. Ema Skye's.
But this was found in your safe! That means it's possible you forged it!
!
But...!
!
No...
NNNO...NOOOOOO!!!
Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
I don't know what you're talking about.
...!
Two pieces of evidence... You mean those items in your safe!
"Insurance"...?
...
So you admit to it then, Chief Gant? That you were hiding the cloth you cut off the victim's vest in your safe?
(It's been a long battle... but the moment of truth has finally arrived! As long as I don't mess up here, victory is mine!)
(No! It's too late to show the evidence now! Besides, even if I did... it'd just expose that poor girl's fingerprints!)
The circumstances...?
...! (So... Edgeworth figured out my plan!)
Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now.
Leads to:
Judge:
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
Very well. I'll tell you. (It should be okay now. Everything's proceeding as predicted.) The person whom these fingerprints belong to are...
Leads to:
(No, it's no use lying here. They'll discover the truth the second they analyze this.)
I'm sorry, Ema...
Ms. Skye. It's not over yet...
I said this trial isn't over yet.
...
...
...
... Before I do that... there's just one little thing I have to clear up.
Who really killed Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Chief Gant, you are absolutely right. This piece of cloth proves who the real murderer is. Who killed Neil Marshall, you ask?
I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, this piece of cloth contains a critical contradiction!
I'm talking about a contradiction. One that proves... who the real killer is!
(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!) Behold! The piece of evidence that contradicts this cloth!
Leads to:
Gant:
(What am I doing!? If this cloth was cut from Prosecutor Marshall's vest after he died.. Then something's definitely not right about it!)
This is the picture Ms. Skye took. Take a good look at it. See where the piece of his vest was cut out?
Exactly my point. His chest is soaked with blood. That's only natural. His lungs no doubt were punctured. Blood poured out of his mouth.
Since Ema Skye's fingerprints are on this cloth, there's no doubt that she shoved the prosecutor aside! However! Mr. Marshall was not impaled on the sword!
Now then, Chief Gant. Let me ask you something. Prosecutor Marshall was not impaled when he was shoved aside.
If so, then tell me. Who could it have been? Who could have arrived at the scene before Ms. Skye, picked up the unconscious prosecutor, and impaled him on the armor's sword?
Remember what you admitted only moments ago? That you personally cut out this bloodless piece of the victim's vest? Ironic, isn't it? Through the very act of creating "insurance," you proved that you were the actual murderer!
(It's finished...)
!
... Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
... (It seems... at last... The time for me to reveal my plan has finally arrived.)
(No! If I admit to that... all my planning will have been for nothing!)
(He's right...)
Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point.
No it isn't, Mr. Gant.
It's not that I "didn't" present evidence then... it's that I "couldn't."
There are certain procedures involved when presenting evidence!
Leads to:
Judge:
Huh...?
I guess I should just stick to what I'm used to.
(Gant's a pro at slipping through loopholes in the law... Still, the law's the only weapon I can use to beat him!)
This is my proof, Your Honor: "Evidence Law."
I've done my homework too, Chief. Indeed, Ema Skye's fingerprints were on this piece of cloth. However! At that point in time, this was merely a piece of cloth, nothing more.
You see, it's written right here in this book: The second rule of evidence law!
I found this piece of evidence myself... inside your safe. It goes without saying I did not approval from the Police Department.
And here is the crux of the matter. You see, at the time it was impossible for me to prove the relevance... between the cloth and the SL-9 Incident.
Sorry, but can you recall... when was that picture presented?
The person who gave it value as evidence... was you, Damon Gant.
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
The only person who could have cut this from the victim's vest... is the one who stood before Prosecutor Marshall in his final moments. In other words, the real murderer! And there's only one person who that could be... Damon Gant, the killer was you!
Detective Goodman?
Detective Gumshoe's bloody hand print...
W-what does this have to do with anything? You're horrible! How could you get Ms. Skye involved in all of this!?
Well... you left the jar fragment and gloves.
There are two things I want you to understand.
First, your sister never hurt anyone. Second, Damon Gant betrayed you from the beginning. You see, Ms. Skye... you no longer have any reason to keep silent.
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye... I couldn't get you out of all your trouble.
...!
Ms. Skye...
(Liar...)
(At long last... It's finally over...) E-Ema?
Why the long face? I'm sorry your sister didn't get completely off the hook, but at least she wasn't convicted for a murder she didn't commit!
...
Ah, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
Should you be doing this? She's still under arrest, you know.
No one can change the past. The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes. Why must we make up for our mistakes, you ask? Because in so doing... we can find the way back to our path. And once we've found our path, we can move on from our past mistakes toward a brighter future. At least, that's what I felt, looking at those two sisters make up.
E-Edgeworth...?
(Where was he hiding!?)
...!
But Edgeworth...
Huh? What? Oh, uh... yeah. (What is this, a pop quiz?)
(Evidence... that neither Edgeworth nor I would have been able to find on our own?)
Ema:
Our counterattack began with this. You had one half of the evidence list, and I had the other. Apart, we wouldn't have been able to completely restore Ema's picture.
Edgeworth:
Huh?
(I guess that wasn't the right piece of evidence.)
Edgeworth! What will you do now?
Well, whatever you do, just remember. What happened in this trial can either make or break you as a prosecutor. In the end, it's up to you.
Edgeworth... I'll be waiting for you in court.
And so, another case came to a close. As for the sisters... I have faith. Faith that their lives... have only just begun. And as for me... I think it's time I started on a new journey of my own. A journey to rediscover myself.
Huh? What is it, Detective?
I thought you said it was okay.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh? Huh?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
... (Why is it... I suddenly feel like I want to scream?)

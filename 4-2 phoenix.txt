That's right. She's my daughter.
Doctor... the nurse was looking for you.
Good morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo.
Trucy. Look at the label.
I switched the labels. Don't tell Trucy, 'kay?
This "kid" I know keeps sending them to me.
...Something like that.
Ah ha ha. You got me. What can I say? I was raised in a barn. Try not to let word get out, Apollo. If you don't mind.
Gotta practice. Wouldn't want my fingers to get stiff. A pro always keeps his weapon close at hand. Shall I play you a tune?
Ah, how unfortunate. I so rarely get a chance to play.
Well, what else is there to do when you're stuck in bed? Besides, the episodes will just keep piling up if I don't keep up, you know?
Now's the only time I get to watch and write up my reports.
It's a long story. Like a lot of things, actually.
...Who could have imagined it? Me, victim of a hit and run...
Oh, he tried to swerve, I'll give him that. Picture me tossed thirty feet through the air... ...only stopping when my head hit that telephone pole.
Thankfully, my only injury was a sprained ankle.
Oh, Trucy's still a child.
Ah ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy.
Oh, something you should know about Trucy...
Not a mere stage magician... She's a genius.
You'll soon come to appreciate her "talent".
No need to get prickly, now.
So you don't think this is big trouble? My talent agency represents only two people... and one of them is in the hospital.
Yeah... That's the problem with such a tight operation. It's a symbiotic relationship. When one of us falls, the other, too, must fall...
In any case, if Apollo here can't help you... ...you'll have to transfer to a new school. Again.
On that note, how about you come work for us? I've got the perfect client for you already lined up.
Ah ha. Now it's time to reel him in!
Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh?
The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck!
You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole!
Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court!
What's that? Looks strangely familiar...
It's been seven years. I've forgotten... a lot of things.
Don't get so worked up. It was just a joke.
Your real client should be stopping by the office any time now.
...One more thing. Do look into my accident too, would you? I marked the scene of the tragedy on this map. It's right in front of this park. Should be easy to find.
I've marked the location of the accident on your map. Find the criminal who knocked me into that telephone pole!
Yo! How goes it?
Not bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R.
I was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to.
So this was the thing that led you to the car.
Good work, Apollo. Of course you might say... ...I was the one who made solving that case possible.
Thanks, Apollo. I was worried about them, too. Trucy special ordered those...
I'd hate to have to buy a new pair... *shudder*
...
Well, I certainly didn't expect you back this early.
...And? Did you find the mad driver who gave me that 30-foot toss?
Hmm... Meraktis, eh? I've heard of him. Nothing good, mind you.
All I've heard are the rumors. That clinic's been making good money... in a bad way.
Ties to organized crime... The Kentucky Family.
Some injuries you can't take to a public hospital, see. They use the Meraktis Clinic for their patch-up jobs.
Ah. A body was found there in unusual circumstances...
...It's not our concern, in any case.
...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good.
That leaves the noodle stand.
Feel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money.
Ah, you're back! Run into some problems?
What's this? So there is a problem?
A defense request! That is a problem.
I've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore.
Oh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you?
So, what about this defense request?
Did you now. That's unusual indeed. Never heard of a noodle stand being used as a murder weapon.
You mean you don't know what the murder weapon was?
A lab coat? Hmm. Didn't think she'd be involved with this...
You could say that.
I met her on a case... this was about ten years ago. She was still a high school student at the time.
...Prince?
Apollo. Tell me about this "prince" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father...
... Did he now.
My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother...
We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate.
I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon.
...Now, what was the problem again? Having trouble investigating the crime scene in the park?
...Go to the office. Under the silk top hat you'll find a bottle of white powder. Try taking that to this detective.
Just take it to her. It'll be fine, you'll see. Oh, and tell her I said hi.
Ah, the prodigal attorney returns! Welcome, Apollo. I heard you did well in the trial today. Here to discuss something? I could use a little diversion...
You certainly didn't waste any time getting to the point.
Seven years ago, I was standing in a courtroom... on behalf of a client. The case involved the death of a certain "magnificent" genius... I'd be surprised if you hadn't heard about it.
...Yes, he was only 17 years old at the time.
He took the bar exam abroad... in Europe. They're progressive over there, you know. I was defeated by a 17-year-old newcomer. In my shame, I left the practice forever. That's all.
...What do you mean?
...
...
Tell me... how does it feel? How does it feel to stand here before Phoenix Wright, the Forgin' Attorney himself?
Didn't you notice in today's trial? There was a single piece of forged evidence. I'm talking about evidence that shouldn't have existed. A naughty magician's trick...
Ah ha ha ha ha! I don't see you jumping to my defense on this one... Maybe I did forge evidence, maybe I didn't. ...It doesn't really matter now, does it?
I'm not an attorney anymore. ...That's the only truth you need to know.
Ah, so that was what led you to the guilty party.
You make a good point, Apollo. In fact... It could be said that I'm to thank for finding the criminal.
Thanks, Apollo. Though, I have to admit, as a father, I wonder... ...why are you still carrying my daughter's panties around in your pocket?
Heya. Get any sleep?
I was going out of my mind with boredom, so I signed myself out earlier today. Somehow, that place makes fake piano playing at the Indochine pasta joint seem almost fun.
Take a guess!
Ah ha ha! That Sherman tank of a mom? Nope, guess again.
It's barely morning and you're at it already, Trucy! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
...Alita Tiala. Your client's fianc√©e.
You have to wonder what Gavin's up to.

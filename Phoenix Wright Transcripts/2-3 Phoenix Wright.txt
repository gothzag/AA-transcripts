Huh? What is it Pearls?
(I don't think it has anything to do with channeling...) You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?
(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus... It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... It was during that terrible time that I met Pearls...)
(It seems like she is starting to get back to normal...)
Pearls! You remembered the train!
Don't worry about it. Really.
("Happy New Year"... I really hope it will turn out that way...)
(Well... Today wraps it up for this year... I hope I can finish cleaning this place up in one day.)
...Hello. This is the Wright & Co. Law Offices.
Ahh, Maya. Perfect timing... Things are terrible here too!
The office is a terrible mess! And I have to clean it up!
Ummm... My dirty office. What are you talking about?
(The TV?)
(Huh? What happened...?)
The Very... I mean... The Berry Big Circus...
They're saying that there was a... murder.
A-Arrested who?
(Maximillion Galactica. Fans call him Max. A popular magician who can fly through the sky at will... Maya said she was a huge fan of Max...)
Huh? What?
W-WWWHHHAATTT!?
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I wouldn't mind dumping some of these off at the used bookstore... But that might not be such a good idea.
Charley. A quite decorative plant. I wouldn't mind his help cleaning this place up.
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
A poster of the newest member of the "Steel Samurai" universe. Maya went out and bought it right away. She's a sucker for all things Steel Samurai. I hear they're even giving the new guy his own movie. I just know Maya is going to drag me out to see it with her...
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.
You're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight* of hand...
(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)
(Eek... I don't want to steal one of his hearts...)
Her driver?
Umm... I want this one.
Hey... Umm... What about my card?
...
...
I was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.
(Absolutely cringe inducing.)
Smile, you're on candid camera. Max keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.
(What is this guy talking about!?) Anyways... Lately, you've become awfully famous, haven't you Max?
(Jeez, people nowadays... They get their panties all in a bunch over nothing!) Anyway, Maximillion, you won a very prestigious award recently, did you not?
(I'm going to guess he didn't win a trophy for most modest magician.)
That's why you signed the contract?
(Maya looks a bit down...)
Tell me what happened at the Berry Big Circus.
Questioned you about what?
(She's right... I think I should shock him back to reality...)
Before the murder, you met with the Ringmaster?
What did you talk about?
Maya. Would you please ask him?
That's all you talked about?
(Fabulous! Why does he have to keep saying fabulous!?)
(I wonder how people can lie with such a straight face...)
I'm not a magician, Max. I'm an attorney.
(Wait a second... He's planting her in the audience to rig a magic trick!)
Do you mind taking a look at this?
(He signed his own photo...)
What about this?
(*sigh*)
Why is that?
So?
And that means?
Which means what?
They don't arrest people as a joke.
Well he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)
Yes?
Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.
OK... OK... I'll take your case.
Really.
What's the matter, Maya?
...
Yes?
(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)
(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)
(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)
(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)
Alright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.
? What's the matter? You seem down.
So now what do we do?
Yeah. I guess you're right.
I could have sworn I've heard that before.
Just admit it, you don't have a clue what happened.
It may be showing a bit of wear, but I try to take good care of this thing.
(She's right... I whip it out at the drop of a hat.)
Hmm... Do you really believe that?
Your autobiography...?
What's the matter? You've been acting strange for a while now.
So? Why does that matter? He's still a famous magician right?
(Yikes! The poor guy's got three first names! I guess that is pretty odd.)
"A big star..."?
N-N-Na... *cough* Umm... What's the "A" stand for?
I'll think about it...
This is kinda pointless don't you think?
(When she's right... She's right.)
Yep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)
Sounds like a plan.
Yep. One look at the huge tent looming over you and you realize "This is the circus!"
Even when you don't want to see him... *poof* He's right in front of you. (Sure the sign says "Berry Big Circus"... But looking around... It might as well be Cirque du Galactica...)
Nah! Nah! It's alright!
Those streamers do a nice job introducing the circus performers.
You know... You don't really see too many streamers nowadays, do you?
(Umm... I don't think that was why...)
It's a snack stand. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks... Not to mention...
(Who would eat snow cones in the middle of winter?)
Look around... There's tons of snow piled up all around here!
(Hopefully she doesn't notice that discolored snow in the corner. That's not syrup!)
Maya. The circus is closed today. No clowns. No elephants. No shows.
There's no Dali. Not today.
(*sigh* It's not like we're here on business or anything...)
This is the Box Office where they sell all the tickets for the circus.
So then why don't you buy one now?
If you want me to buy it for you, just ask me already.
"No Entry To Unauthorized Personnel"
(I'm not even going to justify that question with a response...)
This seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...
Heh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?
There's some evidence under the tarp over there...
And what do you mean you "won" an air conditioner? You didn't buy it?
(So he's saying the murder took place in the light...?)
This is the only place that the snow has been trounced upon.
(It's great to know that the police aren't worried about preserving the evidence...)
Do you know who will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow?
Uhhh... She isn't gonna hit me with her whip again, is she?
Exactly what he said. He's not around. Edgeworth is gone... Don't say his name again, OK?
The Ringmaster of the circus was murdered, wasn't he?
Excuse me, but do you mind telling me what happened to the victim?
But?
What was this one thing that just didn't quite fit? The thing you mentioned earlier.
What's this? This wooden box under the body?
The victim's footprints are on the scene.
A flying... Criminal? (That's when something just clicked in my head...)
That's right. Flying is impossible! Absolutely impossible! Haha...
I meant nothing by it, pal...
(Better stated, it means I don't want to talk about it. Maybe I can get some info about Max out of him...)
Umm... How about any eyewitnesses...?
Hmm... Oh well...
What?
Let's check it out!
I'll only wear it if Detective Gumshoe carries a Steel Samurai Police Badge.
Really?
(Hmm, he's a bit arrogant, but he didn't seem that bad.)
... Pretty mundane, aren't they?
(I must have hit a nerve...)
Who said?
T-Tell us about the eyewitness!!
(Glad I stayed out of that one...)
Oh... Is that right?
Cracks? Wait... You don't mean cracks of the...
Uhhh...
This is it?
I guess he's not here...
(My room's probably worse though...)
All those clown costumes lined up like that... I dunno about you, but it's creepy.
It must be a collection of clown costumes from around the world.
What is it now? (She better not want me to try one of those on!)
In OUR office!? As soon as you start paying the bills, you can say that.
Look at the ceiling... It looks like someone punched a hole in it!
(Hmm... I don't even want to imagine what goes on in here.)
How strange. The carrots seem to come in all different shapes... Weird... I can't tell if Moe just likes carrots, or if he is using them for some sort of gag.
(You can even tell that the ground has been disturbed...)
(I guess it wouldn't have been strange for someone to have seen the crime from here.)
Moe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.
Moe seems to be a voracious reader. Look at all the hard books he has here. "Clowns for Dummies", "The Joke's On You", "Treat Your Peons Right", And the classic "Funny Jokes Are Funny."
"The Joke's On You"... Huh?
He's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.
(Who knows with that guy. Maybe that's part of the gag?)
Forget the shoes! Check out the great gag banana peel!
(Are you blind? Look at how many scratches there are from people slipping on it!!)
The circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...
I'm not doing any somersaults.
(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)
It wasn't me.
H-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!
(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)
...
Huh!?
... I guess...
(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)
Phoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)
Uhh... Likewise...
They are, but it also means that lots of people can fit in the big top.
It's just a stepladder.
Oh... Uh... OK. (It's not even worth arguing with her on this one.)
I've got to admit, that was a pretty cool effect!
That's great Regina!
(Sometimes I wonder about this girl...)
There doesn't seem to be anything here that can help us... Not a single clue.
... A bloody chainsaw for instance...
Probably for tightrope walking...
(Ouch... Thanks a lot Maya!)
Uh huh.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you... (Urk! That was insensitive!)
Even your dad?
(Regent... So she was with that beast...)
(For someone who's* father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky... I wish she would tell us more about her dad...)
Léon?
(Léon the lion... Regent and Regina... Interesting name choices...)
What!?
(It's tough not to get charmed when she looks at you with those innocent eyes...)
Ah!
...
Don't worry about me...
P-P-P-Professed their love!?
(I wonder how many people have stolen one of his hearts anyways...?)
What? Who was it!?
Trilo...?
(Hmm... Haven't met him yet.)
She must have some sort of strange power over them!
(Me too! She's so cute...)
That's right.
(I think she's just being nice.)
Y-You don't know?
He's been arrested. He was charged with the murder of your father.
Of course he's not!
(Two women with whips... That's my cue to shut up and act like a good boy...)
No objections here!
Hmm...
(The Ringmaster's room... It's probably a good idea to check it out for myself.)
What about this? What can you tell me?
(I never expected Maya to make a new friend in a strange place like this...)
What do you think about this person?
Sorry?
Huh? I just wanted to know if you knew this person.
They found it at the murder scene.
(Max must be really confused...)
(Hmm...)
(Actually, she was laughing and rolling around with her tiger...)
What about this person?
(That's awfully harsh...)
He must be in questioning.
He should be back in a little bit.
Smile, you're on candid camera.
This guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he is bored? He doesn't even try to glance over this way...
It does have a feather on it. Maybe that's why you think it can take off.
Yeah... I guess so...
No matter what the crime, we always meet the same detective at the scene.
(Something tells me that no matter how you look at it, he's anything but elite...)
Yeah, but that's the problem... She is so mean. And that whip... That thing hurts. It really hurts.
W-Why me!? W-What did I do!?
I have to admit that her smile does have a sort of hypnotic power.
Once this case is solved, I'll roll over for you as many times as you want!
So I'm told. Why would anyone want to kill such a beloved man of the big top?
(You can count on that...)
Yes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.
I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting* poster.
I wanna get outta here...
It's like a guided tour of the circus' history.
What about the clients who were found guilty?
They almost look like... Thank You cards. It looks like every year the Ringmaster made donations to charity... To the Robot Clown Research Center...
What!? They may be a perfectly reputable charity in the field of advanced tomfoolery!
Indeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...
There are indeed.
Maya... We're supposed to be the honest ones around here.
(Arghhh... She already swiped one!)
You're incorrigible, you know that?
Look at all the stars on this poster... This must have been the poster they used to promote their public appearances.
What do you mean?
With those taglines, our law firm would sink faster than the Titanic...
And they call this "the face of someone who already knew that..." Hmm...
A scrap of white paper is sticking out of the coat pocket.
Calm down, Maya. You can't just go rummaging through people's coats!
It's quite a collection of the most understated colors. Shocking Pink for example.
And this one says "Sensitive enough for a baby, strong enough for a mime."
There's a really big photo on the desk... It's a picture of Regina and her father, the Ringmaster.
It's a table for guests... There are some papers scattered on top.
W-What is it?
(She looks like she's about ready to pass out from shock...) How much is it!? How much is it!? T-T-THAT MUCH!?
You can say that again. (This must be the paper they used to negotiate Max's salary... The Ringmaster signed and dated it...)
Max definitely got a raise... But this document is dated a week ago!
This was the table he used when visitors came to see him.
Someone with terrible manners must have put their shoes up on the table!
I wasn't! How uncouth do you think I am anyway?
What?
Hello.
Yes. You work at the circus don't you?
(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.
I don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?
I believe they call it a stage name.
Excuse me, Ben?
About the murder. I'd like to talk to you about the details, if I may.
(This guy's so nervous, he's creeping me out.)
(Did he just say that Max is "Not Very Nice"?)
(Yikes. I hope he is OK. It sounds like he just popped a gasket...)
You already told us that you were a ventriloquist!!
I can't help it! He's making me nervous!!
A-A-A-A-Ah... I-I-I-I-I W-W-W-W-Why... (Urk!! He's contagious!!)
(Wait... We're the ones asking the questions around here...)
What's the matter, Maya?
I'm not a big fan of either one of them.
(No stranger than a poster of a hunk of junk carrying around a spear!)
Like what?
So it's money you're after?
I bet it's fun once you get good at it.
You might want to practice not moving your lips so much.
(Don't you have another type of training to attend to, young lady...?)
(Earplugs... Must... Find... Earplugs...)
...
Umm...
Umm... Maya?
(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)
In my book, they're just funny lookin'.
*sigh* I'm goin' home...
You know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!
(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)
(Snazzy dresser!? More like spazzy dresser if you ask me!)
(I didn't understand any of that, nor do I ever want to.)
Moe, you've got quite the collection of pajamas... They really scream out to you.
(Wait a second... He sleeps in clown costumes!?)
The classic "Pull My Finger" or "Clown Car Maintenance and Repair".. Not to mention the bestseller "Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Pierrots"...
Maybe he is just trying to cover all of his bases?
(Too bad he didn't buy "How To Be A Funny Clown"...)
It looks like you've put quite a bit of wear and tear on that equipment...
(And the hits just keep on comin'... *sigh*)
Har! Har! Har! Har! Har! Har!
Moe...
Ugh...
Let's talk about the murder.
(So this is what Detective Gumshoe was talking about... Moe was the eyewitness to the crime!)
Hmm...
"A bit long in the tooth?"
On him...?
Go ahead.
(I bet he's still hiding something about Max...)
You say you saw the crime. Do you mind telling me what you saw?
Stiff lips? Wait... Do you mean me?
*achem* *achem*
Just getting ready. OK... Do you know why I, Phoenix Wright, am a great lawyer? Because I'm Wright all the time!!
(Geesh, cut a guy some slack. At least it was funnier than Chuckles over here.)
(He knows more about Max than he is letting on...)
That's what I've been told...
It seems that the Ringmaster was truly a great man...
Ben? (The ventriloquist with the speech impediment?)
(It's true what they say about the tears of a clown...)
He's a ventriloquist isn't he?
Ben wouldn't tell me a single thing about the murder.
(Hmm... Master and puppet...)
You went so far past it, you'll need a map to get back!
What do you think about this? Anything come to mind?
Umm... I think that's enough advice for now...
(Now he's just laughing to hear his own voice...)
Yep. It definitely made me look at things in a new light.
(Well... I can't argue that some people might find it funny... But the only thing it tickles on me is my desire for high quality earplugs...)
Umm... No comment...
This must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.
He said that yesterday morning Max "clonked" Ben over the head here.
Don't ask...
The kitchen is over here. Everyone must have taken turns cooking. There's a duty list posted here.
Doesn't seem like anyone ever read this sign, huh?
Well, that would definitely make them clean up!
Ah, a bulletin board... For... Umm... Bulletins. It doesn't look like there are any useful clues posted here.
Juicy?
Give it up Maya... You know Gumshoe would take it all seriously.
This is strange... There's nothing on top of this stand.
Isn't a bit small to be a VIP table? You won't be putting a ten course meal on this.
There are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic last night to clean up.
W-Why do we have to clean up...!?
B-But... This is a crime scene! We can't clean it up! We have to preserve it for evidence!!
(Not as much as I hate cleaning dirty cafeterias!)
It looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder.
Once we're finished with the case.
(Where's the mute button when you need it?)
The chair's been knocked over.
It almost looks as if someone knocked it over in a struggle, or used it for self defense...
(What's this? ...Must be a juice bottle or something?)
Hmm... A broken bottle just lying in the middle of the floor.
... "There's Gotti be something interesting there."
Looks like we're going to have to go back and meet with him.
(...*sigh* Did he just call me his sweetie!? AGAIN!?)
Well, we've gathered quite a few clues...
That's why we came to meet with you again.
OK then Max... Let's make this "absolutely fabulous"!!
People who really understand?
(Hmm, so Regina understands him huh?)
(That's strange. Regina never said anything about marrying this joker...)
You met with the Ringmaster on the night of the murder?
And then?
Did he go to the plaza where the body was discovered?
Can I ask what you do with such an exorbitant salary?
(That makes sense now. Wait a minute... That doesn't make any sense!)
(Well, he's definitely not describing Franziska!)
He must have really been a nice guy.
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Last night, you met with the Ringmaster, correct? To negotiate your salary, and such?
That's the truth? The whole truth?
You just went to his office to negotiate your new salary?
Leads to:
Max:
What's the matter?
Huh?
(It seems this evidence isn't enough to make him confess...)
It was on the table in the Ringmaster's room. You weren't lying when you said that you received quite a raise...
Not with the compensation... Just with the date. This is dated a week ago.
Max! You finished your contract negotiations a week ago!
He called you? Why did he do that?
(The Ringmaster called him... I wonder if there was some sort of problem?) Um... Max? Perhaps you could share with me what you two spoke about?
Isn't this why the Ringmaster called you into his room that night?
Isn't this why you were called to the Ringmaster's room that night?
The cafeteria... But you already knew that didn't you?
(He's still hiding something else.) Max.
It didn't fall and break on the floor. You used this bottle to...
Max:
You nailed him over the head with this bottle, didn't you?
And that's why you got called to the Ringmaster's room that night.
Max:
...Huh?
(What did I do? Hmm... I must be on the wrong track...)
(He won't tell me the truth!) ... Max.
Max:
You had a run-in with Ben?
Ah-ha! So you're admitting that you did have a fight with someone!?
This proves it.
Isn't it obvious that I found it in the cafeteria, Max? You busted Ben over the head with this bottle, did you not?
That's how the bottle broke. And that's why you were called to the Ringmaster's room.
Max:
Well... It fits in with the chain of events.
Max:
How 'bout it Max?
No no no no no... PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT DISAPPEAR!! (Hmm... I gotta try again! The Ringmaster called him... I wonder if there was some sort of problem?) Um... Max? Perhaps you could share with me what you two spoke about?
You mean you had a fight with Ben the ventriloquist?
"Told her he was in love with her"!! Are you sure this is the Ben we are talking about!?
Your chance?
Hmm... I see...
(...Shut him up?)
But... A puppet doesn't talk.
(Then don't go hiding puppets!)
Yeah... I wanted to ask him something.
Don't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.
Of course.
I'm not seeing how that's related...
But they make up for it with the amount of people that can see a show.
I'm glad I don't pay you to come up with this stuff...
It's "grand" alright.
(How'd I know that she'd say that...)
It can be snuffed out in an instant by falling gargantuan lights.
Apparently you didn't notice the big sign that said "closed" by the snack stand.
Will you just stop it you poster pilferer!
You mean stole one of those posters!
(Trilo... Ohh! The ventriloquist's puppet!)
Indeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...
Hmm... There's something shoved under the bookshelf! This... is...
I think you're right. We'll give it back to him later.
Whatever. Let's hurry up and give this thing back to Ben.
(I don't see how talking about the weather is helping our case.)
Tell us what you know about the murder...
You've been in the circus for a long time, haven't you Ben?
(Hmm... That's odd... Max said something about a confession of love...)
Alright Maya... Let's get going!
Let's see... Maybe we should go talk to the clown once again.
You... You're... Trilo!?
(Not again... *sigh*) Mr. Quist... Is that better?
Tell us what you know about the murder...
Madonna?
You mean Max Galactica? Why do you say that?
You were there...?
(But she did seem a bit worried about things...)
(...But what...?)
But those lyrics... I think they need a little work.
"Now that Trilo's here..." Does that mean you can talk normally now?
Uhh...
Ahh... Hey! Wait a second!
He's a witness for tomorrow's trial...
Quite a pair, those two. What did that puppet see anyways
Oh no... Now what!?
Ahhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ahhhhhhhhhh...
T-T-That monkey... ... AHHHH! My badge!! That monkey stole it!!
You!! That monkey!!
B-B-But!! My attorney's badge!!
OK... If you say so... (If I don't get my badge back, how can I flash it?)
The monkey... Is called Money?
Well, the rich ape just stole my attorney's badge. Mind if I get that back?
Eh?
Well, I guess I'll just have to find out where Money disappeared to...
(Go to Moe's... Hmm... I guess it is time that I revisit that kooky clown...)
Trilo told you he was in love with you?
(Like sand through the hourglass, so are the Days of the Circus...)
Yeah... Max and Trilo both said otherwise. They said they asked for her hand in marriage.
I forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly.
Wait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?
Oh boy.
Take a look at this...
Ouch... Yeah, that would be a bit insensitive of me.
Eh?
...
Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya? I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.
Something's covered up by this tarp... An old sign perhaps.
...
(Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!)
This is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while.
Hold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it.
That's what they say. (There were performers in the lodging house, so it makes sense that it was on. I bet the killer was worried that someone would spot them during the crime...)
The Ringmaster's body was found here. I heard that the way he fell over made him look like he was carrying a wooden box... But what in the world really happened here?
*ugh*
... *sigh*
So, about Regina...
(I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...)
Have you ever heard of a monkey named Money?
He stole my Attorney's Badge!
Eh? Why's that?
(Hmm, should we go with him now, or wait a while?)
We'll go after we talk some more, OK?
Don't "Woohoo!!" that!!
*huff* *huff*
I... can't... breathe...
*pant* *pant*
Acro?
Just as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...
I know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)
You can see the Big Top from the window here.
The inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts.
Money must use this to swing around on...
Maybe later...
Umm... The net looks fine to me. You really think that he plays basketball?
... You're joking right? You think the monkey has got proverbial "game"?
(Well, a prehensile tail might be an unfair advantage...)
Whoever's in this room must really love monkeys.
It's been one wild year. Especially the last part...
This bed is incredibly well made. It's almost like a maid made it up. Even the laundry on top of the bed is folded perfectly.
Can't a man respect another man for doing something said man cannot do?
Hmm... He's got a barbell. Look around... Everything he's got is for upper body training. Wait a second... These are the same machines I see on TV all the time!
What?
Don't overdo it Maya. You don't want to end up a muscle woman.
Look at this! It's a trophy! And it's really heavy!!
Thanks! You really saved me! ... Huh?
Yeah. Check this out.
There's something engraved on it... "From T to R"...
Well... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...
Who knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)
That's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...
No clues here.
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
Good morning Max.
That's understandable.
W-What!?
Huh?
No no no no no... We can't be having you flying around the courtroom... It just wouldn't be right. Imagine if you hit someone!
What is it this time, Max?
...
(I like the sound of that... "Dashing young lawyer flying fabulously...")
...
So...
Yes, Your Honor, he does often go by that name.
(Hmm... I wonder if that is to our advantage?)
Eh?
(She must still be upset about what happened last time...)
M-M-M-Me!? ... Guilty!? What are you talking about!?
Yes, Your Honor.
Let me ask you about the snow...
Did it pile up?
(Hmm... The snow... Let me see... There's got to be more to this...)
I need to take a look at the Court Record...
When you say "all of the circus performers"... Who do you mean?
Out of curiosity, what about the circus monkey?
After the practice was over, where did everyone head off to...?
(Actually, Max was asking for Regina's hand in marriage!)
I'd like you to be a bit more specific about the events at 10:15 PM.
A "wooden box"?
(This may be my only chance, so I might as well ask some questions...)
This wooden box... You figure it weighs about 20 pounds, right?
Iron plating? Why do you think it's lined with iron?
You said the box was locked. How exactly was it locked?
So, when you found the box, it was locked, correct?
Do you mind telling us what was inside that box?
What's inside the bottle?
(There was only one little bottle in that huge box...?)
According to the Autopsy Report, the murder weapon was a blunt object, correct?
And you haven't found this murder weapon, have you?
He gave us the facts, as he saw them. But there's gotta be more to this.
(I guess that's all we're gonna get out of Gumshoe in this case...)
(She must be talking about Ben the ventriloquist...)
It's just the lyrics... They leave something to be desired, so to speak.
(Hmm... He's got a point.)
Ah...
O-OK... (I guess she's the boss again today...)
The clown... You're talking about Moe?
Poor guy...
What did you do then?
It was awfully cold out that night... Especially with all the snow around... Wouldn't thinking in your nice warm lodging house have been a better idea?
(But I'm a good thinker! At least my teachers always said I was...)
Are you sure it was really Max Galactica?
Snobby 3 piece get-up?
You saw max and only Max, right Trilo?
(There's more to this story than meets the eye... Is there something amiss in this?)
(I can't really see anything wrong with what Ben... I mean Trilo said.)
Wait a second! There's no proof that the witness saw Maximillion Galactica...
(Great, I'm getting shut down by a toy!)
That's a bit strange, don't you think?
That you only saw Max... Doesn't it seem like you should have seen someone else as well?
Leads to:
Trilo:
(I've gotta find a way to get more information out of this witness...)
That's correct. If Trilo was at the entrance to the plaza... He should have seen the Ringmaster as well! Ah-hah!
What are you talking about!? The Ringmaster and Max went together to the Ringmaster's room!
Ahh!!
He's right...
You saw Max and only Max that night?
(He really needs to improve his manners...)
Around what time did the police arrive at the scene?
Practice ended at 10 PM so you hung around the lodging house the entire time?
Wasn't it awfully cold? I can't believe you'd just stand outside in that weather!
Well, maybe you were waiting for someone?
But! This witness! He's cracking under the pressure already! I'm on to something!
Leads to:
Trilo:
(I've gotta find a way to get more information out of this witness...)
Well, if he was waiting outside in the cold, it was for one person... And one person only! He was waiting for the animal tamer, Regina!
You were waiting outside for Regina to come back to the lodging house. Am I mistaken?
Eh...
He's right...
Well, Max is part of that bitter love triangle with Regina. Which is probably why Max conked him over the head.
Uh... Yeah... I think so... I dunno anymore!
Alright! There is obviously a reason why this witness was there that night! He spent all that time waiting for Regina to arrive! Moreover... Even if someone else would've walked right in front of him, I doubt he would have paid them a second thought!
However, he did not see the victim on the way to his eventual demise! If you accept that, then you must accept that there is a high likelihood that... He could have missed someone else other than Max heading to the scene! OWWW!!
(His Honor is looking a little less than honorable right now...)
By proposal, you mean proposing marriage, correct? To Regina.
That was it exactly that you planned on giving her?
(Wow... Those two nearly fell out of their chairs!)
(Franziska's whip looks like it's about to lash out at almost anything... One hit from that thing will probably shut someone up for a long time...)
(I think I'm gonna live to fight another day and shut up now...)
It may be something of a joke, but this is a historic moment! The first time that a puppet has ever proposed to a human being... OWWW!!
An engagement ring...?
(It's just a ring...)
Well... There's got to be something I can catch him on...
Who's pocket was the ring in?
(Really?)
Leads to:
So you went to the lodging house to give it to her?
Well... They always say that love creates rivalries.
Leads to:
So you are still thinking of trying to give it to Regina...?
Probably way more than he deserves.
Leads to:
I think it's time to unwrap this toy's testimony.
(Uh oh, the judge has that dazed look again. Maybe he should get out more.)
Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?
(Uh oh... Looks like they're going to double team me now...) Do you recognize this ring?
Didn't you just testify about this very object? I believe you said... "In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've got it in my pocket!" Why then, do I have it right here...?
I found this in Money's room...
Well, Your Honor... Money really is a monkey... In every sense of the word.
Money likes to go after the shiniest things that he can find and gather them up.
Trilo! When was this ring stolen from you?
Details... I need more details...
Right about when you saw the defendant walk past, correct?
It's not for you to decide what has to do with what! Now Trilo! Back to the topic at hand!
What did you do when the ring was taken Trilo?
But you weren't able to catch up with him were you?
Well... This does indeed prove one very important point.
Obviously that one Mr. Benjamin Woodman is lacking in the area of exercise!!
This is clear from the testimony we have just listened to!! He was too slow and awkward to catch a monkey fleeing through the snow!!! (This revelation doesn't seem to be registering too well around the courtroom...)
Umm... OK.
There is a huge contradiction in this witness' testimony!
The witness just testified to the following effect-- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza!
I'm saying that there is no possible way that this witness saw the plaza the entire time! That's where I'm going with this little theory! Which leads me to my next point. It is entirely possible that someone other than the defendant was at the scene!
Well, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene!
The witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max!
(You've already changed your story stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.)
Exactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him!
Then Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him?
So you were only concerned with waiting for Regina that night? That means you probably wouldn't have noticed if someone else showed up.
(Yikes! The judge is even more dangerous to our case than Trilo!)
So you saw Max coming out of the Big Top that night?
(I guess that makes sense, especially since he was waiting for Regina.)
About what time would you say these events took place?
Hmm... What time was it? Lemme think about that for a second......... ...YEOW!! I'm no good at math!
So you testified that you said "good evening" to Max that night.
(There's got to be something wrong with this bit of testimony...)
(I guess it's kinda petty to bad mouth someone's performances...)
Glad to see you finally coming around to that.
Isn't that a bit strange to you?
Well, if you hate Max so much, why would you bother being nice to him? It strikes me as somewhat strange.
Well... If it was simply just being cordial to a coworker I would understand... OWW!! That hurt!!
(There's no reason that Trilo would ever say something nice to Max... But how do I go about proving that with the evidence?)
I guess I can give it a shot...
I hate to say it, but Ben's part of your little act is coming off a bit stale! I'm sure that if a pro was to review your work, he would say... OWWW!!
OW! OWWW! AWWWWWW! THAT HURTS!!
Leads to:
You are 100% absolutely sure of what you just said?
Those three ridiculous symbols, huh?
Maya... You didn't have to join in did you!?
I agree. But do we have the proof to make something stick?
All right, time to go to work.
Trilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?
A fight over Regina to be exact.
A disagreement usually doesn't end with someone getting clonked over the head...
That morning, Ben got clobbered over the head by Max, didn't he?
The truth is that on the day of the crime, the defendant and witness had a huge fight! There is absolutely no way they would have suddenly become cordial that evening! Moreover, just consider the personality of the witness on stand! There is no way a puppet this lewd would just up and say "good evening" to his rival!
Yes, Your Honor.
Of course, the witness did not see a soul that night.
*gulp*
Wh-What do you mean?
But... Trilo and Max... They were in the middle of a huge fight.
Of course he saw the defendant! How could he miss Maximillion Galactica!? OWWWW!!
Ahh...
(Foiled again...)
Yeah, I know... (And by the looks of things I've gotta hurry up!)
It is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night... It was just someone else! That's who he said "good evening" to.
The correct one. Furthermore, I don't believe the person the witness saw was Max at all.
If he had truly met Max that night, there would have been no greeting at all. Which means there is only one proper answer. The person the witness saw that night was not Maximillion Galactica. That is why Trilo made the effort to greet whoever it was that he saw that evening. Or "good evening" as he put it.
Leads to:
This is the person that this witness felt the need to greet that night!
(Uh oh, now I've done it!)
Considering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!
No, Your Honor, it is not Regina. If it was Regina, Trilo would have given her the engagement ring as a present.
You are correct. It was indeed Russell Berry.
The person you saw that evening was the victim, the Ringmaster, Russell Berry. That's why you greeted him Trilo. Isn't that correct?
Answer the question, Mr. Quist!
Three symbols?
A silk hat and a cloak! Anyone could wear them! They'd even look good on me!
Well, the witness has endlessly repeated that he saw Max's three symbols... However, how do we really know it was Maximillion Galactica? It could have been someone else, dressed up as him. Possibly even Russell Berry!
(Yes! I think we've finally won a point in this one!!)
Huh?
What do you mean by that?
HUH!?
And while you were there, it was the Ringmaster who left the room, right?
That's what it seems like.
It means that the Ringmaster could have taken his costume, and went out looking like Max!
Hmm...
Double hmm...
(Fabulous... This mystery just keeps getting deeper...)
(Why did she just call him a "pitiful" clown?)
Umm... Aren't we the ones supposed to be asking the questions here?
(Poor Gumshoe...)
Yes, Your Honor.
I know that!
Your Honor?
I understand Your Honor.
(Why am I responsible!? I'm not the one with the corny jokes.)
You'd say that practice wrapped up around 10 PM correct?
Huh?
Let's not make it 8:00 PM, alright Moe?
There are three reasons why I don't want to... One, I probably won't laugh. Two, I'll get hit with a penalty. Three, I'll get whipped. Will the witness just proceed with his factual testimony...
... OWWW!!
(This isn't funny at all... In more ways that* one...)
You were "pooped" that night?
What?
That joke was so hip, I don't want to ruin it with a reply.
You just happened to glance out of the window?
(What should I do? I wonder if I should press him further on this issue...)
Very well, Moe. How about we get back to your testimony now?
(Of course! You threatened me with a penalty if I don't keep this stooge in check!)
Exactly why did you look out of your window that night?
That's not what I meant. I meant that... Well... When we spoke yesterday...
Your Honor, the witness looked out of his window upon hearing a loud sound. He did not just simply "glance" out of his window that night.
Umm... Yeah... What she said... I believe it would be best if Moe were to revise his testimony.
(This should start turning the tables in our favor!)
What was the sound like?
Far away you say... If you had to say exactly, how far away were they?
You'd say you clearly saw this? Even though you were, by your own admission, far away?
Uppity symbols?
You say you saw the Ringmaster get "clonked" over the head!?
(He does enjoy the completely random non sequitur...) What would you say the victim was struck with?
No no no... You did say you saw the entire thing, didn't you?
Moe! Did you or did you not see the crime of murder committed that night!?
*gulp* (Wasn't that a bit melodramatic...)
Well... See... Right now, I don't have a clear basis to be thinking that...
That's right! What he said! (Bailed out by the judge! What an honor indeed!)
Huh?
(I guess he didn't really bail me out after all...)
Of course I have grounds to make this claim!
That's something I can't share with you at this time.
(I know there's something wrong with this testimony... But I can't put why I feel this way into words for the Judge...)
Yeah, you're right...
(Yikes. That's harsh...)
Yeah I noticed. We've just got to pinpoint what's changed.
I've got a great reason to make my claim!
Of course I will... The reason is... The witness' very own testimony!
Moe said that he heard a sound like a "thump" of someone getting hit.
However, Moe just stated the following under oath.
If Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon hearing a sound, there is no way that he could have seen Max "clonk" anyone!
These types of witnesses always seem to have a selective memory... You just have to peel back the layers of the clown make-up to find the truth.
"Pretty much"...?
(Von... Von Karma!! Tampering with witnesses again!!)
He said he wasn't there. We have to keep believing that.
Don't you think that you are going a little overboard with how explicit you're being? 'That shadow belonged to Max' is an awfully firm statement, don't you think?
I'm just saying that one of your fellow performer's life is on the line here. Are you truly, 100% absolutely certain that it was Max?
(It doesn't seem like he is jumping to any conclusions this time...) Let's go over this again then. What makes you so sure that you saw Max that night?
Trilo said the same thing. But if it was just the symbols, then even I could have been wearing them. What if someone had just taken Max's symbols and worn them?
Leads to:
You're sure that is what you saw that night?
(Umm... Don't birds have terrible night vision?)
Leads to:
You were able to see that kind of detail from your window?
Out of curiosity Moe, what is your eyesight like?
(That must mean he could have seen the crime scene clearly.)
So, you didn't actually see what the criminal was holding?
(Too bad they haven't found the murder weapon to know for sure...)
(With Trilo's testimony, and now Moe's... It really seems like Max is the killer.)
That's not going to be enough...
I have to prove that Moe saw someone other than Max that night! That's the only thing that will help! I've gotta do it!
You say you saw all of Max's "uppity" symbols?
Moe... Everyone knows that Maximillion Galactica has three uppity symbols!
Moe! You didn't see the roses, did you!?
But the witness said he was able to see the silhouette of the criminal's face. Not to mention that the roses are white! There's no way he could have missed them!
If that was the case, then the police would have found them near the crime scene!
... (I got her on the ropes now... Whenever there's a nugget of truth, it always seems to peek out at me... Then run away.) Someone is toying with the court, but it's not me! Your Honor! Do you recall Trilo's testimony?
Trilo saw them all! Trilo saw all three of Max's symbols! However, this witness claims there were no white roses on the person he saw! There is absolutely no doubt that this is a contradiction!
Your Honor! It may be trivial, but there should still be doubt lingering in your mind!
(A ruling...!!)
Just one chance?
(I've only got a single shot as* this... I've got to be careful.) I understand, Your Honor. One chance is all I will need!
Moe... Be honest... OWWW!!
Ungh... I'm finished...
Moe... Be honest... OWWW!!
Ungh... I'm finished...
Moe... Be honest... OWWW!!
Ungh... I'm finished...
Moe... Be honest... OWWW!!
Ungh... I'm finished...
Leads to:
There's no way I'm going to lose after coming this far. There's gotta be an answer. And it's probably in the Court Record!
This wouldn't happen to be the silk hat you saw that night, would it?
No question in your mind?
I see...
Ms. von Karma. Where exactly was the silk hat found?
The silk hat fell off at the crime scene! However the witness clearly testified to the contrary!! The witness stated that "He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!"
It's pitiful, isn't it?
(He... Left the scene?)
There's something I've been mulling over for a while now. Moe?
You just said that he left the scene... Exactly how did the murderer leave the scene of the crime?
This witness' testimony is so full of holes, Ms. von Karma's protest is useless!
That's what I expected you'd say... You sure that's how it happened?
Leads to:
How about this!?
(What happened? It's like I turned into Moe or something...)
Look at this picture. The problem is the footprints in the snow...
In this photo, we can clearly see the footprints of the victim! However, where are the criminal's footprints? They aren't there!!
So Moe, exactly how did the criminal escape the scene?
Your Honor! This witness has already proven that his testimony is completely unreliable! I move to strike all of this witness' testimony from the court record!
...
It's obvious that the witness' eyes are playing tricks on him...
(Jeez... I didn't say you were lying!)
What he just said was so strange, I don't think he would have made it up.
That's what I think...
Yikes! You're right! OWWW!!
Right now, I can't believe any of this! I'm not even sure if this day hasn't been some kind of Kafkaesque dream... OWWW!!
Umm, uhh...
That's what I want to know!
Max, I can't believe I'm asking this, but you didn't fly that night, did you?
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry you had to break a magician's creed to keep the magic tricks secret...
All we can do now is hope we find the flying criminal in court tomorrow.
What is it?
Magic tricks?
That's because the tricks are performed by pros. They do it so you can't guess the trick.
Pearls did a magic trick? Hmm... What kind of trick was it?
Heh...
Really? Was it kinda like this...?
You'll take all the fun out of magic if you keep trying to figure it out.
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
What!? You're reading!? THESE!? A bookmark, huh... Hmm... You mean this thing? It was only on the second page.
You do realize that you have 1000 pages to go right?
Charley. A quite decorative plant.
Maya, we don't want to drown poor Charley.
(Does she want the office to look like a tropical rain forest or something?)
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
A poster of the newest member of the "Steel Samurai" universe.
Yeah, I heard that they're making a movie starring the new cast.
You don't say...
*yawn* Uh huh...
Alright already... I'll go see the movie!!
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel.
I don't see any way out of this. We're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
That's true... Moe looked awfully serious when he said that.
If that was it, he would have simply said "I saw Max". That would have been enough. There's no reason why anyone would believe "he flew".
(You're really not helping my confidence here, Maya...)
That magician does seem rather full of himself, doesn't he? Especially when he says things like customers only go to the circus to see him.
But what?
And it was proven that neither Ben nor Moe lied on the stand.
It was probably left at the scene.
Not really... It may be fun to solve mysteries, but don't forget this is a murder case.
There's even a feather stuck in it.
Moe's testimony, right? "He left the scene wearing that dumb silk hat!" That's what he said, but the hat was found on the ground at the scene.
No no no... It broke because Max cracked Ben over the head with it.
YEOW!!
Of course it didn't!! You hit me with a plastic bottle!!
It looks like a real glass stone. Its brilliance is amazing.
(I'll have to give this back to Trilo sometime...)
Especially since the only thing inside was a small bottle of pepper.
Tomorrow!? Don't get ahead of yourself Maya... Let's concentrate on today.
...
Of course I'm not... I have to find a criminal who has discovered the ability to fly.
What's the matter with you!? You know that people can't just up and fly!
Without their bag of tricks, magicians are incapable of magic. Besides, what's the likelihood someone set up a flying device at the crime scene? Near zero.
Umm... Maybe. But I get the feeling that would have been pointless...
What about this?
(She must have been trying to think up a joke or something.)
We're doing our best, Max. Just hang in there.
Well, it would surely be an unnecessary addition to your troubles with the law.
You seem awfully calm about that possibility...
Umm. The night of the crime... You didn't happen to fly off into the sky, did you?
International Grand Prix?
(Ambition, huh...?)
We're sorry to make you tell it again.
That's not how you earn a trophy Maya!
(Learn how to get thrown in jail?)
Max, this one of your uppi... I mean, excellent symbols, right?
Secret crash training! Whoa.
You never really get used to the feeling of being where someone's life was taken.
(Hmm... Something just isn't adding up here. I wonder who they really saw?)
(Poor Maya... She's so red she looks like a vine ripe tomato!)
That jerk?
Umm... Not to rain on your parade, but wouldn't a more mature song be best?
I dunno... But if she's with that tiger, I don't want to find out!! Let's hurry up and get out of here!
No no no no no... I'm just... Umm... Allergic to wild tigers!
That could have been when the Ringmaster put on Max's costume and went outside.
(Remind me to never invite her to my office.)
You look like you just got hit by a truck. Shouldn't you get some rest?
Being bossed around by a woman... I know how you feel.
Umm... I think he's waiting for you to laugh at his jokes.
(Looks like she's wound him pretty tight...)
(Once she's done with her investigation, I think I'll go up there and check it out.)
Moe's not here...
What do you think he is laughing at when he's all by himself?
(Hmm... He must really love his work...)
Moe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.
(Maybe you should start with spirit channeling... Just a thought...)
Well this is where Moe witnessed some craziness... (I mean, c'mon... A flying criminal... Jeez... If we had a normal judge, he'd never believe something like that...)
I still don't get why he went with carrots...
Phoenix: (I'd laugh, but I think Maya might not be too far from the truth.)
Clown equipment
He's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.
(He sure seems to have tried them all... But were any of them useful?)
(Yikes... He's in an awfully good mood...)
Umm...
...Because cafeteria Mexican pizza is possibly a weapon of bowel destruction?
(What's going on? He's being too nice...)
The kitchen is over here.
(Lemme guess... "What did the chef say to the chicken before dinner? Knife to meet ya!" It's gotta be something dumb like that...)
There are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic that night to clean up.
What are you talking about? You're gonna help too!
Yes. Moe. We got it.
It looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder.
What are those?
(So those burgers leave just as bad of a taste in your mouth as his jokes then.)
The chair's been knocked over.
What do you mean?
Are you 100% sure about your testimony today?
(I don't see a Psyche-Lock... He must be telling the truth.)
There's nothing over there.
Sure, as long as I'm not paying for it.
Is there anything else that's changed about this place?
(I wonder if he's actually thinking about this, or if he is setting up for a bad joke?)
(A quiet Moe is a good Moe in my book.)
Tell us! Tell us!
Piece of paper?
M-M-M-Murderer!?
Umm... When did you find this?
(Who in the world posted this thing...?)
(Just when you think it's impossible, Moe flashes a glimpse of maturity...)
(He's got a... Big... Bust? I wouldn't mind hearing more about Max's bust... Not that I'm into that sorta thing...)
So you don't know what was written on it, do you?
Who are "they"?
(I concede Moe's a clown, but I get the feeling he's not your average clown...)
The morning of the murder, it was posted on the wall in the cafeteria...
And company...?
You know... I've got a feeling I know what that is...
What does it say? What does it say? "To The Murderer! I have conclusive evidence of what took place. Meet at 10:00 PM tonight at the lodging house plaza."
That's when the murder took place!
The Ringmaster's tailcoat.
The Ringmaster must have liked things neat and tidy.
(All I can hear in my head right now is "Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!")
There's a message on the bulletin board. "I'm hungry so I'm off to get some hamburgers! Love, Moe."
(All of a sudden, I need a new partner... BAD!!)
Hmm...
Some sort of pager or something?
(Never seen a grown man so afraid of a girl still in her teens!)
Von... Von... Von... Karma!! (She really did appear!!)
Did you have to jump out and scare us like that? What can I do for you?
You mean the story of my defeat at your hands making the national news?
(I think she might be overestimating the importance of a win by just a smudge...)
Von Karma... It appears you got your hands onto something, eh?
(Anyone could. You couldn't hide that look of victory with ten paper bags on your head!)
"A conclusive witness"... You must mean the acrobat, right?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it already, you want to beat and destroy me. I can't worry about her. I've got to try and find out more information myself.)
!! Then... Then what's this "revenge" thing you're talking about?
"Him"?
M-M-Mi-Miles E-Ed-Edg-Edgeworth!!
Miles Edgeworth... Why would you even bring him up!?
(Edgeworth... The man who inspired me to become an attorney. I fought against him in a few cases... But after "that" case was over... He "vanished"...)
I... I...
After that case, Edgeworth was in a peculiar state, and he got worse everyday. He never set foot into court again... And then one day, he just vanished. All he left was a simple note at the prosecutor's office.
That was one year ago. It was right after you left to go back home.
Maybe you should hold off on the wild goose chases.
Maya, I already told you this once. Don't make me do it again. Don't bring up his name in front of me again, OK?
Von Karma?
I don't know if you are god's gift to prosecutors or not, but I've had about enough of you!! Him too!
Let's go. We need to talk with the performer on the third floor.
Y-Yes.
Ummm... How do you know my name?
One man's trash is another monkey's treasure.
He's even got a motorcycle exhaust. What do they call this thing? Oh... A tuba right?
Hey... It's a picture of Regina.
No objections here.
Acro must really love monkeys.
Acro, why did you join the circus?
It's such a shame.
(Hmm... I wonder if he spoiled Regina?)
(Hmm... Do I detect a hint of a grudge against Regina...)
And you can't walk now?
The accident happened during an acrobatics session, right?
(A Psyche-Lock! It doesn't seem like Acro's injuries were acrobatic in nature...)
Well... Exactly when were you injured?
(Six months ago... What in the world went on at this circus then!?)
(Acro's hiding what really caused his "accident". Maybe it's related to what happened to the Ringmaster?)
I stopped by yesterday and noticed that you weren't in your room.
Ahh... You went there for rehabilitation? What about the murder?
"What you saw"...? (Jeez, that sounded really ominous...)
What did you see, Acro?
H-He?
(That's what I thought he'd say...) Your absolutely positive that it was Max you saw flying?
Acro, please take a look at this photo for us...
(He seems awfully calm... But his eyes have a look of sorrow and profound pain...)
(Acro won't even look at it...)
That pile of "treasure" over there is his collection, huh?
That's what we want to know.
(W-What happened? He suddenly looks incredibly serious...)
What about you, Acro?
(This guy is really different from the other members of the circus...)
I was hoping you could shed some light on Ben...
W-W-W-W-WHAT!?
Y-You're joking, right!? You think I'm like that whip carrying demon!?
(I wonder what happened between Acro and Regina...)
(Who does he mean by us...?)
(I wonder if it's really alright to let Moe run the show...)
You can see right through me.
Must you always be so blunt?
(I've got a bad feeling about this...)
(Wonderful... Today's special must be Filet O'Phoenix!)
A m-m-mistake!?
(I hate to say it, but she doesn't seem all that broken up about her father...)
("When someone dies, they just become a star in the heavens." That's kinda sweet... But I bet you there's no way that Maya believes that...)
Yeah... You will. I think...
(I wonder if everything's alright with Regina...)
Huh?
(There's no way I could tun down that request...)
(She's already flown off into her own little world...)
Uhh... OK. I'll think about it.
(I've seen plenty of kittens... And that's no kitten.)
Huh? It's from the cafeteria?
(Hmm... So this was the cafeteria's pepper...)
Regina, have you ever seen this before?
I-It was in your pocket!? This piece of paper... Was in your pocket!?
Breakfast time?
And then what...?
Hmm... (So it was Regina who put it up there!) When did this happen?
(That explains a lot...)
(Strange is probably too nice of a word...)
Umm... *gulp* Of course. If I'm Wright, you're right!!
(Regina's so cheerful... It kinda makes you wonder if all the lights are on... Especially when she says she won't be able to see her dad "for a while"...)
Umm... No comment...
Yes, he is. We just came back from meeting with him.
(That's strange... Acro doesn't seem to have very many nice things to say about Regina... But Regina seems to like Acro just fine.)
(She's drooling like she' some sort of crazed burger monster!)
(Whoa... I'm getting hungry too! Those burgers must have some kind of special power!)
Like how he was adopted when he was younger?
He was that upset?
(The tragedy? You know? What is he talking about?)
"Get over" what tragedy, Moe?
(Doesn't he mean "ding"?) Moe... I mean no disrespect here, but... Are you lying to us?
Just the way you said "if everyone would get over it" seemed a bit strange. It sounded like you were talking about something from a long time ago.
Moe! I'm right!! Aren't I!?
(Hmm... So now we're getting closer to the truth.)
(Six months ago, eh...)
C'mon Moe. Tell us what happened six months ago.
(I just wish we could do something about Moe chewing with his mouth open...)
(Maybe it'd be best if I didn't tell Moe where we found it...) Don't worry, about it, Moe.
He was especially grateful to the Ringmaster... And I'm sure he is grateful to you too.
(He's fidgeting around so much, you can tell that he's embarrassed.)
There really isn't anything that we need to ask him right now anyway.
What's that!? I hear something...
That monkey's gotten his hands on something again...
(Alright! Time to take on this monkey, attorney-style!)
Give it back, monkey-brain!
That means a lot to Regina!! A real man wouldn't make a little girl cry!!
WAAHHH!!
I tried to have a man-to-man talk with him... I really did.
Stay! Money! Stay!
Hey, it's working!!
Stay... AHHHH!!
WAAHHH!!
I knew that acting like Regina would do the trick!
Oooh-Oooh-Oh-Oh!
Wa-Oooh-Oooh!!
WAAHHH!!
I tried to have a monkey-to-monkey talk with him... I really did.
I swiped it while Money was distracted...
Huh? You can see it fine from where you are.
(Maybe then they'll take you in at the circus and I can get some peace and quiet...)
What's the matter now?
Oh well, guess it's time for you to lay off the burgers! Not to mention it doesn't look like something any girl I know would actually wear.
Léon... He was killed, wasn't he?
During practice?
(You sure they were screaming because they loved seeing you do that!?) Anyways... What was the "bad thing"?
And that's then Léon...
Poor thing...
Don't mention it.
*blush* It's... Nothing... (No wonder guys melt to mush in front of this girl...)
Léon's?
(Ohh... The one that someone killed.)
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Moe, please tell us what happened six months ago. What in the world went on at this circus?
Unfortunately, I'm more of a grilled chicken sandwich man myself.
Actually... I've kinda got an idea of what happened back then.
Moe, you said something about an accident? This wouldn't happen to be the cause of that accident, would it?
Leads to:
What about this!?
W-What!?
(It looks like I shot a blank on that attempt...)
I heard a little bit about it from Regina? Léon made a mistake during a performance, right?
Putting their head inside of Léon's mouth was part of a act!?
Out of curiosity, who was bitten?
Come on Moe! Don't clam up on me now. Who did Léon bite on the head?
You promised?
(He's "involved" huh? Moe must be talking about...) Moe. Is this the person that you promised you wouldn't say anything?
Leads to:
Moe:
What's the matter?
Umm... What about the person who you promised to keep silent?
It must have been Acro, right?
Don't worry about that, Moe. Getting to the bottom of this accident may help solve what happened to the Ringmaster.
I need to know the truth about what happened to Russell. Please tell me what you know.
What!? How would that have been better!?
How is he related to Acro?
Huh?
(Everyone seems to fall in love with Regina...)
(A smirking lion... A flying murderer... Why does it seem that it's always Moe who catches all of these incredible events?)
Umm...
(There he goes again, acting like his normal lazy self...)
(We're back because Acro's hiding why his legs were injured! He was hurt in the accident six months ago! It would seem that he knows that we know...)
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
I have to ask you, how were you injured?
An accident during practice?
(He's lying... If that were the real cause, he'd have no reason to keep it a secret.) Acro, are you really telling me that a practice accident was the cause of your injury?
Leads to:
Alright Acro... Just tell me the truth.
What do you want to know?
(Yikes! It seems I'm off-track with this one...)
(He's right. I slipped up just now... I've got to rethink things.)
Six months ago, you were attacked by the lion. That's when you were injured.
(I know I'm on the right track. I just need to keep going...)
That's what I'm saying.
I'm not sure if "attack" is the best word to be using. You must have... battled the lion.
Because you had to fight it. You had to fight it to save someone.
Leads to:
So how about it, Acro?
Go ahead. What do you want to know?
Huh? (I must be going in the wrong direction.)
It was a shame what happened to your brother six months ago.
You tried to save him, didn't you? And that's how you got that terrible injury.
Yes, we learned about Bat from Moe. But he didn't mention anything about you in regards to the accident. I suppose it was just a slip of the tongue on his part. That's how I figured it out.
"Cut down at the same time..." That was where he slipped, and that's how I figured it out. You two ended up wrapped up in the same accident together, like always.
(I still haven't broken Acro's Psyche-Lock... He must have an incredibly deep seeded secret...) "It wasn't anyone's fault..." Do you care to explain more?
Acro, I know you are still hiding something from me... Maybe something you don't seem to like much is the reason you're being evasive.
Leads to:
What about this, Acro?
What?
(Argh! There's no way I can back pedal away from this...)
You always seem calm and collected, until you start talking about her. Saying things like she is "cruel"...
You know... Her tiger tried to attack me...
Twice.
...
But you still hate Regina! I've got proof of it!
(Doh! Maybe I overdid it again... But if I can hand something over to Acro, maybe it'll...) Here's proof that you had it out for Regina all along!
Leads to:
Acro:
Acro?
Huh?
Uhhh... (It looks like I picked the wrong piece of evidence... But there's gotta be something that works... I know it...)
Regina posted it on the bulletin board in the cafeteria. Before that, it was in her pocket.
You wrote this, and then you put it in her pocket... That's right, isn't it?
And that's when the accident happened?
What is it?
Hmm...
He?
I know!! Moe said the same thing...
Von Karma?
Preparations?
Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out...
(This is all beginning to come together now...)
No clues here.
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
You don't seem like you're* usual sparkling self today.
(Moe said that...?)
Yeah. She doesn't seem to realize what's going on... Or even where she is...
M-Moe.
Uhh... Top of the morning.
Well... I've got the feeling that today I'm going to face off against the real criminal.
If all I've got to worry about is how thin the tightrope is, I'm used to it already... It just means that I won't be able to press him like I can other witnesses...
I guess today we'll just have to do without our psychological warfare. Today we rely on evidence. It's the only way we'll get past Acro and to the truth.
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Poor Gumshoe...)
(Time to get to work! Or shall I say, time to walk the courtroom tightrope...)
Before we get that far, I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
...
In the words of Ms. von Karma, may I quote yesterday's proceedings... "There's no way that actually happened!"
You said that you were resting in bed. One would thus assume that you turned the lights off in your room, correct?
Your room is on the third floor, right?
And you said that you were resting in bed.
But you were still able to hear a sound from outside?
(Pressing Acro doesn't seem to get results... Hmm... Maybe something was contradictory with what he just said...)
N-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)
There is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!
Leads to:
W-What don't I get?
(W-Whoops!)
Are you sure it was a human being? It could've been a mannequin, or perhaps a large action figure...
(Damn... I just strengthened his testimony... I wonder if Acro's statement jives with the facts...)
N-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)
There is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!
Leads to:
W-What don't I get?
(W-Whoops!)
The light in your room was turned off then, right?
So with the lights off, you were still able to clearly see a human fly by your window?
(The more I press him, the less results I seem to get... But maybe there was something fishy with his latest bit of testimony?)
N-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)
There is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!
Leads to:
Judge:
W-What don't I get?
(W-Whoops!)
When did you start thinking that what you saw "wasn't a dream"?
I believe that the prosecution has done a bit of maintenance on the witness' memory!
(Don't sustain that!!)
Of course he is. Now the challenge will be to expose his lies in court.
You claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?
The silk hat.
Well... You should have tried looking down out of your window that night.
That's a shame, because you would have noticed the silk hat found on the scene.
Afraid not. No matter how you look at it, this is Max's silk hat.
No. This is a handmade, one-of-a-kind model made only for Maximillion Galactica. Which mean, Acro... That you've been fibbing on the stand!
Well, I opened my big mouth, and now I have to back it up...
Perhaps it is because Acro has a grudge agains the defendant! Which is why he is trying to frame Max...
Well... Umm... That's the thing...
It's obvious that what Acro saw, he didn't actually see at all, because it was a dream!
OWWW!! (I think your whip proved this isn't a dream just fine...)
... Your Honor! On this occasion, the defense accuses Acro himself!
Obviously we accuse him of the murder of Mr. Russell Berry!
Deadly serious, Your Honor.
...!!
(Hmm... He is staying rather calm and collected...)
Uhh...
It's impossible for Acro to be the murderer in this case. If that's the case, then it's natural for one to consider possible accomplices!
(Not good... Not good... This isn't going to end well.)
W-WHAT!?
I understand, Your Honor. *gulp*
Leads to:
(Uh oh... This is suddenly looking very very bad...)
W-W-W-WHAT!?
Hear what?
Foundation...
Leads to:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
(Arrrrghhhh!)
Not this time, Von Karma.
You're not going to sucker me into this one.
There was no accomplice! Acro planned and committed this murder all by himself!
Now I'm going to have to prove how it all fits together... I have to show how Acro murdered Russell Berry.
I know what I can't do. I can't stop now... If I stop attacking, I'm doomed!
Leads to:
There is no way he was anywhere but exactly right here!
OWWW!!
Yeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance?
(Arrrrgh!)
He was right here!
OWWW!!
Yeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance?
(Arrrrgh!)
He was obviously here the entire time.
Pretty simple, eh? Acro wasn't able to leave the lodging house by himself. There's only one answer to that... Acro didn't leave his room to kill the Ringmaster!
... Umm... That's it?
Yes, Your Honor.
Hmm... You've got a point.
But Maya, it's still impossible for humans to fly.
What is it?
(Hmm... How did he do it? That's the next course of this legal buffet...)
(She's right. I can't mess up here. I've gotta give this one some serious thought! I'm sure that Acro killed the Ringmaster... And he killed the Ringmaster while he was in his room... No doubt about it!)
Don't push it, Von Karma!
You aren't gonna suck me in this time. I'm smart enough to know when I don't have the cards to play and my hand sucks right now.
Uh.
Uhhh...
(It looks like this isn't going to pass muster...)
Easier said than done...
I'm going to present some evidence!
Leads to:
Judge:
Yeah, you're probably right. Umm... So as I was saying... This piece of evidence--
(Doh! He caught me...)
It is indeed. The problem is with the item that's shown in the picture.
It's quite a large bust. And because it is life sized, it is also very very heavy.
Heavy enough to guarantee a certain death. Especially if it was dropped from a third story window.
See! This is how Acro was able to kill the Ringmaster! With the force of gravity and Maximillion Galactica's ample bust!
A rather simple crime... Even if you were stuck in a wheelchair, it would be incredibly easy to commit...
Well, Acro is an acrobat! He should have more than enough upper body strength to carry something like the bust!
(He should be... He knows that I'm getting close to the truth!) Well well well, Acro. You can't run away from things this time... OWWW!!
Wh-What!?
(Von Karma... She's just using this "testimony" as a rouse to stall for time!)
There is absolutely no need for such testimony!
(Why can't he see things my way once in a while!)
(Argh! That woman will sink to any low to win a case!)
... I'd still like to proceed with my cross-examination.
(Grr... I can't let her get to me... I've got to focus...)
Have you ever lifted up the bust before...?
Money...? (That crazy monkey has lifted Max's bust before?)
So what have you been doing to keep in shape?
You don't say...
(Whoa whoa whoa! How did the discussion turn to me all of a sudden!?)
And why is that?
How long do you think your recovery will take?
Why do you say it would be impossible?
Well... I suppose you've got a point.
Huh?
That does make sense... (If only I could prove somehow... That Acro knew the location of the Ringmaster's head without looking down...)
Leads to:
If all you had to do was drop it, then it wouldn't have been a problem at all!
Leads to:
(Acro is strong enough to lift up the bust...)
Hmm... I wonder if he used some kind of tool to aim for the Ringmaster...?
I have to be careful. I have to find something that fits perfectly with the case.
Acro... You didn't really need to lean out of the window, did you?
You already knew ahead of time where the Ringmaster's head was going to be. Quite precisely I may add.
(But... But I did such a good job hinting...)
Maybe you should take a look at this... The key point here is the "wooden box".
The same. The question is, who placed the wooden box here?
When Ben and company saw the Ringmaster, they didn't see him holding the box. Which means... That this wooden box was already placed at the scene crime.*
The moment that the bust came falling down... Was exactly the same moment that the Ringmaster lifted up this wooden box. Which means that the answer to all these questions is now crystal clear!
There would be no way that it could miss the head of the victim!
(Finally! Some of these loose ends are starting to tie themselves up! Now I just gotta keep going! And there's only one way to go from here... Forward.)
It was Mr. Dingling, of course. He connected it to a rope, and then all he had to do was lower it down. OWWW!!
OWWW!! OWWW!! OWWW!!
That's why the box was so specially made!
Indeed! It had the most peculiar feature...
The box was a remarkable size!
Exactly! I think you can tell from the picture that the wooden box was very large. To lift it up, one would have been required to squat...
Moreover, the box is quite heavy! It weighs in the neighborhood of 20 pounds!
The box was a remarkable weight!
Just to lift up this wooden box would have required...
That's exactly what I was trying to point out! The box is also very large.
Do you recall what was inside the wooden box?
... Well...
(I think I might have outthought myself...)
That is correct!! To lift up the box, you'd have to squat down! Which means... That no matter who you are, your head would be in approximately the same place!
(Does she* even bother to listen to me anymore...?)
...!
What...!?
Of course I remember. It was on top of the table in the cafeteria.
Uhh... I kinda forget.
No no no no no... Let's not get carried away...
Arrrggghhh!
(Yep... We definitely have a problem here... But this is no place to get perplexed! I've got to get my wits about me and prove how things happened once and for all!)
Leads to:
Here is the evidence that proves how he carried it!
Hmm... OWWW!!
Ow ow ow ow ow ow... (And here I thought the bust was the deadly weapon...)
Everyone knows Money... He loves shiny objects of any size.
Of course he didn't order the monkey to steal it!! The monkey stole it on his own and then brought it back home.
Money lives in Acro's room.
Maybe you should put the whip down sometimes and read the Court Record!
Yes, and they are made of platinum... which is very shiny!
Acro!! Money is a strong monkey, right!? It'd be easy for him to bring the bust back to your room!!
Well, in that event... Something else must have been used as the murder weapon.
That's possible. Maybe Acro saw Money's mountain of stolen goods and thought to use one of them.
Anyways... I think we've more than proven one critical fact. Namely, that it was entirely possible that Acro was the murderer!
Fraud...?
And what is that?
AHHHHH!!
(I won't! This is my chance to turn this trial around!)
Leads to:
Judge:
Why is that?
Ohh...
He saw Max's B-- OWWW!!
Au contraire mon frére! It does indeed have something to do with the question!
Moe said that he saw Max's silhouette... But he did not actually see the man himself! It wasn't a human being he saw!
It's simple, really. What Moe actually saw that night was Max's bust!
There's no reason why you couldn't attach a cloak to the bust! Or a cloak like that could easily get snagged on the bust if they came into contact.
It doesn't matter who put it on the bust!
(Doh! He caught me...)
Leads to:
von Karma:
Uhh...
Well...
I'm... I'm sorry. (When she's so nice about telling me I'm wrong, it hurts even more...) OWWW!!
That's what I'm saying!
"Placed the cloak" isn't really the right way of putting it...
I'm fine, Maya. I'm finally putting all the pieces together... There's really only one picture I can paint, anyways. Alright... So you want to know what really happened that night? Let's step back in time. Acro used a rope to lower the wooden box onto the scene. Then he attached that rope to the bust, and dangled the bust out of his bedroom window, directly above the wooden box. At the same time, the Ringmaster told Max to wait in his room, and went to the scene. Of course, at the time, the
It's still a little early to be getting so upset, Ms. von Karma... This circus isn't over yet.
With the shock of impact, it threw up the cloak and it got snagged onto the bust. That's when the sound was heard by a witness and he took a look out of his window. That witness was, of course, Lawrence "Moe" Curls, the clown. When Moe looked out his window, the cloak had already snagged onto the bust. Now... Having completed the crime, Acro naturally went about pulling up the murder weapon. Of course, he had no idea that Moe saw the bust being raised with the cloak dangling on it. Primarily
Now you know how the murder actually took place... And now you know who was able to drop the murder weapon from above the scene! Acro! It could only have been you!
(He sure has... But he has come to the end of his rope now.)
What now!?
I just explained how there can only be one possible murder method. But there is still something unusual about Moe's eyewitness account.
A contradiction, actually.
Leads to:
von Karma:
(If they would have been silent for two more seconds, I would have screamed!)
The problem is Max's three symbols... You know... The silk hat, the cloak, and the white roses.
Yesterday, there were two contradictions in Moe's testimony.
But the theory I just presented explains all of these contradictions!
Max's silk hat was found at the scene of the crime. However! Remember what Moe said yesterday. He testified that the criminal he saw fleeing the scene was wearing a silk hat! There's only one explanation for that! The "silk hat" that Moe saw was actually the bust!
Of course! I can explain all of it!
Please recall the instant when the cloak snagged onto the bust! If the cloak snagged onto the bust, what happened to the white roses? Do you get it yet? If the cloak got snagged onto the front of the bust... It means that the white roses would end up on the back of the bust!
Which explains why Moe didn't see it! The white roses were not visible because they were on the back side of the bust!
What is it?
Well... Yes, I did... Is there something making you think that I didn't?
Umm... Why is that?
...!
(Acro's motive... Hmm...)
It's pretty shocking, isn't it?
Now now Detective. I'm sorry. Now, why don't you relax a little.
Huh?
"Final plans"...?
Hmm... Everything he said seemed pretty cryptic to me...
Just do me a favor and don't ask questions you don't want the answer to...
(Actually, that's the question I'm trying to answer myself... "Why would Acro kill the Ringmaster?"... This might be my last chance to answer that question.)
The defense has a right to cross-examine the witness!
"We"?
(He's got a soft spot for sob stories it looks like...)
How would you describe your relationship with the Ringmaster?
I know. He seems like a nice guy... (Which is what makes this so difficult.)
You started off as an acrobat at that early of an age?
(Liar!)
(The Judge keeps looking at Acro almost like a proud father...)
Did you ever have any trouble with the Ringmaster? OWWW!!
OWWW! OW-OW-OW-OWWW!!
I was trying to chase down the truth, but I ended up just looking like a jerk...
I dunno... I think the more I cross-examine him, the worse I end up looking in the end.
I get the feeling that this cross-examination was a trap.
There's no need to cross-examine this witness.
"Why was the Ringmaster murdered?" There is no need to delve into that bit of testimony when I know the answer already!
Go ahead, Your Honor.
Now that I've come this far, there is no way I could answer "No, I can't..."
Leads to:
That is correct.
What are you supposed to learn... Hmm...
(Drats! Now I'm really gonna have to think about this...)
OK... This time, I won't leave any doubt in your mind!
...
(Yeah... I didn't even have to think about it... It was obvious from the start!) Your Honor. The reason that Acro killed the Ringmaster is something that can't be proven.
That's because Acro had no reason to kill the Ringmaster at all. OWWW!!
If you want to jump to the end of things... Then, yes, that sounds about right.
Acro. You didn't plan to kill the Ringmaster at all, did you? The Ringmaster wasn't your target that night.
I'm saying that the target of this witness' murder plot was not the Ringmaster. He did not plan to kill Russell Berry!
Leads to:
This is OWWW! My evidence!! OWWW! W-What are you doing!? OWWW!!
(Erk! I'm so scared of what will happen, I can't even move to give him the evidence...)
Acro. You were really aiming for her that night, weren't you?
He could easily answer this question! If I'm wrong, all he has to say is, "You're wrong." That's it.
...!!
Leads to:
Judge:
It must be the special bond between whipper and whipped.
Acro... Do you have any recollection of seeing this?
It's a piece of paper that we found inside the Ringmaster's tailcoat.
Acro wrote this note. It's ironically entitled "To the Murderer!"... It's* purpose was to call someone to the plaza at 10:00 PM.
There's just one little problem...
Acro did indeed place this note into someone's pocket. However, that someone was not the Ringmaster!
That's exactly what I mean. The person this note was intended for was none other than Regina Berry!
It's the truth, Your Honor. It isn't a theory. Simply put, Regina didn't think the note was meant for her. Which is why, the morning of the crime, she placed it on the cafeteria bulletin board.
That's correct. The ringmaster ended up in that plaza instead of Regina! And he was killed because of that mistake... Instead of Regina!!
Remember the testimony that Acro gave us earlier today!
Acro had no idea who it was that arrived in the plaza... Because he couldn't look down out of his window to see who it actually was.
And that's when he let the bust fly.
She is. Unfortunately, it's only going to get harsher from here.
Uh huh. That's a line in the note alright.
You just don't get it, do you?
The Ringmaster knew what the note meant! Which is why he went to the plaza. ...In place of his lovely daughter!
(The incident six months ago...)
... Urk! Umm... Well...
(This is getting ugly... All I can do to get out of this mess is... I have to prove the truth about what happened six months ago!)
An incident occurred six months ago... And now I am more than ready to show this court what happened at that time!
It does indeed, Your Honor! Everything in this case has its start in what happened six months ago!
I... Umm... I think so.
(If I can't answer that question, the judge is going to think I'm bluffing!) The "conclusive evidence" about the incident six months ago is actually...
Leads to:
Judge:
Well... Umm... I kinda figured that I'd try and get rid of evidence I didn't need any more.
Whoops!
(I'm almost to the big climax of this case... Which means that, no matter what, I can't mess up again!)
It isn't a joke at all. It's the decisive evidence you asked for.
The victim would arrive and try to take away the wooden box. That's when they'd discover the decisive evidence found inside!
Taking the note into account, that's the only logical conclusion you can draw...
Leads to:
Maya:
I'm... S-Sorry. I was just... Umm... Practicing.
Yes, Your Honor.
That is Acro's younger brother.
Technically, that's true. However, Bat has been in a coma for six months now... It's not a stretch to see how Acro could feel that his brother is dead!
I suppose it was truly an accident...
(...Ugghhh...) ... (A small bottle of pepper... ...A lion... What's their connection...?) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
I figured it out! Wow... It was right in front of my nose the entire time! Your Honor... Wait!
The lion biting Bat was no accident at all!
She may not have incited the lion to attack another human being, but Regina is responsible for making the lion bite Acro's brother, Bat!
Leads to:
Maya:
Huh?
(Doh! ...I'm gonna have to think this over some more.)
Acro.
This scarf is something that Bat used to wear, correct?
And who is the one that gave this scarf to Bat?
There is something more than just blood on this scarf, Your Honor.
Pepper.
Pepper. Regina gave this scarf to Bat right before the accident! And she covered it with as much pepper as she could!
(Hey... What's with the silent treatment?)
Umm...
(It still seems like the judge just doesn't get it...)
Lions sneeze.
Léon didn't plan on biting Bat at all. ...In reality, all he actually did was sneeze. He sneezed because of all the pepper spread on the scarf!
Of course I do! It's the truth. The lion sneezed due to the pepper, and that's when Bat... Lost consciousness. Acro nearly lost his brother due to this accident! Or this "joke" as you put it. Which is why he tried to get his revenge... Against Regina.
...!
Are you telling me that what I said was... True?
... What do you mean by that?
Uhhh...
Murder weapon...
(The "bust"...)
(This is the last step... If I get this one right, the case is won!)
(It might be worthwhile to search Acro's room, but...)
I guess... I figured with you that's the least I should expect. You'd leave no stone unturned.
The defense requests to search the room of the witness, Ken Dingling!
What is it now?
(J-Just wait a second... Something's funny about all this...)
But... But... What about the scarf!? What about the note!?
Arrggh!
(Hmm... Where's the bust right now?)
(There's not even a single clue... How am I supposed to know where the bust is!?)
...Ack!
We need time to do WHAT!?!? OWWW!!
W-Whaaa!? Is he talking to me!?
H-Hey... Wait... You can't be serious...
(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step! Sink or swim... The only way through is forward!)
There is no doubt in my mind! The bust is somewhere around the Lodging House!
In fact, allow me to be even more specific as to its location! You can find it...
Indeed, it is in Moe's room!
That's simple... I couldn't think of any other rooms it could be in! OWWW!!
(Hmm... Maybe she's on to something here...)
L-Let... Let me try again!
Without a doubt, the bust is in... Acro's room. OWWW!! L-Let me finish... J-Just let me finish... OWWWWW!!
I'll... Uhh... Go back and think things over.
It's buried in the plaza!
Haven't you ever heard the old saying... "It was hiding right under your nose?" That about sums it up!
I should rethink that, shouldn't I?
It must be somewhere in the Berry Big Top!
To be specific, I believe it is in the Ringmaster's room.
OWWW!!
You're right... If I think things through, I should figure it all out!
Of course, it is obviously in the cafeteria!
That's easy enough... It's the messiest place in the entire circus! OWWW!!
(I wouldn't go that far. It's not that messy...)
Ack! I've gotta rethink things!
It is on the circus' stage!
Haven't you ever heard this the* saying... "You keep your treasure inside your castle." It's kinda like that!
Look's* like it's time to give things some more thought.
It's obvious! The bust is inside this very courtroom!
Allow me to pinpoint the location of the bust once and for all!
It's... Umm... Umm..................
Well... I'm just not really sure if I should say anything or not because the bust is... Under Your Honor's bench!
Arrrgghhh!
Double arrrggghhh!! (Ahh... I knew I had a bad feeling about that...)
It's... Umm... Umm..................
Well... I'm just not really sure if I should say anything or not because the bust is... Under the prosecutor's bench!
(...? W-W-Who is this girl? ... This is no time for me to be losing my memory!!)
Acro... I'm sorry to ask this, but do you mind if I take the blanket off your wheelchair?
Well... You are a big guy... And you have a pretty big wheelchair because of it... I just wanted to make sure you weren't hiding anything under that blanket. Because it seems to me that it'd be really easy to say... Hide a bust under there...
I think it's pretty amazing that you could laugh in your position... However, your lightheartedness doesn't change the fact that the bust is under there.
We all know that you couldn't leave the lodging house by yourself in your condition. That proved inconvenient when Ms. von Karma happened to search your room yesterday. If she had found the murder weapon in your room, it would have been all over. Which is why you had to hide it. In the only place that you could hide it... Under your wheelchair.
Which is why, Acro, I have to ask you again. Could you please remove the blanket from the wheelchair?
(Two of them...?)
Uh huh... You definitely couldn't tell by looking at her. I know I sure couldn't.
And that's why she covered the scarf in pepper...
That's when you decided to do something about Regina...
...
W-What do you want to know, Regina?
I think that's his plan... But what can you do about it? You did some awfully bad things to him, Regina.
(Yikes! It looks like I struck the final blow on Regina...)
He's not gonna do that to you, Regina.
Yep. Acro doesn't have any desire for revenge anymore...
Huh?
Acro didn't want to get caught for a reason. He wanted to see his brother open his eyes again...
That's so sweet of you, Regina.
(Well, hopefully this is enough to give her a little piece of mind...)
So what about this? No do you understand there's no need to worry?
(Doh! Looks like I made a mistake with that one...)
Amazing...
Umm... Regina, you're gonna help them out too, aren't you?
It seems like everything is going to turn out alright here...

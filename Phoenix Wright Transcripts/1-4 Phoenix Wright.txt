Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?
... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?
Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...
Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?
(So much for the rushing spring waters...)
*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?
?
... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?
(Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...)
(Gourd Lake again?)
(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--
Yipes! M-Maya!
We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!
Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!
I-I don't know!
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.
Mia's favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.
Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.
Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.
Well, what should we do?
(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)
Well? Got any good ideas?
You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.
(I suppose you're right...)
I guess it comes with the territory.
... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!
Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?
Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.
(Actually, he's right.)
(Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.)
Smile for the camera...
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.
Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Sorry...?
H-hey!
...
The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?
The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)
Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
What?
I don't believe it!
Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?
Huh?
Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.
Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.
Questioning people, probably.
Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)
Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?
(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.
Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.
Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
No...
Head-in-the... huh?
A witness?
(I care!)
U-unfortunately not...
(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.
Neither am I...
Who was this witness?
Was there only that one witness?
Talk to Santa.
You're not coming back, Detective?
So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?
Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!
Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?
Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?
I... see. How nice.
Um, good luck!
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)
Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a "wowsers," though.
"Samurai Dogs"...?
With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?
(Nope.)
Yeah.
Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.
Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.
The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.
A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.
Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. "Left - Boat docks" "Right - Exit"
A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads "Samurai Dogs"... Somebody needs to redecorate.
...and it goes "pop." Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.
C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?
(A popper... hmm.)
Nah, let's leave it.
(Maybe if you outer child would be quiet for just a moment, Maya!)
I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd it go?
Whoa! O-okay! Let's go check things out.
A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.
Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?
There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.
There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?
Huh?
They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.
(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.
Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.
Will you stop that?
D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)
The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.
The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
... I don't think they have signs like that.
There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.
What, don't tell me you're hungry again?
... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.
(I'm not having this conversation...)
This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.
This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.
Will you stop that?
D-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices?
The party popper...?
Yeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends?
(Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...)
Yes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...)
This camera is rigged to respond to noise. But it only responds to loud noises... like a party popper.
Ummm...
(That didn't work... I wonder if I have anything to show her that would get her attention...)
I, er, this is my badge.
Umm... I'm a lawyer.
N-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake.
(Finally! Some cooperation!)
(Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?)
It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve.
A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything?
Uh... so I hear.
What are you photographing?
(Falling stars...?)
(Isn't that where they make knives...?)
*glare*
Lotta?
So, your camera... it triggers on loud explosion noises?
Actually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol.
Right. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...?
Your camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it?
Huh?
It would have been a photo taken late last night...
(I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...)
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for arrests.
Do you know anything about the victim yet?
So, how did the meeting go?
T-true...
Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!
Y-yes, sir!
I was wondering, did you ever get that autopsy report?
Thank you.
Huh?
Someone you know?
(Maya seems lost in thought.) You remember anything?
(Guess not.)
Thanks, Detective.
What is it?
That office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office?
(That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.)
Well, what should we do?
Right.
Well? Penny for your thoughts?
It's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual.
(That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.)
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.
Uh, we don't need them.
(Hmm. It is kind of cute.)
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.
I don't know. I don't think I'm ready to sit at a desk like that yet.
You'd better start saving your allowance, then.
A big painting was hanging there until recently.
Uh... well, he gave it to someone.
Uh... yeah.
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.
Right. He's a really cute... plant.
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.
I'm not really into smoking.
Classy...
Wait...!
I-it looks like that, yes.
A-are you serious!?
(How do you forget... never mind.)
I... reckon so!
I... reckon no!
W-w-wait! Lotta!
T-tell us what you saw, too! Please?
(Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.)
An expensive-looking camera faces the lake. Next to it is a large microphone and a blue plastic sheet. Hmm. Looks like a computer is attached to the camera.
Don't be ridiculous!
L... Larry! What are you doing here!?
(K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...)
That... that's great, Larry.
Not my... what? N-no, she's not!
(Don't worry, Maya, he's not listening...)
I think not. It's too cold to sit and eat hotdogs out here!
I can't get over the Samurai Dogs...
Why don't you add "world-famous" to the sign?
(What have I done...?)
Hey, Larry. There was a murder here last night... You work here. Have you heard anything?
I think what you just said caught him off guard, Maya.
(A model. I knew it.) Well, anyway, there was a murder here on the lake. The trial's tomorrow.
The defendant is Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth.
Yeah. He's a murder suspect.
...
Umm... yeah. (It's probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there's a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What's this? "I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water..."
(Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry. Could I borrow this article from you?
(Grow up, Larry.)
(Cause you blow it all on "Kiyance"...!)
Larry... If you let her at your dogs, you won't have any left for the other customers.
(How many times do I have to remind you that it was ME who got you off the hook!)
It's a camera. You take pictures with it.
Oh, that. Well... it's hard to explain. Just forget about it.
Hey Larry, you know this guy?
I don't know. That' why I asked you.
Actually, the photo's blurry, Larry. It was taken last night.
Uh oh...
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for trailing.
Edgeworth... Did you shoot him?
I don't think you're the kind to point a gun at anyone, no.
(Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat!)
I was her understudy, yes. Phoenix Wright.
Um, Mr. Grossberg, sir?
There was a murder last night...
You haven't heard...?
Well, Miles Edgeworth shot someone with a pistol.
Well, the identity of the victim is still unknown.
(I guess he hadn't heard anything...)
Mr. Grossberg? Whatever happened to that painting?
Who is this Hammond guy, anyway?
"That case"...?
"DL-6"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?)
(I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.)
They never caught the criminal, right?
... (DL-6... Never thought I'd hear that name again...)
Aww, just go on and take the compliment, will you?
Did you remember!?
Yes.
(Now that I've shown her the picture, I can't think of anything to say... That probably wasn't the best thing to do.)
Edgeworth, what about your defense?
(Guess he hasn't found anyone yet.)
Can I ask you about the murder?
...
Why did you go to Gourd Lake?
Nor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe.
And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
"About to end"?
What!?
When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.
(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)
Edgeworth?
About the "DL-6 Incident"...
So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?
?
Ah, who could have guessed this day would come?
Sorry, charley! No way!
H-hey, don't look so serious, guys! I was kidding! Just a little joke!
(I thought it was funny...)
Yes, Your Honor. How could I refuse you, Edgeworth?
This is my chance to finally pay you back.
Never mind... I guess you don't really need to know.
Well, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!?
...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth?
(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)
Uh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe.
W-what's wrong, Detective?
(Lotta Hart...)
N-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!
No sir!
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for a stake-out.
So... what did Ms. Hart say?
Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.
(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)
(A "cancellation"...!?)
(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)
Look what I got.
Thanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.
(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.
I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.
(Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade. He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...)
No clues here.
Karma...?
Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.
(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)
Wh-what!?
(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?
We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?
?
You couldn't "reach"?
Oh man, what bad timing!
I hope so!
O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(He's even got the Judge scared!)
How am I supposed to fight against this!?
(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)
(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)
(No he's not!!!)
You received a call from a "man"?
But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?
Different people?
(Urk!)
(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)
How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?
That's pretty fast!
What was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?
(Man, he's got his share of objections...)
Why didn't you think he was suspicious?
(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)
Did you find any clues on the body?
W-why is that?
The murder weapon...?
What about the pistol made it "decisive evidence"?
(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)
Wh-what!?
I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.
Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?
(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)
(Who's running this court, anyway!?)
Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!
And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!
Was that you in the boat?
What!?
Th-then who did!?
You don't know!? Weren't you right there!?
Y-you mean it was a suicide!?
Huh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?
Any progress with Mia?
Ugh...
No, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?
Um, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)
(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.
Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!
Oh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!
...!
"Contempt of court," you know?
I... think I noticed one little thing...
Y-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)
Honestly, I found nothing.
I bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.
He'll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.
But if we mess up... contempt of court.
Er... right.
I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!
"Just after midnight," you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!
Mmmph.
Why were you camping there, anyway?
(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)
Ms. Hart. Could you be more specific about your "research"?
(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)
(I think I'll let that one slide for now.)
So, you weren't looking at the lake at that time?
(Urk...)
Could you clearly see the two men?
(Uh oh...)
Wait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!
(He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!)
(I think I'd best let that one slide...)
Were you watching the very moment the shot rang out?
(von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?)
Are you sure about that?
(That sounds pretty sure.)
How come you're so sure?
("Scanned the whole lake"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you--
Mmph!
(Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?)
(Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I'd better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.)
(Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!)
(Maya's really taking this hard.)
B-but, Your Honor!
Uh... uh huh.
I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?
(Maya!)
(No... No...!)
Wrong!
(Dammit, he's right...)
I... don't think there is. The cross-examination is over already!
...! Y-you're right! Your Honor!
Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!
M-Maya...!
(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)
Well, what about the other man?
(Damn...!)
Leads to:
(That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)
Got you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!
Look at this photograph.
The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.
This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?
Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!
(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)
(This one'd better be good!)
So? How could you see Edgeworth!?
(Nobody loves me...)
Your "camera"...?
(Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!)
"Binoculars"?
Yesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct?
Wouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that?
I've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?
You can't say that for certain!
(This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...)
Okay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I'm dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I'll hang back for now and see what happens.)
Ms. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing.
You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!
I saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart!
You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!
Take a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not?
You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake!
If there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all?
Even binoculars can't see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him?
(Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.)
(I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!)
The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!
Well... that I don't know.
(Uh oh... I can't let the trial end like this! I have to show them something!)
Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?
Leads to:
Well, Your Honor? What do you think?
Y-Your Honor! Enough playing around! Here's the real evidence!
Uh...
Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!
Well, Ms. Hart?
Well, I don't have proof...
Well all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence!
(I'm sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I'd get mad and make a mistake?)
I have it! Proof!
The proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!
You camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake.
And here, this article about "Gourdy." According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!
The proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!
According to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired!
Here's my proof! It's simple!
Urk...?
(Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)
(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?
Huh...?
(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)
(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)
I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)
(Hah hah, very funny.)
Yes, Your Honor.
Then what manner of person are you!?
An "investigative photographer"?
Umm... what?
A "yoofoh"...?
I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)
Is "Gourdy" really all that newsworthy?
(I'm not sure that appearing on the local news "rumor of the month" show qualifies. Last month's show was "Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill," I believe.)
Yes, Your Honor.
That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera?
It snaps a shot.
So, how many pictures has it taken so far?
(Hmm...)
I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.
Competitors...?
Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?
(Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.)
Exactly what sort of sound was it?
(Hmmm...)
Leads to:
There wasn't "much else to look at"?
(I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she'd waste any time looking at a boat.)
(Definitely suspicious... Maybe it's time for some evidence...)
Leads to:
Was there nothing on the lake but the boat at that time?
(Hmm...)
Leads to:
(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)
Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?
I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!
You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!
You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!
Well!?
(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.
(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)
(If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?)
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
(I have to fight now or I could lose everything!)
Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?
Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!
Hmm... (There has to be something!)
(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)
W-wait! Your Honor, This evidence...
(Uh oh... think of something! No good... I guess I'll just sit back and see how this turns out.)
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!
(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)
Leads to:
Here, your honor!
(Specific, right...)
Here, Your Honor!
Y-Your Honor! Never mind that... my, my finger slipped! Please let me show you again!
Here, Your Honor!
Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!
That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!
Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!
Leads to:
(Hmm... I'm not sure this warrants a "take that!" I'd better think this one through!)
Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away!
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!
Yes, Your Honor.
Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!
(Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.)
(Uh oh. The Judge is mad.)
(Wait, wait--I can't do that. Sacrifice one friend to save another? What's the point!?)
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.
Wh-what!?
The... distance?
A meter! Th-that's three feet!
Yes, Your Honor.
Whew, that was a close one.
Hey! Don't you have anything to say!?
Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!
I was just kidding around.
Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.
What?
What?
(Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!)
I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the "bang" she heard.
Maya!
Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway?
Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?
Have you been questioned yet?
Whew...
Huh? How much?
(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)
Any luck with Mia...?
(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)
I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...
Uh huh.
(Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)
If he really exists.
(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)
Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that!
I'm... not really sure.
Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.
(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)
... Sure is quiet here with nobody around. Right... I have to get Maya out of that detention cell soon!
(Detective Gumshoe's not here...)
Huh? Oh, really?
(Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...)
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
(He must be playing chess on the computer...)
Apparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything.
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.
I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.
There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a "nature park." It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.
Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...
The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really.
(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.
There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.
Hey, Detective Gumshoe!
Yes? What about the trial?
Er... thanks.
Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.
I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.
Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?
Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...
I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?
(Right...)
Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.
Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.
The DL-6 Incident?
I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...
Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)
Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.
(Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?)
But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.
He seemed fine in court today...
(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)
From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.
What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?
Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)
Huh? How should I know!?
But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!
Where was the third shot fired?
Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?
What? Edgeworth...?
(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...)
Free at last, eh?
Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?
Thank Edgeworth.
He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.
What do you think we should do next?
...
Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?
Have you noticed anything lately?
I meant have you noticed anything about the case...?
(She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)
Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?
It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.
(Oh dear...)
Well, what should we do?
Well? Any thoughts you want to share?
(Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...)
Looks like Edgeworth is in questioning.
Guess so...
They're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth.
Wh-what did we do now?
Lotta...
"Make it up"...?
What did you think of the trial?
(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)
What about Gourdy?
(Finish your spirit medium training first!)
Lotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?
E-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?
...
(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?
I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you!
Right...
No kidding. If we didn't have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse!
Umm...
(Thanks for the cheerful message of support!)
(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!)
(It's painfully easy to know when something doesn't catch Lotta's interest...)
Huh?
B-but Gourdy doesn't... I mean, Gourdy might not exist!
Uh...
O-okay...
...
H-hunting...? You don't seriously mean...
What about Edgeworth!?
(Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?)
Wh-what's that?
Larry! What the heck is this!?
Right...
Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky...
...? The war of the what!?
What the heck is it?
(I ask again, what the heck is it!?)
Doesn't that Steel Samurai look a little out of place? I mean, it's so huge... I guess it's good advertising.
Huh? Really? It looks pretty well made to me.
(These Steel Samurai fans are obviously in a league of their own...)
Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though.
(Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn't look like Larry knows about it, though.)
Hey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before?
Why wasn't it there yesterday?
Well, with the murder on the lake and all... They're probably just taking a vacation till it blows over.
(*sob*)
Whoa--didn't you say you had information about the case!? Tell us that, at least!
What do you mean, "again"!?
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for making arrests.
How is the investigation proceeding?
(And Edgeworth never talks about his past... I bet they'll drag that out and hit him with it in court tomorrow, too...)
I told Detective Gumshoe about the deal with Lotta.
Er, sorry.
(A cute dog... And this will help us... how?)
Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for a monster...
How are we supposed to catch a whole sea monster with a fishing pole!?
...!
(No, please, I'm already overwhelmed by our choices.)
Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for something alive.
How are we supposed to find it with a metal detector!?
I can't make up my mind, either... for the totally opposite reason. (Oh well, I suppose it can't hurt to borrow one of them.)
Can we borrow Missile?
(Oh boy...)
Can we borrow that flimsy-looking fishing pole?
Er... right.
Can we borrow that metal detector?
I'm not sure what we're going to find with this...
Detective Gumshoe, can we borrow one of the other things?
Can we borrow Missile?
(Oh boy...)
Can we borrow that flimsy-looking fishing pole?
Er... right.
Can we borrow that metal detector?
I'm not sure what we're going to find with this...
(Must have been one of those mid-life crisis things...)
(I'm not so hopeful...)
Hmm?
"Missile"? Oh, oh right. That little... creature of yours.
I'm sorry, Larry...
Ah hah hah... (It's going to have to this time...)
Maya... I think you should probably try to look a little sorry about what happened.
A good spot... for what?
(She's serious...) Umm... What are you going to use for bait?
Yeah. "Oh."
I figured something like this would happen. We should have brought Missile along with us, too. At least then we'd have bait.
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
(Oof! She hit me!)
Just try not to reel in any empty cans or boots, okay?
(Dear, dear...)
(I don't believe it...)
Sure it loud enough about it. (Whatever it is, it must be in those bushes...) Go check it out, Maya.
Huh...? An air tank? Huh. The valve looks broken.
Maya, first of all... Why would Gourdy be in the bushes!? And second of all, why would a metal detector react to a sea monster!?
Huh? (There's something wrapped around this air tank... It looks like... a string of flags...?)
(It's heavy...)
Hmm... Detective Gumshoe isn't here...
Ah, that's right... Let's come back later.
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for negotiating a hostage situation.
(The 20th... a week ago.)
(The night before last... was the night of the murder!)
It's not all bad. We've solved one mystery at least.
(Maybe we should go tell her...)
Larry... I wanted to ask you about this tank...
Have you seen this before?
(There's something about the way his eye twitched when I showed him the tank... I think I'd better pursue this line of questioning a little further...)
Say... is this air tank yours?
Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there.
You used this to go diving in the lake, didn't you?
N-no, not at all, just...
Well, Larry? She's right.
(Yeah, right... Larry is hiding something, I can tell...)
You used this to inflate that, didn't you?
What else? That big puffy Steel Samurai!
(Looks like I hit the nail on the head.)
(As I suspected!)
(I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!)
It "didn't go so well"?
Do you think you could be a little more specific?
Me too.
It's not going to be that easy to find him, you know.
(Uh oh...)
Huh? Gourdy? Oh, we found him already.
I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there.
(Great, now they're both mad at me.)
Of course I have proof.
Leads to:
Lotta:
(We need to do something soon or I won't get that information off of her!)
Lotta... There is no such thing as Gourdy.
The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...
I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there.
(Great, now they're both mad at me.)
Of course I have proof. No lawyer worth his badge would make a claim without proof to back it up. Here's the proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...
Leads to:
Lotta:
(Great, the "investigative photographer" is giving me career advice...)
This... is Gourdy.
There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud "bang" when it flew...
The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!
I'm sorry, Lotta.
So, tell us this "information" you have.
Something else?
It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.
Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
You're right. Doesn't seem to be anyone around at all.
Uh, I think I'll leave this one up to you, Maya.
A parrot... the one on the perch.
Y-yes!?
Um, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop.
I guess he's relieved.
Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that.
Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there!
This fishing pole looks expensive.
And what, talk about murders?
(Maya's found a new friend.)
Umm... a pasta shop?
Y-yes?
R-right, of course. Everybody knows that.
Huh?
(This old man must know something about the murder...! We're not leaving until we find out what that is.)
Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right?
I'm pretty confused myself.
But this old man is the witness tomorrow, right? We've got to find some way of getting information out of him!
(And a criminal mind...)
H-hey! Don't get me involved in your little heist schemes.
(It was after midnight, but okay...)
Y-yes, it is! (I don't believe it! This old guy is the first person to recognize my badge!)
Huh?
...
Umm... sir. No, I'm not Keith.
We're here investigating a murder that took place on this lake the other night.
I can't make that promise.
Not to mention he still thinks we're his kids. (Maybe we should just lie and say we'll run his shop?)
Okay, we promise.
Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat "Phoenix Noodles"?
W-wait, didn't I just say...
(Now he's talking to the bird again! How do we get him to talk to us!?)
Uh, um, I think I'll hold on to it if you don't mind.
You know about Gourdy?
Y-you know something about this, sir!?
Y-yes?
... D-Dad! You know something about this!?
(That didn't seem to work the way I thought it might.)
(He fell asleep...)
"Terry"...?
(He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...)
(Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving.
Huh?
One more time, Polly!
(What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad!
(This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?)
We have to figure out who that old man is.
What?
(... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.)
Actually, we wanted to ask you something...
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for dying in action.
You know the boat rental shop down at Gourd Lake?
The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right?
Detective Gumshoe, please, help us...
We need to know about the DL-6 Incident!
That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case.
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful.
The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that "incident"...
DL-6.
I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...
Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?
(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)
Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.
(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)
O-oh, thanks!
It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.
They must keep important case files in there.
There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Don't touch that! It's evidence...
Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.
Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.
Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.
December 28... 2001.
(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.
Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.
At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!
There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.
One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.
(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)
Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?
Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.
Miles Edgeworth, of course.
From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)
Got any data on the suspect in there?
The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.
But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.
Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.
(He may be closer than we think...)
I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...
Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...
Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...
No clues here.
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)
(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)
(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)
Leads to:
(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)
(Hmm, she has a point.)
Leads to:
Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!
(Yeah, right!)
What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!
(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)
(O-oh... right.)
"Just after midnight," you say?
Are you sure?
When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!
Ah, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.
And where did the "bang" seem to come from?
Was there someone in the boat?
But you couldn't see them clearly!
(At the time...?)
So you heard two gunshots total?
(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)
"By your window"?
And, could you see the man's face?
(I have a bad feeling about this...)
Leads to:
(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)
A-are you sure!?
(Uh oh!) D-Dad!
(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)
(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)
Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!
Exactly!
(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)
(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)
Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can' t believe he's dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...
Urk...
(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)
It's no good! There's nothing I can do.
To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.
(W-what!? No!)
Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!
(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)
You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!
Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.
(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.
Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.
Yeah.
Hey, Edgeworth.
Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?
Hmm?
Yeah?
Our chance?
Perfect trials...?
What are you getting at?
Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)
(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)
(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)
Yes, Your Honor...
It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.
...
There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...
Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?
And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?
"Looking for something"...?
(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)
Around what time was that?
(People use watches these days, Larry...)
Where did the sound come from?
Wasn't there a boat on the lake!?
(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)
So, you only heard one "bang" correct?
(Huh.)
Leads to:
Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.
W-wait a sec, Larry!
You only heard one "bang"!? You're sure!?
But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two "bang"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!
Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?
Huh?
...
Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?
Something... else?
Whaaaaaaat!?
(No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.)
Uh...
Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.
(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)
(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem is.)
Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!
An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!
(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)
So, you turned on the radio?
(I shouldn't have said anything...)
Do you by any chance remember the name of the program you were listening to?
Real "booming" loud?
Can you prove that...? No... no, of course you can't.
What did he say?
(Hmm... right. I didn't really have a deep reason for asking that question, now that I think about it.) Understood, Your Honor. I withdraw my question.
(This is getting nowhere...)
We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should!
Uh. W-well, how do you know if we don't ask, hmm?
Are you sure?
(Hmm... maybe von Karma was right. I'm not sure how that helped us at all.)
Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!?
Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" when he heard the gunshot!
"Almost Christmas" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!!
But he should have heard that gunshot after midnight! This photograph is irrefutable proof of this fact!
Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!?
Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" when he heard the gunshot!
"Almost Christmas" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!!
But that contradicts the two testimonies we have heard, Your Honor! Both Ms. Hart and the old man said it was after midnight when they heard the shots! In other words... When they heard the gunshots, it was already Christmas!!!
(This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard. But there is one gleaming ray of hope in there! I've got to press it until we get to the bottom of what happened!)
This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!
Well... I guess, it had to have been Larry's mistake.
...
Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor! He heard that gunshot before midnight!
Leads to:
Karma:
(In other words, I picked the wrong evidence to show him...)
Look at this photograph! This was taken by our witness yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, with her automatic camera. The timestamp on the photo reads "December 24, 11:50 PM."
Your Honor. The real issue here is not why nothing is shown in the photograph. It is why this photograph exists at all!
Your Honor... This photograph was taken by an automatic camera. That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises!
Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words... When Larry heard that gunshot, it was most definitely Christmas Eve!
Not at all, Your Honor. It is a fact that the camera also triggered at 15 minutes after midnight! Your Honor! That night, there were two sets of gunshots, with a 25 minute pause between them!
Leads to:
Judge:
Er, Your Honor... sorry, I wasn't really sure about the evidence.
This is my evidence.
Something about this pistol was bothering me, Your Honor. Both of the witnesses who testified yesterday heard two gunshots. However, the murder weapon was fired three times. When, then, was the last shot fired? Only now have I realized the truth. That third shot was the shot Larry heard just before midnight!
(Uh oh, I'd better think of something quick! ... Wait a second...! Gunshots separated by 25 minutes...?) Aaaaaaaaaaah!
I have it! I have it!
Remember the case with the Steel Samurai!?
The murderer in this case had the same idea as the murderer in that case!
Maya!
If we don't figure this out now, we'll never overturn Edgeworth's guilty verdict! I've got a hunch, and I'm going to run with it...
Safe? We've already gotten a guilty verdict! We have nothing to lose!
You just watch and let me know if I say anything that sounds fishy, okay?
Your Honor!
The testimony just now has cleared up this entire case!
Wrong, von Karma! A man was shot that night, but it wasn't Edgeworth who did the shooting!
Yes... But this assumes that the victim was shot at 15 minutes after midnight.
But Larry heard a gunshot 25 minutes before that! Robert Hammond was killed then! 25 minutes before the shot on the lake! (That's the only way that Edgeworth could be innocent!)
It was the murderer and Robert Hammond!
Y-yes, that's right.
Er, right, Your Honor. (Crash and burn...)
(*sigh*)
Miles Edgeworth and Robert Hammond!
Y-yes, that's what I said! I was just testing you, von Karma!
(*sigh*)
Of course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer! After the murderer killed Robert Hammond at 11:50... He assumed the guise of Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth!
Yes. Edgeworth won't tell us why he went to the lake that night. However, I have a hunch. That night, Robert Hammond called Edgeworth to the lake. Now, Edgeworth didn't know Robert Hammond's face that well. That's why he didn't suspect anything when the murderer took Robert Hammond's place!
The murderer's name...? Right! It's...
(On second thought, that's a really dumb answer... I might get a laugh or two out of the crowd, but that's about it.)
Huh? Oh, uh, nothing. Hah hah. *groan*
Y-yes, Your Honor!
The murderer is none other than Ms. Lotta Hart!
Um, yes.
Y-yes, well, she did look sort of manly.
...! It was... Lotta Hart.
... I guess... they wouldn't.
(Whoops.)
(Uh oh, he looks suspicious! I'd better bluff and bluff good!)
Actually, I don't know the murderer's name.
I don't know because he never told us!
The murderer is the caretaker of the boat shop, that old man! At 11:50, he was the one who killed Robert Hammond.
Why would he have to go all the way out on the lake just to shoot someone? May I suggest... That the real scene of the crime was not in a boat!
(Show the judge where the murder really took place!)
Leads to:
It was here!
Yes.
It was probably an honest mistake.
No, I did.
Around here, maybe?
Yes, well... Maybe because there's no good reason, the murderer knew we'd never expect it!
(He wasn't even surprised I goofed up.)
Here, of course! The boat shop, where he lives. That way he could meet with the victim without anyone seeing!
Recall Larry's testimony if you will. That night he was out on the lake in a boat, searching for something. He finds it, and returns the boat. Then, just as he's starting to head for home, he hears a gunshot! He heard a gunshot, Your Honor! Even though he was wearing headphones at the time! In other words, the gunshot was very, very close by! And where would that be if he had just returned a boat?
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Um, not really. But, I think if I start at the very beginning... And I take it slow, I must just be able to figure this out...
That night... The caretaker of the boat shop called Robert Hammond to his shop. This was around 11:50. That was when the gunshot that Larry heard was fired. After that, the caretaker put on Robert Hammond's coat... He became Robert Hammond! Then he got in the boat with Edgeworth, and went out into the middle of the lake.
It was Miles Edgeworth...
Uh, yeah. Good thinking!
Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol. He shot twice. Both missed Edgeworth, on purpose.
Y-yes?
Uh... (Details! Details!)
B-because the first shot missed?
Yeah, he was aiming for Edgeworth, and he missed...
Huh? Oh, uh, right. (Uh oh... I'd better figure out just what it is I'm trying to prove here.)
I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor.
The murderer lifts his pistol and fires one shot. That ensures that anyone who heard the shot would look at the lake. Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly that after hearing the first gunshot. Next! The murderer waits a bit and he fires again. Then... The murderer jumps from the boat himself! Leaving the pistol in the boat behind him.
The murderer didn't know about the automatic camera, of course. That's why he shot twice to draw attention to the boat!
Once you realize that, everything else falls into place! The boat shop caretaker swam back to his shop. Then he put Mr. Hammond's coat back on the body. And threw the body into the lake! This is what happened, Your Honor. These are the events that transpired that night on Gourd Lake.
Yeah... Well, at least we got out from under that guilty verdict...
Sure, once I sifted through his "unique" testimony. Still... he did save us. I just wish our cases weren't so down to the wire all the time.
Hey, Edgeworth...
Wh-what do you mean?
Edgeworth?
What is this about, Edgeworth?
A crime you committed?
... I don't believe it. Not Edgeworth. Some painful memory has been troubling him recently... But he'd never take someone's life! Never!
H-huh? Me!? I... uh, well, maybe my heart skipped a beat or two...
(I'm glad someone's happy about how this case is going... He seems too happy to care about anything I show him.)
... Looks like Edgeworth is back in questioning.
Yeah, I guess so.
(Hmm... Looks like Detective Gumshoe hasn't gotten back yet.)
(The boat shop caretaker...)
(Good luck, Gumshoe!)
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for a nasty divorce argument.
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
(He must be reading predictions for the future on someone's homepage.)
He's out... again.
Now, now. Don't be harsh. (Guess we'll have to come back later.)
Larry... You really helped out in the trial today.
...
I don't know. But... what I do know is... I'm going to believe in you two until the end.
Yeah, you, Larry.
...
... You didn't know him back then. Back when he wanted to become a defense attorney.
Yes. In grade school... They saved me... Miles... And Larry. They saved me and I'll never forget it. That's why I became a defense attorney, you know.
Okay, okay. It's kind of a long story, so hang in there. ... It was the beginning of Spring, 4th grade. I was on trial. A class trial.
You remember, Larry? Spring, 4th grade? A kid in my class got his lunch money stolen.
Our school was really small. Every month, kids would bring in an envelope with money for lunch from home.
Anyway, this kid's envelope disappeared. With $38.00 still inside.
I can see why you'd forget, though. You were out of school that day. Anyway, the envelope had been stolen during PE class. I was coming down with a cold, so I'd skipped PE that day. I was the only one not in class.
Yeah. The kids in class said I should be put on trial.
So the next day we held a classroom trial, with me as the defendant.
"I... I didn't do it!"
In the end, even the teacher thought I'd done it.
I... I didn't know what was happening. I was so sad... I couldn't stop crying. Everyone was staring at me like I'd done it... I tried to apologize. I went over to where the boy was sitting... ... That's when it happened.
"No..."
That's how it happened. After that, the three of us were always friends.
That's what I learned what it meant to be alone. Totally alone, without a friend in the world.
("When something smells, it's usually the Butz.")
Anyway, Edgeworth and I talked after that class trial. That's when I heard his father was a defense attorney. I remember, his eyes would shine when he talked about his father.
Then, a few months later, he suddenly transferred to another school.
Right. I'm not sure, but the transfer probably had to do with his father's death.
... It was several years later when I heard Edgeworth's name again. There was an article about him in the newspaper. The headline was something like "Dark Suspicions of a Demon Attorney." Fabricating evidence, manipulating testimonies, covering up facts... The article said he'd do anything to get a guilty verdict. Anything.
That's what I thought too. I tried to get in touch with him I don't know how many times... He never replied.
I couldn't just drop it, though. I wanted to meet him, to know why he had become who he became. That's when I decided.
If I was a defense attorney, I knew he's have to meet me whether he wanted to or not. In court. ... Edgeworth believed in me, and I believe in him. He's in pain... And no one's on his side. I'm the only one who knows the real Edgeworth. I'm the only one who can help him.
Uh... yes. I helped you because I believed in you. (Except I don't remember saying I'd do it for free...)
Right. (It very well may be...)
I'd settle for who. (I guess I can clean out some of this evidence I no longer need... ...) Okay, let's go!
You look grim as always.
Well, it probably only really mattered to me anyway.
(Gee... thanks.)
Well, maybe yeah, but... I think you changed too much, Edgeworth.
Hey, Edgeworth. Why did you become a prosecutor, anyway? You used to look up to your dad... You said you wanted to be a defense attorney, right?
What do you mean?
(That would be Robert Hammond...)
Lost your memory?
What's your relationship with von Karma?
Um, Edgeworth? If what you're saying is true, you're headed for a guilty sentence tomorrow!
(No kidding.)
Um, uh, no reason.
Hah hah.
(Tomorrow... Could that be a coincidence?)
(You're right... Now probably isn't a good time to dredge up those old memories...)
Uh, um, n-nothing.
Uh... Sorry about that.
(Where Lotta was camping?)
Huh? The Steel Eyesore is missing...
Looks like the hotdog stand is closed, too.
Huh?
I guess you're right.
A trashcan with no trash. At least the place is well maintained.
(How would that change the temperature, I wonder?)
N-no, who? Me?
Guess Larry has today off.
True. We owe him big.
Yep.
...! (I'd know that clearing-of-the-throat anywhere!)
Well... I'm not so sure about that.
Well... I'm not sure.
Thanks... (Bye...)
Who knows...
There's a forest here beyond these bushes.
... You're right. There's a few policemen in there.
Good luck...
The boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around.
Yeah, looks like it.
...
You're right.
What, you thought he was telling the truth!?
Uh, yeah, I guess so. You mean picture of the fish they caught, right?
Well, you know what they say... "You shoulda seen the one that got away!"
(Why do I feel like we're having two different conversations here?)
This fishing pole looks expensive.
Don't you think the caretaker would mind?
Uh... maybe we'd better not.
Hmm. Everything's cold. Looks like he didn't turn his heater on. I guess he hasn't been back here since the trial.
W-what's wrong?
What? Tell me!
... Oh.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm sure there isn't any money in there.
I'm not so sure...
(I guess there might be a clue or two...) ... The only thing in here is a letter.
(Hmm... There's no name or signature on this thing. It's handwritten in very precise, clear letters...) ... "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth..." Edgeworth!
How should I know!? I'm going to read the whole thing...!
(The rest of the letter goes on to describe the murder plot in detail! How to kill Robert Hammond, and frame Edgeworth... ...Calling Edgeworth out to the lake, getting on the boat... firing twice! This is exactly what I figured out today in court! It's all here... in perfect detail!) ...
I don't know... but it looks like these are instructions for that caretaker. When he killed Robert Hammond and called out Edgeworth, he was following instructions!
Look, I don't know, okay? But one thing's for certain. This letter is an amazing clue!
There's nothing left in the safe.
He left in a hurry, right? I don't think he even came back here after the trial.
You probably shouldn't just kidnap her. The police know about her anyway. I'm sure they'll do something.
(Great, now the bird's going to hate me.)
Yeah... I know.
What do you think we should do now, Maya?
Well? Had any good ideas?
(Something that happened back then has a hold on Edgeworth and it won't let go.)
Yeah?
You mean the nightmare?
A crime you committed?
Wait, Edgeworth! You... you mean...!
Edgeworth... See this letter?
This came out of the safe in the shack where that boat rental caretaker lives.
Could he be an innocent defendant you got declared guilty or something?
Last chance...? Wait, maybe... Maybe he's talking about the statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident!
This is bad...
I don't know... I don't think there is anything we can do. Like it or not. If there's someone else who knows a lot about the DL-6 Incident, maybe...
M-Mr. Grossberg!
What do you know about Edgeworth's father?
(That's no surprise...)
I don't believe it... So you're saying he falsified his "testimony"? That Edgeworth's dad lied to protect his son...?
...!
Oh no!
What do you mean?
What happened in the trial between Edgeworth's dad and von Karma?
A vacation...?
You have strange ideas about vacations, Maya.
(Odd... If he wanted to keep a perfect record so badly... why would he take such a long vacation?)
You bet it's good! (I can't believe the fiendish planning that went into this murder... And we almost fell right into his trap!)
(I think I'll stay out of this one...)
Huh? His own sake?
(Huh...?)
What is it?
Miles Edgeworth?
(Uh oh. He's angry.)
Maybe it was Yanni Yogi?
Uh... Yeah, I guess that would be what happened.
I think that's definitely a possibility, yes...
Oh, right...
Hmm... could it be Manfred von Karma?
Um, well, I'm not sure...
What does this mean, then? Why would von Karma want to frame Edgeworth...?
Huh? His own sake?
(Huh...?)
I won't let him!
I know that! ... I... I just believe in Edgeworth's innocence! I can't believe he'd kill someone!
I don't care! I know he's not guilty!
Mr. Grossberg... thank you!
I understand. (The police materials... hmm.)
Everyone must be out looking for the old guy... Yogi.
(von Karma's in the Records Room!)
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for a first date.
We were only here just yesterday. I'm sure they just haven't had time to clean... ...
Nothing. I was just noticing that he isn't here. von Karma...
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons others... are question marks. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Don't touch that. It's evidence...
Someone must have been looking in it recently.
Hmm... "Unsolved cases"?
Wh-what!?
(I can see how this guy was Edgeworth's mentor.)
This large drawer is half-open. The label on the drawer reads: "Unsolved Cases: Evidence." All the stuff in here looks like random junk. Only the evidence for the DL-6 Incident is missing. I can guess who took it, too. von Karma.
Mr. von Karma... You had an axe to grind with Mr. Gregory Edgeworth, didn't you?
Because he dealt a blow to your otherwise perfect trial record?
So you did... but what I don't get is... Why did you take his son under your wing afterwards? The son of your most bitter rival?
His guilt of 15 years ago, you mean?
(We were right... So von Karma is going to bring up DL-6 in court tomorrow.)
Mr. von Karma, have a look at this.
This was you, wasn't it? You instructed Yanni Yogi to commit murder.
Wh-what!?
A stun gun. For self defense... usually.
Six hundred thous...!?
(No!!!)
M-Maya!
Waaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Ugh... he got us. The letter's... gone, of course. And he took the DL-6 evidence... all of it. Back to having no clues. Wait... Maya jumped first. Maya...! Is she okay? ...) Ma...Maya!
Maya! Open your eyes!
Maya!
Huh!? Oh... yeah. A-are you okay!?
Maya! (Grr! There has to be some way I can help her! I'd better do something about her self-confidence, first.) ...? (Maya... She's holding something! What is that? A bullet?) "DL-6 Incident, Evidence No. 7 Taken from the heart of Gregory Edgeworth." I remember... von Karma was holding this when Maya jumped him.
(I'll prove it to you, Maya. You're most definitely not useless! I'll prove it to you in court tomorrow!)
No clues here.
(This is it... judgment day. Today, things are gong to get settled at last... a lot of things.) Waaaaaaaargh! Wh-what's the big idea!?
Yeah... thanks, Maya.
(Edgeworth is looking glum as always. I hope von Karma doesn't push him too hard.)
Maya... Maybe you should go outside and discharge?
(Try not to electrocute anyone on your way out...)
Detective Gumshoe!
How did it go, Detective?
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. You must be tired.
(Yogi says he's forgotten his own name... But that has to be a lie! Why would he want revenge on Edgeworth if he couldn't remember his past!? He does remember... and I'm going to prove it!)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)
(He has to know his name! Yanni Yogi! You're Yanni Yogi and I'm going to prove it!)
I'd call what you did "running away," and not "just leaving." You heard Larry's testimony, and realized you were in danger!
(He sure seems relaxed! In fact, they both do--von Karma and Yanni Yogi!)
Then why did you leave!?
(If I sat quietly, Edgeworth would be guilty in three minutes!)
Food...?
But you weren't arrested until this morning! Why didn't you go back to the caretaker's shack?
(Yeah, right! Nice try von Karma! No one's going to believe that!)
(Please! Your Honor, come to your senses!)
You've lost much of your memory, is that correct?
Then how could you know that you didn't have anything to do with this incident!
Or... Or maybe you're lying about not having your memory, hmm? You know exactly who you are!
(Grr... How am I supposed to prove what's going on in that old codger's head? That's impossible!)
How can you say you had no motive? I say you do! You had a grudge against Edgeworth and the victim, Robert Hammond! That's why you took revenge on them! Right?
(I have to prove he's lying about his memory... Otherwise, it's going to be the same thing over and over until the trial ends!)
(First things first, I have to prove this man is who he is! Do that and the motive will prove itself!)
Yes... Yes, Your Honor?
Of course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has "nothing to do with this case" and "no motive"... Both of these statements are lies!
Of course, Your Honor!
(Don't play dumb von Karma!)
His name... is "Gregory Edgeworth"! ...
(Wow... that's pretty harsh, Your Honor...)
His name... is "Robert Hammond"!
Uh...
That's true...
His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!
(I thought the judge would have heard of it... it was such a famous case.)
Your Honor! If this man is Mr. Yogi, then he has a clear motive!
...
(This is it... I have to do this now! If I can't prove he's Yogi right here, right now... Then I've got nowhere else to go!)
It's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's fingerprints! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...
Huh?
Wh-why?
What? What!? No fingerprints!?
Wh-what!? (Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)
(No...!)
Uh...
(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no... I can't let it end like this. I can't lose! There has to be another way!)
I didn't even consider that he might have erased his fingerprints... (What do I do!?)
(Yeah, yeah, very funny. You're a sore winner, von Karma. ... Wait a second... "Cross-examine the parrot"?)
Your Honor! The defense would like to take Mr. von Karma up on his proposal!
Exactly, Your Honor! I would like to cross-examine the witness's pet parrot!
Wait a second! You were the one who suggested I cross-examine the parrot, von Karma! I have a right to do as you suggested!
!
Let the parrot take the stand. I will cross-examine her, Your Honor.
(von Karma's rigged every person's testimony, every piece of evidence... Except the parrot! She's my last chance! At least... I think so.)
(You know, come to think of it... This is a really stupid idea.)
(Think! von Karma is a perfectionist in all things. He's probably rigged every piece of evidence and all the testimonies... If I can't do the unexpected I've no chance of winning!) Your Honor. I've thought about this proposal... And I'm going to do it. I'm going to cross-examine the parrot!
(It must be hurt... to be ignored by a bird.)
Right...
... I... I don't know! What do we do, Maya?
Witness! You can't just say "hello" and expect us to get anywhere! I want you to testify! Maya, you talk to her.
(Remember... two days ago...)
(If I can get Polly to say that here...! That will prove that the caretaker had something to do with DL-6!)
(This is ridiculous! Why won't she say it!?)
(Wait... Don't tell me von Karma expected this! He couldn't have retrained the parrot... could he!? Did he train her not to respond when we asked if we'd forgotten anything!?)
(Maybe I should get her to say her name?)
Uh, well, I guess it doesn't really have anything to do with that, no.
Yes it does!
Listen. We've not here to answer the question of "who is the caretaker." We're here to prove that he is Yanni Yogi! All we have to do is tie the name "Polly" to Yogi!
Your Honor. The proof that the parrot's name reveals the caretaker's identity is...
Leads to:
Judge:
(Uh oh... wrong again.)
It's on the "Case Summary" page!
It's on the "Victim Data" page!
It's on the "Suspect Data" page!
This page has all the information about Yanni Yogi! Right after he was arrested, his fiancee committed suicide, see?
What was his fiancee's name?
Exactly, Your Honor! He remembered the name of his fiancee who committed suicide. That's why he named his parrot after her!
(Where am I going to find that!?)
(Right... but what?)
(Maybe I'll get her to say the number of that safe...)
Let's just try to get her to say anything, okay?
Uh, well, I guess it doesn't really have anything to do with that, no.
Actually it does! That's why I had her say it!
Leads to:
Judge:
(Uh oh... I think that was the wrong thing to show them.)
It's on the "Victim Data" page!
It's on the "Suspect Data" page!
It's on the "Case Summary" page!
Specifically, the date on which the DL-6 Incident occurred!
And the number on that safe is 1228!
He used the date of the DL-6 Incident as the number for his safe, Your Honor! That's how important that date was to him!
(Where am I going to find that!?)
(Right... but what?)
Witness, you're here to speak! You must speak to me!
...!
This is the real Yogi, I think. Finally. He's been acting feeble to hide his true identity. Acting... for 15 years!
...
(I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)
(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?
(Uh oh! What do I do?)
The judgment has already been passed! I object to Edgeworth's outburst...
(That would be Larry...)
(No... I'm sure Edgeworth thought about this one long and hard. This isn't my place to interfere!)
There's nothing we can do about it. This is his problem, now.
Huh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.
Huh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is innocent.
I'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your "nightmare."
It's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this Court Record. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me.
No, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)
(When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)
Yes, Your Honor.
What was the trial your father was involved in on that day?
(That was when Edgeworth pointed out the problem in von Karma's evidence...)
So, there were three people including yourself trapped in that elevator?
What did you do then?
What was it?
Did you know it was a pistol when you threw it?
The gun fired once?
The scream...
Are you sure you only heard one gunshot?
But that doesn't make sense! Look at this file one more time. This plainly contradicts the witness's testimony.
W-wait! There is a contradiction in the file!
W-wait! There is a contradiction in the file!
Look at the "Victim Data" in this file! It says quite plainly: "the murder weapon was fired twice"! Miles Edgeworth only heard one gunshot! Yet, the murder weapon was fired twice! The first shot was the accidental firing when the pistol was thrown. So... who fired the remaining shot!?
(What...!)
(Grr... I didn't think of that.) I, uh, don't have proof.
The Court Record...?
Wh-whoa! (She's right! That is strange!)
Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.
Leads to:
Judge:
Hah hah... Uh, I mean, I really don't mean any harm by it, Your Honor.
Look at this photograph.
This proves the murder weapon was fired twice, at the time of the incident! This photo proves it!
(Y-Your Honor, please... Please get a clue! Show the judge the contradiction in the photo!)
Leads to:
It's here... I think.
(Er... Maybe I need to be more specific here.)
Well, I think... it's here!
Yes?
R-right, Your Honor.
As should be obvious, the contradiction is here.
Your Honor! Gregory Edgeworth was killed by a shot from the pistol! Yet, there is also a bullet hole in the elevator door! We also know that the murder weapon was fired twice! Thus... Someone other than Edgeworth fired that second shot!
So, there was only one gunshot?
It must have been scary.
Take a look at this. This is a photograph of the scene of the crime, fifteen years ago. And in it, lies a clear contradiction to Mr. Edgeworth's testimony.
(Just as I thought, the judge is clueless... as always. Show the judge the contradiction in the photo!)
Leads to:
It's here... I think.
(Er... Maybe I need to be more specific here.)
Well, I think... it's here!
Yes?
R-right, Your Honor.
As should be obvious, the contradiction is here.
Your Honor! Miles Edgeworth testifies that there was only one gunshot! However, according to this photograph, not one, but two shots were fired! One shot hit the victim, the other hit the elevator door. I ask you, then! Why did Miles Edgeworth only hear one gunshot?
Urk...
(Grr... I didn't think of that.) I, uh, don't have proof.
The Court Record...?
Wh-whoa! (She's right! That is strange!)
Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.
Your Honor... The answer is in this file.
Look at the "Victim Data" in this file! It says quite plainly: "the murder weapon was fired twice"! Miles Edgeworth only heard one gunshot! Yet, the murder weapon was fired twice!
Leads to:
Hah hah... Uh, I mean, I really don't mean any harm by it, Your Honor.
"To this day"...?
(There it is! One part of the testimony that clearly contradicts the evidence... But I don't know what it means...! I'd better find out, and quick...)
It's simple, Your Honor. At the time of the incident, two shots were fired. One went into Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other hit the elevator door. Remember that the defendant lost consciousness after the shot he fired rang out. In conclusion... We must agree that the second shot was fired by someone else!
The murderer, of course!
(The "Case Summary"... that's on page 1.)
...!
(Gah! How did this happen!? I don't believe that the second bullet didn't exist! Was I wrong? Have I been wrong about this whole incident?)
... I'm sorry, Maya.
I... It looks like I was wrong.
If the second bullet wasn't there, then all my conjectures are for nothing!
... I'm sorry... It's just, when I saw the photograph, I thought that two shots had been fired. I was so certain of it. I thought I'd won! I thought there was another person, someone else who fired the killing shot. But now... I was wrong to think it could be that simple. This case has stood unsolved for fifteen years!
(I've been here before... It's just like my first day in court... There are so many things I know I should be saying... But my mind's gone blank, I can't find the words...)
(Every lead I thought I had has been squashed. This is really the end. Edgeworth... I'm sorry.)
!!!
H-huh...? Maya...?
(What's happening to me...? I have to think...! Wait... don't think... act!)
Leads to:
Leads to:
Your Honor! I... I object!
Oof!
(I... I don't know! His case is perfect!)
Grah!
!!!
Wh-what? What did you just say?
(The second bullet must exist? But where!?)
Wait, Your Honor!
I, uh... Th-the second bullet! It, uh, it exists!
I-I realize that, Your Honor. (I'm really grasping here!) I-it's just, someone took it from the scene of the crime! That's what happened!
Th-th-the murderer!
I'm... still thinking about that one.
Huh?
O-of course there was a need. That's why he took it!
W-well... The reason the murderer took the bullet away from the scene with him is...!
Er... Maybe he thought that the bullet would be used as proof?
It was a special bullet, so he took it with him...
Uh... Well, the murderer was a very cautious sort, you see. That's why the murderer had to search for that bullet...
Huh?
Oh, right.
(Argh... This isn't going so well.)
(Why would the murderer have spent the time to look for that stray bullet...? I haven't got a clue!)
Uh... Um...
Urk...
(Had to take it...? The murderer? What does that mean?)
Y-yes, Your Honor! (I have no idea what I'm doing...) U-uh, well, the murderer had no intention of taking the bullet from the scene. But... uh, the murderer HAD to take that bullet.
Well, for instance... (For instance WHAT!?) Uh, maybe the bullet, uh... hit the murderer?
J-just saying, for instance. I mean, if it hit you, you would have to take it with you, wouldn't you? It's not like you could perform surgery right there. Y-y'know?
(Wait a second... I was just talking off the top of my head, but what if that's really what happened?)
Uh, yes... I guess that's how it would work, yes.
The murderer came from outside, yes.
(No one was wounded at the time of the incident... He's right. I can't think of anyone...)
Huh?
Crazy?
But took it because he was injured!
It could only mean one thing!
He was the man who shot Gregory Edgeworth!
(Oh man!)
Uh, n-no, Your Honor.
(Uh oh. Should I come out and say it now!?)
(Wait... I don't have enough proof yet. This is my trump card, I'd better save it for the right time.)
I-I'm fine, Your Honor.
Wh-what! Not yet!
A-alright! I may not know what I'm doing... but here goes!
Your Honor! There is a suspect... one lone suspect!
V-V-V... (Urk! My h-hands are shaking!)
von Karma!
Because you took a vacation for several months starting the day after the incident! Yet you pride yourself on a perfect record! Why would you take such a long vacation without any reason!?
Urk...
E-Edgeworth!?
(Grr... Nobody's that perfect!)
No... he couldn't have. You can't just pull bullets out of yourself! ... (Wait... What does that mean...? That bullet has to be somewhere! But... where?)
(It would be impossible to find the doctor who operated on von Karma now... Even if von Karma did undergo surgery!)
(Urk!)
(The Court Record...? What could be in there!? Gah! There's no time! I'd better think on it as I go...)
Alright, von Karma. I'll prove it. And I'll even use evidence... I know how you like it so much.
The evidence that proves von Karma was shot is...!
Leads to:
Karma:
Er... Sorry.
(I'm really not sure how I've managed to make it this far...)
Y-yes, Your Honor.
von Karma is perfect... He wouldn't risk surgery, leaving an evidence trail. So then, I ask, where is that bullet now? I think it unlikely that von Karma performed surgery on himself!
I do. There is the possibility that the bullet is still inside von Karma!
Well, there's one way to find out. We could use this metal detector! Well, von Karma? I'm going to run this over you, and see what we find.
Your Honor! The defense requests that we be allowed to use the metal detector!
The statute of limitations runs out on this case today! It was you who said we had to end it right here, right now!
I don't know... but we have to give it a shot!
(It reacted! Something's inside his right shoulder! The bullet!)
... Mr. von Karma...?
...?
What!?
(That's because you took it out of the Records Room yesterday!)
No... I'm the one who's sorry, Mr. von Karma.
You were close... one day away from freedom. You see... I have proof!
Who would have thought you would have dug your own grave trying to convict Edgeworth! I can link that bullet in your shoulder to the DL-6 Incident... And here's my final proof!
Leads to:
Maya:
Huh? You mean, that was the wrong evidence? Everyone looks kinda puzzled...
(Uh oh, he's really mad.)
R-right! You got lucky, von Karma, but this next one is the real evidence, okay!?
This is the bullet used in the DL-6 Incident. This was taken from the heart of the victim, Mr. Gregory Edgeworth. The bullet is preserved quite nicely, with all the ballistic markings intact.
You may recall the term. It came up in the first trial, two days ago.
We have two bullets in our possession. One, the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other, Mr. von Karma, is the bullet buried in your shoulder. We could analyze both bullets... Then, if the markings matched... We would know that both bullets had been fired from the same gun! The very same pistol... in other words, the murder weapon that killed Gregory Edgeworth!
Mr. von Karma? You will let us remove the bullet from your shoulder. Then we'll compare the ballistic markings to those on this bullet... And solve this case once and for all! Well, Mr. von Karma!?
Heh... It was pretty close, though. I was sure we'd had it.
So, it's finally over, Edgeworth.
Yeah?
Y-you're welcome.
(Dear, dear...)
(It's been fifteen years since I've seen Edgeworth this... unguarded.)
Thank you!
Speaking of which, what are you doing now, Lotta?
Really? That's too bad.
?
Huh?
Wh-why the sad face, Larry!? What happened now!?
Uh... you don't look sick...
(Larry, Larry...)
Uh, I think you'll be fine, Larry.
Yeah? What's up?
Well, yeah. That's not that strange. People give money away to celebrate sometimes.
Huh. What a weird amount. I mean, it's not a little, but it's not a lot either. ... $38.00 exactly?
$38...! No... No!!! Larry, it was you!!!
Huh?
What?
... Edgeworth... you didn't know, did you?
Yeah... too well.
I know, I know.
Edgeworth...
You should have told me!
Grr... Where does that leave me!? I became a defense attorney because of what you two did!
D-death! The death sentence for both of you! Man, if only I had known, I'd have become a prosecutor!
Edgeworth...
Detective Gumshoe took us out on the town that night. We celebrated Edgeworth's new found freedom. Although, Edgeworth was still in detention.
Whoa... I went a little overboard yesterday. My head hurts... Huh? It's still only 5:00. Maybe I should go back to sleep... Hmm? (What's this? A letter?)
(G-goodbye!?) What time is it? Gah! The first trains for the mountains have already left! To the station!
... I guess I'm too late... ...
Maya!
...
So... you're leaving?
W-wait!
... I never could have saved Edgeworth without your help.
On the last day of the trial... I heard her. I heard Mia's voice!
Yes... only her voice, but still... It was at the very end when I thought we'd lost everything.
But you were the one who stopped von Karma, Maya!
Sorry, but I have evidence that you helped!
(Show Maya some evidence to cheer her up!)
Maya:
von Karma was convinced he had taken all of the evidence pertaining to DL-6! But you were the one who rescued the last piece of evidence we needed! This was the bullet that put an end to von Karma! And you were the one who gave it to me!
Thanks, Maya. I couldn't have done it without you.
Huh?
... Okay. I'll be waiting. ...
Uh, I don't know about that...
Maya:
(Uh oh! Now that I think about it I don't understand this evidence either!)
Bye.
Er... yes, Your Honor. (Uh oh... I got a bad feeling about this...)
Gumshoe:

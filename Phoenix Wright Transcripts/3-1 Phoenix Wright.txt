*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!
I, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*
Actually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...
Nnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*
Oh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.
Oh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.
But! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*
Right away, Your Honor!
Um, I... I admit I was there...
Right! Like I said, I'm not a killer!
Um, I... I admit I was there...
Y-Yeah, sort of. The place where SOMETHING happened anyway.
*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*
It was just a coincidence! We bumped into each other by accident.
But I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!
Huh!? Um... *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough*
*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*
W-Well, it's true that I was pretty shocked when I found the body. But, but I...
I hardly knew the guy to begin with...
Right! Um, well, no... That is... I mean...
*achoo* *achoo* *achoo*
Err... Umm, well... I guess I did know his name.
Um... I heard he used to date Dollie.
But that's all I knew about him!
I never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!
Th-That's right! I mean why would I even--
...
... *achoo*
Ah! No! It wasn't me! I'm not a killer, I swear!
Y-Yes, well...
Um, well, you see...
He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.
Y-Yes, that's right! I saw it at the crime scene! That's why... That's why I figured he must love British stuff, see? It's true! Cross my heart! I swear I didn't do it...
Y-Yeah, I'm sure. It was right there on his back.
Hey! Wait a minute! He's wearing a leather jacket! The Union Jack was on the back of the t-shirt he was wearing...
... P-P-P-Please forgive me! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
Uggghhh...
I, err, umm... Yeah, I took some but...
Yeah, that's right! It kills colds good! Hey, wait a second... How did you know I'm a big fan of Coldkiller X...?
Well... Actually, I seem to have lost it somewhere...
Huh...?
Uggghhh...
The truth is... I went because he called me.
*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! I was afraid you wouldn't believe the truth!
The truth is... I went because he called me.
No! Never! ... But... That day, he called me up and told me he wanted to talk about Dollie.
My um... It's kind of embarrassing. She's my, umm, sweetheart...
He was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...
Yeah. And we were both there right on time.
Yeah, he was studying how to manufacture and improve pharmaceuticals. Everyone called him the "Alchemist of Ivy U".
I gotta admit it was a little suspicious. He had a whole laboratory and everything! It was filled with chemicals and strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.
Yeah, pretty sure. That's the time class ends. But they're always doing experiments, so it doesn't matter much.
Yeah. Those pharmacology guys are always in the lab whipping up something.
Well OK, sure. I don't know all that much though.
That's right. And they sure look dangerous. They use non-standard voltages, so there are high-voltage cables everywhere.
Yeah, there were electrical poles set up all around the building. The high-voltage cables run overhead around the roof.
We talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.
You know... *achoo* *cough* That maybe we should hang out again sometime.
Then later when I went back, I found him lying there.
Umm, yeah. That's when I found the body.
Well, th-that's right, I was. ...
... Umm... I thought maybe we could make up.
... *achoo* *achoo*
I'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...
Yeah, I always get a little careless when the weather starts to warm up. I guess I shouldn't sleep with the window open this early in spring, huh?
Well, I always took one after meals... So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.
But I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.
Huh? What does that have to do with anything?
I always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh.
Wh-What do you mean!?
... *achoo*
... *achoo*
... *achoo*
...!
B-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...
M-Miss Fey...
...!
*cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!
I... I'll tell you what really happened!
*cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!
Y-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!
P-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!
That guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...
B-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!
That guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...
He said all sorts of terrible things about Dollie! He said that she was a bad girl!
Yup!
Anyway... After he said that, I just, I just...
I lost my temper and gave him a shove!
That guy... He just said what he wanted to say to me... And then he put on the jacket he was holding and started to leave. That's when... That's when I lost my temper and flew into a furious frenzy! I just gave him a... light, gentle shove to the chest.
Right! There was nothing like that at all!
... Well, I guess it's possible.
At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...
I'm not sure... But it was really loud! It was like, "SNAP!"... You know, come to think of it, I wonder what that was...
Umm, how do I put it... It was like a sharp crack. Aha! Could it... Could it have been...?
When I pushed him, he dropped the umbrella he was holding. He fell right on top of it, and it broke. That was probably the noise I heard.
Yeah, it was a plastic umbrella. Cheap and frail, kind of like the owner! Then again, I wish I had any kind of umbrella. I was totally soaked to the bone.
Umm... Is it OK if I go on?
After I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.
Yeah. It was right there under him. Actually, if it hadn't been under him, I was planning on borrowing it for myself.
Well yeah, you see I was wearing this sweater here... Dollie stayed up late for nights at a time knitting it for me... I didn't want the rain to dampen the handmade symbol of her love...
A little while after I left, I started to get worried.
Yes, I did! I admit it! I-I was furious!
Well, um, yeah... But like I said, I got worried about him later.
So I went back. But h-he was just laying there, d-dead!
*cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough* *cough* Um, nope. Nobody...
Come on... If I had mentioned that...
Miss Fey... I-I'm sorry about what happened back there... I... I...
Yeah... So I guess I can start to relax then, huh?
B-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!
Huh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the love of my life, that's why!
Sure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was fate that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!
She gave this to me the day we met as a symbol of our love! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, "I want you to carry this."
This darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!
It makes me so happy, I show it to everyone I meet! I want to share my happiness with the whole world!
Yeah, but she's so shy. Every time I see her, she always says the same thing to me. "Please give it back now."
Huh...? Y-Yeah, it was... But how did you...?
What's this? A newspaper clipping? Let's see... "Murder in the Courthouse?" M-Murder?
Your Honor! P-Please, I have something I want to say! *achoo*
Please... Please strike everything the defense said just now from the record!
You're totally wrong, Miss Fey! Dollie... She... She couldn't do something like that!
Aaaarrgghh... *achoo* *achoo* Leave my Dollie alone! *achoo* *cough*
We're so lovey-wuvey we literally make people sick! It's just jealousy, I think...
Don't worry, Dollie! I'll protect you!
What are you SAYING, Miss Fey!? Toilet!? My perfect little Dollie doesn't poop!
On behalf of Dollie, I object!
I-I won't let you bully her like this...!
Why? B-Because...! Because I'm madly in love with her!
W-Well... I guess she must be madly in love with me too...
See? Just like I told you!
What...!? To k-keep me quiet!? ... Um... Keep me quiet about what...?
That's because there is no secret, I tell you.
My n-necklace...?
Yeah, but she's so shy. Every time I see her, she always says the same thing to me. "Please give it back now."
Y-You're lying!
...I don't...... I don't believe you... NOOO!! Th-That's a LIE!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
I-I'm sorry...
F-Forgive me... I... I... I'm sorry...
... I ate it.
It was too big to swallow, so I had to chew it into little bits first, but yeah... ...Ugh. Aaaaaaaaahhhh!
...!
Mia:
I'm sorry, Miss Fey. It totally slipped my mind. I'm really, really sorry... I know you believed in me, and I feel like I really let you down.
Um... There's something I forgot to tell you.
That day... The day I met Doug Swallow...
P-Poison...?
Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!
There's one more thing... After I pushed him that day... I got worried and came back to have a look. And she was there... Dollie was right there. She was crouched down next to him...
She told me not to ever tell anyone about it, but... I'm sorry, Dollie!
Miss Fey! You tell them! D-Dollie didn't do it... Sh-She's innocent!
Miss Fey...
... M-M-M-M-M-M-Meeee!?
N-No... It-It can't be...
... Th-Th-Th... That can't be trueeeeeeeee!!
But I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.
I always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us.
It-It can't be true... My... Dear... Dollie... *achoo*
...
Th-Thanks... Um, you know... I was thinking...
The Dollie that I saw up there on the witness stand... I don't think that was really her.
Yeah... The Dollie I know could NEVER have said those kinds of terrible things... Maybe... Maybe she was like... I don't know... A fake or something.
Yeah, you're right... That's probably for the best.
B-But... Out of all my friends, everyone says I'm the most grown up!
... Right now I... I'm studying to become a lawyer myself.
Well, yeah... I guess I am... But there's a friend that I desperately want to help! And if I hurry, then I should still be able to save him in time!
Say, Miss Fey? A lawyer is someone who can help people when they're in trouble, right?
OK... I'm going to do it. I'll study my butt off. I'll become a lawyer for sure! I hope... I hope we see each other again some day, maybe even in court.
It's been five years since I was acquitted of all charges. I became a lawyer like I planned, and managed to save my friend. But Mia has passed on to a better place. For me, this trial brings up a lot of painful memories. But... it also brings up some very precious ones. And memories that I thought would never rise to the surface again... Mia is gone now. But even so... I can hear her in my mind.
...Five long years... Something has happened that's made me think back to her words of wisdom... But that is a story for another day...

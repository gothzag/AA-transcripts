Yeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.
That's right. But I do like "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre".
(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.
A press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?
Confessing...? Sounds pretty serious.
(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)
There's a grand set of doors over there.
This sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything "fancy" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)
One of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.
I had no idea who most of them were.
Ah, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...
The awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.
(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)
You're such a glutton, Maya.
(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)
Thank you very much for inviting us today.
Ah, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)
I can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.
The Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, "The Nickel Samurai". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids too.
(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)
...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?
So who is this "Jammin' Ninja" again?
(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)
A ninja... Who becomes a star??
(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.
(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)
Maybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.
(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)
(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)
Wow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...
I can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.
Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Juan Corrida's Room". "Juan Corrida"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.
There are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...
"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, "To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients".
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Matt Engarde's Room". "Matt Engarde"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...
Thank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.
You mean the press conference?
Yesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)
Hmm... Nice manager.
Hmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.
They're using a compact stage, I see.
(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)
Oww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!
P-Police? Did they just say the police?
Um, wait, I'll come with you...
I-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?
Um... What are you doing here?
You STILL feel like eating?
(Don't pull the "since we're here" trick on me...)
Oh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.
I'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.
(I guess something big must have happened...)
It's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.
It looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.
But we're all out of film...
Hey, hey! You can't just go and "borrow" an expensive professional camera like that!
Ms. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?
Y-Yeah...
Um... I plead the fifth.
M-Me!?
Um, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?
"Pros"? Pros at doing what?
Wh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...
N-No way. The police told us not go anywhere, remember?
(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)
O-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.
(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)
There's nothing really out of the ordinary here...
Doesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.
Yeah, OK.
There's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.
Yup.
Well, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.
They haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...
The awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.
(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.
Yeah.
That's right, a "kiwi".
(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)
A lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...
These cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.
Seats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.
Ms. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?
Y-Yeah...
Um... I plead the fifth.
M-Me!?
(She's not talking about Edgeworth, is she...?)
I'm sorry, but what in the world just happened?
Um, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?
(That southern accent can only mean...)
H-Hey... Lotta...
Ah... Detective Gumshoe...
So... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?
Huh? Why do you ask?
What?
The Jammin' Ninja...
You mean Lotta?
That time?
Oh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.
"Hanging around"...?
B-But why would she...?
(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)
So the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?
(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)
(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)
...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?
"Can't have that happen"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)
Wh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?
(Looks like yet another "Steel Samurai" hero is in hot water...)
Yeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...
...That's a good way to improve yourself.
Oh? Then who's number one...?
A-Ah... So who's number two?
(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)
It's only wishful thinking.
(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)
You can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.
(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)
Maya's a big fan of his.
Would you take a look at this for me?
Do you know this person?
It looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.
It looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.
Nope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.
...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.
(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)
...For me...? But why?
(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)
(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)
Mr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?
The Nickel Samurai's...?
So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?
And that's when he told you to give this to me...?
(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)
She got a phone call.
(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)
(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)
...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?
Ah, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.
(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)
Ack!
Huh? I... I'm not sure... (Did this transceiver just...?)
Y-Yes, hello? Wright here...
And you are...!?
Maya...?
(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?
(Th-This... No! This can't be!)
..."Kidnapping for ransom"...
(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)
H-How much!? How much do you want!?
Hurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya --
...What?
Complete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?
What...?
Juan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...
M-Matt Engarde? But why?
H-However!? However what!?
... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)
Maya!
O-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?
Aagh!
D-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?
...
...She's been kidnapped.
It's not your fault, Pearls.
(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)
(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!
Shhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.
But the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...
(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)
Huh?
Umm...
There's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being "set-up"...?)
...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)
You're right...
Ah, morning Pearls.
We have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...
(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)
Yeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.
(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)
...No matter where I look in this familiar space I call my office... No, I can't let my mind wander now! I don't have the time! I've got to get going on this case!
Huh?
Yeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.
...
Pearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.
Pearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?
What do you mean...?
(...Her family...)
I'm sorry...
...
Pearls...?
(She looks out of it... Maybe I should leave her alone...)
(We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)
G-Good morning. How are you today?
I know this situation might be a little tough for you...
Um... We're...
...?
E-Excuse me...?
... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!
...?
... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.
(I think "strange" is an understatement.)
Huh!?
(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)
Smile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.
Sorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.
(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)
(Does he have a mind of his own!?)
Mr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...
No no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...
(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)
It's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.
Mr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.
...Huh?
(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)
It's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?
Yes. While you were in-costume no less.
(He didn't know...? That's odd...)
I don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...
I got it as a "present" from someone.
I've also been instructed to take your case.
Yes.
(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)
That's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?
(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)
You killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?
If that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?
(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)
(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)
Uh... Um, yeah...
Uh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.)
(That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!)
Um, "dude", you know what...? Forget I asked...
Please, wait! ...I really need to take your case!
If you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!
"De Killer"...
(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)
Huh?
Uh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)
Well, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.
(True enough... "The Nickel Samurai" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)
(Everyone loves a good scandal...)
Can you tell me about your activities last night?
And you were alone the entire time?
Because of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?
(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)
Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?
(With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.)
About you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...
The Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?
Um... Do you know why you were arrested?
Did they find something on you?
A button...?
(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)
... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)
Yeah?
W-We can do that...?
(Maya's Magatama!)
(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.
Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?
Please put the phone away and answer this question yourself.
...
Nothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.
(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)
Well, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...
Well, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?
Ah, it's OK... I already did that...
(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)
Y-Yeah, that's right.
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
I-It's OK, Pearls. Really.
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
Since there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.
Hey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.
Why are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--
(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)
(Ow! She slapped me!!)
I guess?
(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)
I'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.
I think your hair now suits you perfectly.
*fidget, fidget*
Yeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit "off", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)
(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by "old man"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?
(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)
Ah, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...
Um, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...
(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)
I wanted to ask you about it.
(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.
U-Uh... Um...
Um, you know... That's not entirely...
Um... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...
Ms. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?
It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...
(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)
...I don't know what to say...
Umm...
But I haven't said anything...
Huh? What woman?
...Pearls? Are you thirsty?
OK. I'll go get you some juice or something.
(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)
I want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...
Getting ready? For what...?
(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)
Ah, I see...
?
Th-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?
Please tell me! What did you see!?
(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)
Please tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?
(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)
(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)
...Um... No, that's okay... Really.
I know, I know...
Looks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.
...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.
There's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...
The chandelier?
The awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.
(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.
Yes.
(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)
Lotta...
Wh-Wh-What!?
Wh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?
Y-Your camera...?
Yep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.
I can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?
(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)
Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...
(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Juan Corrida's Room".
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Matt Engarde's Room".
That's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)
So you lost your camera...?
Lotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?
(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)
Lotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder.
What were you doing here...?
A big scoop...?
(I wonder what "scoop" she was after this time...?)
Lotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?
What kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?
(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)
(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your "I rule!" smile...)
You were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?
Yeah... I guess so.
P-Please don't direct your anger at me...
(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)
Please don't look straight at me while you're saying that...
(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)
(Like you're one to talk...)
Wh-Wh-What!? But why!?
Lotta, that was very insensitive of you!
(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)
W-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!
(A "little" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)
Um... Do you know anything...
We're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.
Um, uh... We're...
Um... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?
Well, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.
A-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)
It's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.
That's the bedroom over there.
There's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.
(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)
Looks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.
Looks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?
There's a giant bone sitting on the plate.
(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)
Y-Yes, that is correct.
"Dinner"? What did you eat?
(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)
And after the show ended, you came back to this room...?
Oh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)
And that's when you found his body, isn't it?
(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)
Um, so... About you and...
S-Sorry...
(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)
His manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?
He didn't?
I see...
Pearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?
Do you have any ideas?
As to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?
I'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?
M-Ms. Andrews...?
Yes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.
You know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...
(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)
(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)
You were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?
(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)
(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)
(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)
Did you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?
! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)
(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)
S-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)
Um, I'd like to ask you about this...
(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)
We're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.
The victim... Which makes this the crime scene too.
Not yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.
(I just want Maya to be alright...)
Can you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?
Thank you.
That's great, Pearls!
There are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...
Empty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.
Maybe red was his favorite color...?
(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)
Yeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.
... (I don't think I want to "bear" with the trauma the last case caused me...)
(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)
OK. That over there is a "watch". You wear it on your wrist.
(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)
It's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...
It looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.
(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)
Yup. It's big, but it's a bed.
(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)
Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.
A flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.
This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.
Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show?
(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on top of the lid...
It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.
There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.
...What seems weird?
... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)
Do you know what was the cause of death?
The scene of the crime...?
There's a knife in his chest.
(So he was stabbed to death...)
There were fingerprints on the knife?
(That's bad... Real bad...)
Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?
Yeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.
(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his "hakama"...)
What!?
A witness!? Wh-Who is it!?
(Please... Anyone but her!)
Something that was a little off...? As in...?
(It uses radio waves, huh?)
What can you tell me about this guitar case?
The guitar case?
(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)
So about this wine glass...
You noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?
Yeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?
You can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.
(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)
...For what?
(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)
...Because I'm in the number one spot?
Huh? Really? Then who's in first...?
O-Oh...
(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)
One dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?
(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)
Yeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.
... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...
Yeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.
(I feel sort of bad for him...)
What do you know about this?
(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)
(Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...)
(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)
(Owww!)
(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)
... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?
...
(Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!? What is this...?)
It's called an "autograph".
It's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.
Ah, it's a special way of writing called "cursive".
Look here. See how it says, "To my dearest Wendy" in more normal letters here?
(Hold on...)
Wendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...
Ah, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?
Can you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?
I see...
I see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?
Oh... I guess the "Y" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?
Sounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.
(I can't believe she's really considering it!)
So what's the "Jammin' Ninja" TV show like?
...Uh, what?
A... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?
Aww, that's too bad for him...
(I can't believe she's really considering it!)
Would you mind telling me about this "gossip"?
Yeah.
O-Oh really... You too, huh...?
(Looks like a tabloid Ms. Oldbag would read...) Alright, let's see here... "Jammin' Midnight Rendezvous!?"
What...?
... Adrian Andrews...?
(But... It seems kind of odd. That woman, Ms. Andrews... Together with the biggest rival of her client...?)
(Pearls is just following along, not having any idea as to why he's smiling...)
(Old man, huh...)
I'm guessing you've seen this case before?
(The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.)
(That does seem a little strange...)
Yeah...
Thanks.
Yeah, I would love to go back in time and relive a few of those good things... *chuckle*
(Yeah, I guess not...)
(Hmm... So Mr. Powers likes this type of woman...) What do you know about Ms. Andrews...?
(He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...)
What do you think about this article...?
And that's it?
Uh, yeah.
(...You're such a mama's boy...)
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Then, please! Tell us what you saw!
(Um... Doesn't that imply you aren't a good person...?) Alright, I'll give you what you want...
Leads to:
Oldbag:
W-Well, yes... but...
B-But why!?
Yes, it is.
Um...
(Well, it may say "Wendy"... But somehow, I don't think Juan had THIS "Wendy" in mind when he signed it...)
Uh, un. I can't let you have it, just like that.
(Wow, she must really want this autograph...)
Huh...?
You're kidding!
And...? Did you tell that to the police?
(What did Mr. Engarde ever do to her to deserve this...?)
What did Mr. Engarde do to you to make you so...
Wh-What is it?
Oh... Um, I'll tell you about that after we get home, OK?
Ack! Um, how about we just listen to what Ms. Oldbag has to say for now, OK Pearls? So, Ms. Oldbag. Who is this "woman" you're talking about...?
His own manager? But why...?
(Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag?
And do you have proof that Mr. Engarde did what you say he did...?
(Ugh... Of course. A tabloid...)
(Why would Ms. Oldbag have information like that...? And where did she get it...?)
(Great, now even Pearls is calling him "Scruffy"... Thanks Franziska.) They said something about an investigation briefing earlier, right? Why don't we come back and try again later when they're done...
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Lotta, will you please answer my questions? On the night of the murder, why were you loitering around the victim's room?
What I want to know about are the details of this "scoop".
Alright then. An unpleasant tabloid photographer looking for a scoop... I'm going to say that you were looking into a scandal.
Could it be that you, Lotta Hart, were looking for a break with a huge story? Perhaps an unfolding scandal between Juan Corrida and this person...?
Leads to:
Lotta:
Um...
O-Oh, really...?
(If you're such a pro, why don't you do your own research and figure it out!) Um, let's try that again, shall we...?
She's Adrian Andrews, Matt Engarde's manager.
The Nickel Samurai's manager, caught secretly meeting with his rival, the Jammin' Ninja. It would be the hottest story of the season, wouldn't it?
Backup...?
...Um, you mean, "news source"...?
Leads to:
Lotta:
Huh?
Well, if the pro we're talking about is you, then this looks right up your alley...
(Looks like I touched a nerve there...)
This is the article from a certain weekly tabloid. "Jammin' Midnight Rendezvous!?" "...to the mysterious, yet beautiful manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!"
Mr. Corrida didn't have a manager of his own. What's more, his rival, Mr. Engarde's manager... Adrian Andrews... She has the initials A. A.! You saw this article and then thought to take some pictures of them as proof. That's why you were lurking around Mr. Corrida's door last night!
You were looking into Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' affair, weren't you?
But there's already an article about it in one of the weekly tabloid magazines... It's no longer breaking news.
(Wow, Lotta, nice journalistic integrity you got there...)
?
Y-Yeah, I understand...
You really want that note back, huh...? (I've got no idea why though. The story on that note is probably a bold faced lie...)
...Sorry, I zoned out.
Detective Gumshoe said they had an investigation briefing...
Why the blunt greeting?
What do you mean by that?
But... But... We can't just roll over and die! We have to stay positive!
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for arrests.
So what do you mean the evidence is airtight...?
Hmm... That's the button that you found during your body search of Mr. Engarde...
Um... Uh... And the second one is...?
... (Tomorrow's trial... Talk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place...)
So what about this "airtight testimony"...?
I thought so...
Um, well...
(Her blab knob is stuck on ten, and there's no turning it down... Trust me.)
What can you tell me about this guitar case...?
(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)
Tomato juice...
...It was his favorite drink? (First time I've heard that...)
The scandal with Mr. Corrida? But why?
The victim's manager...?
(A woman who was both Mr. Corrida's manager and Ms. Andrews' mentor... Could her suicide have something to do with this case...?)
And what is that?
(Gossip, huh... I wonder if he knows anything about that article...)
That voice... E-Edgeworth!!
...
...?
Wh-What do you mean "how much"...?
A-Ah, no, I would never...
(You're in DETENTION! Who in the world are you going to eat with!? The security guard!?)
This Celeste Inpax lady... Somehow, I get the feeling she is a very important person in all this...
That's not good. I still have a few questions I want to ask her...
...Well, we don't have much of a choice. I guess we'll have to come back later.
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for when a fellow officer is injured.
I thought you, the Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, had gone and died!
I... I never wanted to see you again!
Are you going to run tomorrow's trial...?
...
(What is that supposed to mean...?)
"The truth"...?
(Just what is going on inside his head...?)
...One year ago, you could not establish guilt in a few cases... Are those losses the reason you suddenly disappeared from the Prosecutor's Office? Did you leave because you had lost your "perfect win record"...?
To think your motivation for prosecuting trials was so selfish... It'd been better for everyone if you never came back from the dead, Edgeworth!
Well, if it was Franziska, she would almost definitely say,
But... The courtroom is not a personal battlefield for prosecutors and lawyers. I stand in the courtroom to defend my client. ...To save their lives.
Those who think only of their own ego-driven goals... Those kind of prosecutors are reprehensible to me. Even if you're a "prodigy"... Or someone like you, Edgeworth...
"A lot I have yet to learn"? Me...?
The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note?
But who would hide such a thing...?
Th-The victim...?
(Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?)
(Part one...?)
So, how are "Adrian Andrews" and "co-dependency" related?
And...?
Lost her will...? But why would she...?
Wh-Why would that...?
...! And that's... That's her "co-dependency"...?
Then... That means her super-confident attitude...
(How terrible...)
...Two parts?
(The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's "Adrian Andrews"!
She... She tried to kill herself...? She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try and kill herself...
("Co-dependency"... The word most unsuited to describing that woman...)
Ms. Andrews...
(To think that behind that unwavering, brave front... She's been hiding this weakness in fear...)
You mean the one about Ms. Andrews getting close to him? But that's pretty common tabloid fare, isn't it?
Well, "refreshing like a spring breeze" is his motto...
(Sounds like the pollen is not treating him well this year...)
A secret...?
D-Do you really think so?
B-But her death was a suicide, right?
A riddle...?
(A suicide note that just vanished, huh...)
(Still as stuck up as ever...)
(Why don't you just tell it to me straight and say, "I don't have any info"?)
(That's... Franziska von Karma!)
Um, well, you see... I'm his lawyer, so...
Following you...?
Pearls...
(So that noise we heard was this receiver... I feel really sorry for poor Detective Gumshoe now...)
(What were those two talking about...?)
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Why was Juan Corrida murdered? If you ask me, I think you know the reason he was killed.
Why are you hiding things? Don't you realize you're putting Mr. Engarde's life in danger by your actions?
You were not that close...?
You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that.
Leads to:
Andrews:
Um...
Yes, well...
(So... I guess she's saying I'm both depressing and stupid...?) But I am certain you were very close with the victim.
You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...?
Well, it seems quite a few people bought into this story.
(...Note to self: Stay on her good side.)
I see... However... What if there was a need for you to get close to someone...?
Didn't you get close to Mr. Corrida for this person's sake...?
Leads to:
Andrews:
Wh-What?
B-But... You're a manager...
O-Oh.
(Is this my subtle hint to "go home"...?) But... I know you must have had a need to get close to the victim.
Celeste Inpax, your mentor.
Ms. Inpax... She committed suicide, didn't she?
But it looks like no one knows why. Right before her death, she was Juan Corrida's manager. So, I believe you got close to Mr. Corrida so you could find out more about her suicide.
M-Ms. Andrews...?
(Is that really true...? Was there really no mystery at all?) I don't believe you were completely at ease with the way her suicide was resolved!
Leads to:
Andrews:
Huh?
(Which translates to... "Go take a long walk off a short pier"...?)
...Ms. Inpax's suicide note was never found, was it?
It looks like the police were under the suspicion that someone had hidden it. Like maybe the person who discovered her body, Mr. Corrida.
And, Ms. Andrews, I believe you thought the same thing! That is why you became intimate with Mr. Corrida!
...
(That's the impression you like to give, however...) I don't think that's who you really are.
I have evidence that says otherwise. This is proof that Celeste Inpax was someone very special to you...
Leads to:
Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews?
...?
"Pity"...?
(*sigh* This evidence isn't strong enough to give up the truth.)
Ms. Andrews... You... You went through it too, didn't you?
A suicide.
Ms. Andrews, you look and act like a very strong woman who has it all together. You don't ask for anyone's help and you live by yourself.
However, that is all just a lie. A façade.
You've always searched out people on whom you can depend on.
You were dependent on Ms. Inpax, weren't you? Which is why... When she passed away, you lost everything you had.
You must have heard about the police report... The one that said the police suspected Mr. Corrida of hiding Ms. Inpax's note... You heard about it, and thought to recover it from him by getting close, am I right?
If that's the case, then everything changes.
What topic did we start this conversation on again?
Exactly. Somehow, Ms. Andrews... It seems that you have become the one most likely to want Mr. Corrida dead...
Ms. Inpax was everything to you. ...And then she died. And you would do anything to find out why she killed herself. ...Even commit murder.
I... I'm sorry.
Please, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth.
So you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?
Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.
I understand.
A-A-Alright! I understand! We'll keep it a secret! (Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the "always thinking" type... She never says anything carelessly, it seems...)
What is it?
(That card...? Yeah, I guess she has...) Ms. Andrews, what is that card you're holding...?
What is it? It looks like... A seashell?
(Her not remembering something clearly? Sounds like it would be a rare occurence.)
Well, I think we've gathered about all we can...
(Oh, Pearls... She looks so worn out by all this... She hasn't slept at all, and has been walking all over the place with me today...)
Let's go back to the office for a little while. You're really tired, right?
(You don't look fine to me...)
...I don't think they'd ever do that. They're probably in yet another meeting.
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for a stake-out.
Well, we did find one thing out for sure. Ms. Andrews has a motive.
That's right. She was also the one to discover the victim's body. Clever...
Hello!? This is the law office of Wright & Co!
M-Maya! Where's Maya!?
Wh-What!?
Wait! Maya! Let me hear her!
Maya! Is that you!?
Maya! Maya! ...Dammit! He cut me off!
"Sis"...? What does she mean by that...?
Um, s-sorry... ...Ack!! Mia!
What's going on with Maya is the most important thing right now! I should talk with Mia...
How's Maya!?
I'm glad to hear she's safe... But Mia, how did you know...?
(I didn't know you could use spirit channeling like this... Pretty smart of her...)
The kidnapper! What's he like!?
And!?
Argh...
(Yeah... And we should be worrying about Maya right now...)
When you were with her...
...That's what it looks like.
In court today, there will be a mountain of evidence that will implicate you.
I'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.
I understand...
Mia...
I know... I can't focus on Maya's situation right now. ...Or Pearls' either. No matter what, I have to focus on winning this case by the end of the day!
(It's him!)
This is Wright!
Maya... She's unharmed, right!?
...!
G...Grrrr...
Present? What in the world would you want to give me!?
Wait!
(The kidnapper sent me a "present"...?)
Ah, um... No one. It has nothing to do with you, so forget you heard anything!
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
I-I don't know, Your Honor! (Why are you getting mad at me!?)
Sh-Shot!?
His "present"...!
(Th-This... This is totally insane!) M-Ms. von Karma! Is she alright!?
(I thought he'd show up...)
...!
(D-Detective Gumshoe...)
Yeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent. (The answer he was "struggling" for... Interesting... Show me this "answer" you finally found, Edgeworth...)
Would you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?
And that's when the victim's body was found, correct?
The person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?
The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?
Then, what about the knife...?
And why did you think that?
But...?
Only the victim's, huh...?
What convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?
So that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...
But there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...
If you say so...
(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)
What!?
Hmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!
Grrrrrrrrr...
But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?
But Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...
Wait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!
Which means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!
(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)
Do you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?
Oh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, "this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume".
...
Anyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.
(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)
Huh?
Urk.
When was this button found?
(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)
How were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?
By examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?
(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)
There is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!
(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)
Y-Yes?
Leads to:
(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)
We're still in a world of trouble...
Wait a second!
So the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client "bought a knife beforehand"?
...Did not buy this knife.
Take a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.
That's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.
The murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!
What!?
H-How so!?
Urk...
(This must be one of those "traps", and I just walked headlong into it!)
(Evidence not yet shown...?)
Um, well...
(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)
(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)
(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)
Leads to:
There's one...
One piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!
(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)
Leads to:
W-Wait!
Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.
However! This glass that is sitting on top of the dresser is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!
W-Well? What do you all have to say...?
Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!
...What!?
(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)
(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)
Mia...
(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)
(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)
The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!
(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)
Wh-What!?
Th-Then...
Fingerprints...
WHAT!?
(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)
Grrr!
"Another witness"...?
(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)
(Um... But those two were the same age...)
Ms. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?
(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)
And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?
Something you were "interested" in? And just what was that?
("Gossip"...?)
Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?
Who in the world was that!?
(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)
You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?
Really?
(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...)
Please tell the court about the man's face in more detail!
His teeth were... shining?
... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!
Hmm...
I guess it really wasn't that important after all.
(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)
Of course it was important, Your Honor!
You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...
Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)
What was the man you saw carrying?
Um...
S-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?
Then how about his left?
... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)
Hmm...
I guess it really wasn't that important after all.
(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)
Of course it was important, Your Honor!
You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...
Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)
Please tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!
But it does.
What thing?
(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)
Um, right...
Hmm...
I guess it really wasn't that important after all.
(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)
Of course it was important, Your Honor!
Don't you see it, Edgeworth?
Your Honor! I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.
You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?
Really?
(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)
Are you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?
(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)
Leads to:
That's bad for us. Really bad.
(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)
Ms. Oldbag...
Do you know what this is?
(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)
(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.
It was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.
...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his "usual racing jacket"!?
Ms. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!
Just say, "It's important" and agree with me for a change!
(I should be the one sighing, not you!)
I... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!
But... But the possibility does exist!
(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)
Would you please get on with your testimony!
Uh, what?
(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)
(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)
Be a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his "racing jacket", and now he's not!?
...Huh?
My dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?
Well...
(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)
And why would that be?
But there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!
(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)
Was there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?
And that included the Jammin' Ninja...?
So let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?
(Can I throw in the towel yet?)
Leads to:
Hmm...
Huh?
(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)
Please take a look at this.
No no, that's not my intention at all...
Your Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?
That is exactly what I am driving at.
If Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!
And why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!
Then let's hear your "possibility"!
(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)
(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)
(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)
(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)
This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!
Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!
Leads to:
("A certain thing"...? What certain thing...?)
(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)
This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.
Which means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.
However, you just said it yourself. "At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder." If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?
Which means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!
And that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!
It's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!
Take another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!
Well, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...
... Aha ha ha...
It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!
But we just established that the witness saw the "Nickel Samurai" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!
Are you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?
...! (She wasn't waiting for the "Nickel Samurai"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?
(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)
(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?
Leads to:
Mia:
(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)
We weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)
This is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.
(The judge seems to be really into the "article"... If it can be called such a thing...)
(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)
(Never heard that one before...)
(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)
(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)
You can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander!
But the name of the magazine this came from is "Gossip Land"...
Um...
(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)
A scandal...? What do you mean by that?
Ah, no no! I wasn't asking what the word "scandal" means! Even I know that much!
You don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!
(You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.)
I'm not going to let you push me around that easily!
Maybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim!
Oldbag:
(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)
...I don't have anything to offer.
(Me and my big mouth...)
So, what do you mean by "I took action"...?
Wait!
Secret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this "secret information"!?
...
(How in the world did that old bat get such a "secret" piece of information...?)
If you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today!
(And he lectures ME on "reckless blabbering"!?)
(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure out it out!)
(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)
So no one else is supposed to know this "secret information" correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?
Witness! I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?
Leads to:
(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)
(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)
(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)
The "investigative photographer", Lotta Hart...
She reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.
On that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.
No no no, I said impressions.
Ah! That's it! That's the note!
...
(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)
(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)
I guess we should forgive her.
Grr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)
Y-Yeah...
(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)
Witness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?
You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!
Ms. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!
Leads to:
Um...
(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)
Ms. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?
Yesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, "My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!"
If you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!
Ah, that's...!
(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...
There is nothing strange with this photo.
W-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--
Y-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!
Um, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...
There's... There's something strange with this photo!
... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!
Um... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...? It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)
Leads to:
It's this person here, of course!
At the time of the murder, Mr. Engarde was in his own room! Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa--
Urk.
W-Wait!
The strange thing is somewhere around here! ...I think.
A-Am I seeing something you all are not...?
W-Wait!
I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!
If you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.
The "Nickel Samurai" in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!
Let's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster.
Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.
Exactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!
There is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)
Huh? What is?
That's true...
"Along for the ride"...? What do you mean by that?
(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?)
WHAT!?
(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)
(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)
Leads to:
Judge:
Uh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...
(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)
If you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!
For starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.
It means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!
(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!
(Alright! This is it...)
Huh? What do you mean?
One more day...? Ack!! (If I don't get a verdict TODAY, then Maya...!)
(Wh-What am I supposed to do!? The judge is about to adjourn the court!)
(I have to do something... The trial must go on! But I don't have anything left... No evidence, no nothing!)
Please, Your Honor! Continue the trial! You must pass a verdict today!
E-Edgeworth?
Wh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)
She is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... Her.
See, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.
Yes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.
She has her own agenda.
I'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.
...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live. But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killer herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...
And that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!
Um, what...?
... It was Edgeworth...
(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)
...!
Yes... I know.
Disrupt her pace...?
And what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?
(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?
And why did you do that...?
(So the show was supposed to be a "show" of friendship, huh?)
Is that the only reason?
You had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?
(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)
(I should back off... As long as I don't have any proof, she's not going to talk.)
You were "in shock"...?
(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how "close" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)
(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)
Ms. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?
Your mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.
What "one thing"?
(What was she starting to say just now...?)
(Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...)
Y-Yeah, you're right.
Ms. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a "mistake" at the scene of the crime.
What I really want to know is what this "mistake" was.
This is the photo you're referring to, correct?
And the guitar case was like this too?
Leads to:
Juice...?
But you didn't drink any of it, did you?
There were no lip marks left on this wine glass to suggest that anyone drank from it.
Ms. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?
Your mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.
What "one thing"?
(What was she starting to say just now...?)
(Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...)
Y-Yeah, you're right.
Ms. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a "mistake" at the scene of the crime.
What I really want to know is what this "mistake" was.
What kind of flower vase was it?
(That's odd. I thought she was always in total control of herself...?)
Leads to:
(It doesn't sound like there's any glaring contradictions in her testimony just now...)
...Keep on the offensive and not let up.
(I have to find something! I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)
You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?
And are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?
It's not "some" problem, it's a "major" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!
Furthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.
Let's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.
If the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!
No. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!
... That may very well be, however... (An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...)
Well, the case was empty, and I think that's all we really need to know...
Actually, Your Honor, I've changed my mind. I would like her to testify about the case.
(Well, looks like I disrupted the judge's pacing... Now comes the real deal... *gulp*)
The empty guitar case... I believe this is a crucial piece of the puzzle!
(I can't believe I'm doing this either...)
Um, anyway, I'll just go ahead and start the cross-examination...
During your testimony just now, did you remember those events clearly in your mind?
Are you sure you are the one who opened the guitar case?
...
(Her "co-dependency" is coming through, huh...?)
So, you opened the guitar case then?
... Why did you open the guitar case?
Mr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case.
(Why would she care about the bright red guitar...?)
There is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.
It's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!
What do you mean?
Hmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.
(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)
You were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?
Leads to:
(Hurt myself...!?)
(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)
Was it really empty?
I was just wondering if maybe when you opened the case, the guitar was still inside.
Sorry...
There is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.
It's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!
What do you mean?
Hmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.
(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)
You were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?
Leads to:
(Hurt myself...!?)
(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)
Was that because you were "shocked and dazed" at discovering the victim's body?
...
(I'm not going to get anywhere if I continue pressing her like this... The only way to make her talk is with evidence... I guess I should give it a try...)
There is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.
It's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!
What do you mean?
Hmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.
(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)
You were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?
Leads to:
(Hurt myself...!?)
(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)
I wasn't planning on letting up, but...
(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)
I have your proof right here. This wine glass.
You left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.
Even if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?
...? What do you mean?
But it's just an empty case...
B-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!
(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)
No, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase "fell onto the guitar case"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!
Uh...
Um, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...
I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!
Leads to: "Th-This is... This is a photograph...!"
Well... I just thought it might have been possible...?
(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)
Yes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.
It doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!
That insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?
Just outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?
Well, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!
I think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...
Maybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.
And so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!
E-EXCUSE ME!?
... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?
Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.
Yes, that is what I am saying.
... Ah, so that's what he intended...
Huh!? N-No, I just...
Alright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...
Leads to: "What is this...?"
Mia:
I... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!
*gulp*
Ah, sorry...
On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.
Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.
But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.
The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!
Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the "Nickel Samurai"!
That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.
Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!
What!?
P-Protect Mr. Engarde!?
(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)
Would you say that was your "intuition" speaking to you?
Urk...
Three... things?
They didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember...
So would you say this "need" came from the press conference?
But... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.
A-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony!
Has Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally?
You were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out!
(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)
B-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... "Taking a nap in his room"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?
(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)
You can hardly call the knife "decisive evidence"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!
The button...?
Urk.
A-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!
(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)
And how do you know that?
(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)
(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)
Leads to:
But what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.
This witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!
As I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.
Wishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)
Got it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)
This is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was "strangulation by a scarf".
The knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.
Let's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?
Exactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!
That's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!
Let me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?
We now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?
Maybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...
Huh?
W-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!
It was to destroy the evidence, of course!
Um... To destroy the evidence...
Umm...
S-Sorry...
There is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!
There is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!
(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)
The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...
Leads to:
Um, "Wright"?
(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
Ms. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!
"Any evidence"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!
I can't, can I? Would you care to test me?
The knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.
This button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!
The only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.
This is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!
That's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic "dazed discoverer" of a dead body!
And to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.
Speaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?
Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?
(I've got her this time!)
What was that...?
WHAT!? ("Pleading the fifth" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)
(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)
Something I haven't done...?
...!
Wh-What!?
Circumstantial...?
(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?
But! That's not true!
R-Recess...!?
(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a "tomorrow"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)
Please wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!
That... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...
I know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)
But... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right?
Then... who did you pour it for?
Unnngh...
So, it was a "mess"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...?
(Grr...)
Slumped over?
(...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?)
Then what did cross your mind?
Leads to:
You thought he fainted...?
Leads to:
And how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead?
Leads to:
Huh?
(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)
So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?
Even though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?
Isn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!
I doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!
Ms. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!
And your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!
But you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you "might" end up incriminating yourself!
(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)
Usually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.
(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)
Huh...?
Th...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...
(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)
Y-Yes, Your Honor!
(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)
(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)
(No matter what she says... Ms. Andrews is the only person it could be! Not to mention... I don't have a choice. I have to win a complete acquittal today!) Y-Your Honor! The defense believes there is enough evidence to substantiate our claim! Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of "not guilty" as soon as possible!
(I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding!
Sure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!?
(That's the second part of the suicide report; the attempted suicide report!)
(The secret of her co-dependant nature... Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)
(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)
("Last time"...?)
(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)
But you could tell from the state the room was in, that there must have been a fight! Are you telling the truth when you say that you did not know he was dead?
What is this "plan" you had?
That was so you could get the knife, correct?
So you were the one to stab the victim with that knife.
An "inconvenience"...?
(I'm willing to bet my spikes it was Lotta...)
(That's Ms. Oldbag for you...)
You were the one who prepared that costume, weren't you?
(I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...)
N-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise.
(Franziska, huh...)
...
W-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still...
!
B-But!
(Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!)
...! (Edgeworth...?)
"The room"...?
You found that card... next to the victim's body?
(Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...)
E-Edgeworth...?
(I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life... That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?)
There, there, Pearls...
L-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out.
The condition was that we had to get a "not guilty" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a "guilty" sentence yet!
Cheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going!
Yes, that's right. So...
(...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed "Mr. Scruffy Detective" in Pearls' book now...)
(But we're kind of busy right now...)
Ah, it's OK... I already did that...
(Did he just call the watering can, "Mr."?)
Y-Yeah, that's right.
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
P-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing...
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
(What a mess. Literally...)
So, what are you going to do from now on?
Well, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet?
Wh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday!
S-SAY WHAT!?
W-Well... yeah...
A-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish?
(Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?)
...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing.
Why would she want to -- no, I mean, almost "need" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day!
Not a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe...
(Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!?
B-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in "stable condition", but...
Which one...?
N-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it...
Now I'm DEFINITELY not going.
(That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...)
Look, it's my attorney's badge.
(I... I'm really touched...)
...No... not yet.
You're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that.
(I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?)
Go on...
The question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde.
Yeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know.
(I guess a big voice really does give you a sense of presence...)
(What are those two doing...?)
Oh.
Yeah, you can't count on your looks alone.
Is she alright...? After being shot, I mean...
The wound to her pride?
Oh...
(But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...)
Um... So, where is she right now...?
(The detention center, huh...)
(Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide... Now the question is, who is Ms. Andrews relying on now...?)
Could you please take a look at this...?
Th-That's OK... Really.
(From what the guard told me... It sounds like along with Mr. Engarde, Ms. Andrews is also being detained here.)
Yeah, but both of them are still in questioning.
(Yeah, visiting hours are almost over...)
Smile, you're on candid camera.
This guard monitor's the visitor's room. Catching a few z's while he's standing; now that's a good way to spend free time.
*gasp* Ms. Oldbag!
Umm... What does your helmet have to do with anything?
(I'm not hearing this...)
(Argh. Looks like in order to search around here... I have to first get this kooky "alien" to go away...)
Um...
(Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky "alien"...)
Umm... Could you please take a look at this...?
(Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky "alien"...)
Hmm... They're probably strengthening the evidence for tomorrow's trial.
... Actually, Pearls, never mind. It sounds like they're working on a different case...
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... He must be doing image training for corporate interviews.
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
(I have a sneaking suspicion that even Gumshoe could do this guy's job...)
(...Never thought I'd ever come back to this place...)
Ah, hi... ...Wait a second! You're...!
Why are you still here!?
E-Edgeworth...
(It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this "Director" and his secret...)
(Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!)
This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients.
(...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?)
(I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?)
H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!?
(There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...)
This patient is undergoing rehabilitation.
Hey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here!
This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's "Word to the Wise": "Put your best foot forward." Putting this up at a general clinic like this is doesn't really mean much, does it...?
(Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...)
(I think I know what "deal" he's referring to...)
Ms. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you?
In order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today.
Y-You're denying it!?
All while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime?
Aah!
(I guess that's all I get...)
...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, "If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty."
Because of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end...
But you had to know she was... OWWW!
(Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...)
What happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all...
I mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...!
By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you.
That card... What in the world is it?
I-I understand.
(An assassin!?)
So who is this "Shelly de Killer"?
So because his professional name is "Shelly", he leaves cards with a shell on them...?
His "duty"?
...I see...
(I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case?
(Shelly de Killer, huh...)
You sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe.
(He's got a point...)
(I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped.
An acquittal.
Stop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity!
There's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on.
There's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way!
Please, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that.
No way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...)
Maya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound!
Hm? O-Oh yes, Pearls? (Got caught up in my thoughts about Maya's situation...)
(I guess for now, I have no choice but to believe in Mr. Engarde. But I think I should listen to his story one more time...)
Alright! Let's get going too.
(Argh... I have too many questions I need to ask...) I-I'm sorry, but I'm Phoenix Wright, a lawyer for one of the...
A message...?
I don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... "To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you." (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?)
...
Y-Yeah, I guess...
(A client's request is a request... Guess I should go check up on his cat.)
(Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...) Um... Ms. Oldbag... If you would look at...
(Ugh... Is that her perfume, Phéromone d'Amour, I smell...? *shudder*)
"Y-Yours truly"!?
That may be, but you know nothing's going to come of it.
Owww... (Every time we talk about love, I always end up with a handprint on my face somehow.) Um, so anyway, let's continue our investigation.
Ack! What!? What now!?
(I wonder if they're the team in charge of investigating "De Killer"...?)
It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...
It was really the victim, Juan Corrida, trying to disclose something about Mr. Engarde.
They may look like heroes on the outside, but on the inside, they're only human.
(Hmm, sure is dark...)
Wow... So this is what a star's house looks like. Must be nice to be rich.
So I guess this is Shoe.
(The cat seems to like Pearls.)
!
Oh, uh, we're lawyers. Actually, I'm Mr. Engarde's lawyer.
Y-Yes.
Nice to meet you.
That's actually a fireplace.
... (You know, I've never actually seen a hearth before, come to think of it...)
... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own.
But sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly.
It's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...?
Yeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo.
... (I don't know whether to laugh or cry that I know more about that show than a kid...)
There's another door over there.
...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...)
I bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use.
(The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.)
You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?
...
And, uh, anything else?
(Hmm... How typically "butler-like", as it were...)
Mr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...?
...
And, uh, anything else?
(You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a "maid" over a butler...)
That's a very cute cat you've got here.
...
And, uh, anything else?
(...Well then. I guess I don't need this piece of scrap paper anymore.)
You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?
...
And, uh, anything else?
(Hmm... How typically "butler-like", as it were...)
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this.
(Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.)
Would you happen to know who this person is...?
(Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?)
Oh, we should probably get going ourselves.
But there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all.
Looks like we're the only ones here.
(Probably because the police team is scouring for clues about "De Killer"...)
Yeah, me too...
Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!
L-Lotta... You're still here...
(Why can't you drop that "thief" thing already?)
(Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.)
Ah... I wonder if... Lotta also...
(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)
Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are.
It's a sunflower... I think.
That's a tulip, I guess.
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Matt Engarde's Room".
(I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...)
I want to ask you about the night of the murder.
Lotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not?
(Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...)
(Looks like she wasn't here the entire time, that night...)
(I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...)
So, about the note that was inside your camera case.
Yeah... Can I believe what you've written?
Yeah...
What?
...
Hmph.
Well, that's kind of how it is...
Y-You want me to do what!?
Why don't you do your own dirty work...?
Um, would you please take a look at this?
Um, what? A steaming hand towel...?
(How convenient! Maybe I'll have to use that one next time you show me something!)
Umm... Yeah, I guess so.
O-OK, I'll see you then...
Would you please just leave already!?
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Juan Corrida's Room". (I wonder what EXACTLY happened in the room behind this door...? Even now, no one really has any idea...)
Wh-What is that otherworldly, ghastly moaning...!?
I don't think it's a ghost... Maybe it's a demon!?
Zoinks! It's the alien!!
Oh, it's just you, Ms. Oldbag. What are you doing here?
Yup. It's big, but it's a bed.
(How easily children are entertained.)
Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.
They're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over.
Yeah.
W-Well, it was a "press conference", so he had to go in costume.
They weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals.
(Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.)
It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.
There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.
Please talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time.
(Now I've seen everything...)
I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida.
But I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde...
Yeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at.
Hm? What is it, Pearls?
(She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...)
All of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears...
D-Did all that really happen?
(What a load of crock!)
Yeah... Nice... Bears...
Wh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!?
Urk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second...
(Time sure flies... Hard to believe it's been two days since the ceremony...)
(The transceiver!)
Hello!? Hello!?
Maya! How is Maya!? You haven't hurt her, have you!?
...!
One more day! Please! All I ask is for one more day! I... I'll get a not guilty verdict for sure this time! Please...
...Please... Please let Maya say something! I want to hear she's alright!
(What is with this static all of a sudden...!) Hello!? Hello!?
(Dammit! Did the transceiver just suddenly break...!?)
I don't know. All of a sudden, it became nothing but static.
(Why did the transceiver suddenly break like that...? I should probably have an electronics expert look at it... The sooner the better!)
Th...That's nice... Thanks.
I'm sorry you went through all the trouble to cook, but I don't have the time to eat.
(You've got to be kidding... And here I thought he had already whipped something up.)
(Well, since he's here and offering... I wonder what I should try asking him about?)
Oh yeah! This thing just up and broke all of a sudden!
When I was talking to the kidnapper, it just suddenly broke into static...
Look, it sounded like this.
...
H-Huh??
That's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise.
Maybe what?
"Electromagnetic interference"?
Oh yeah! Do you know about this card?
Edgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card.
You do?
...
Um, that's it?
(As I suspected, Gumshoe has no clue...)
Um... So what is "electromagnetic interference"...?
Oh, when you put it that way...
(She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...)
Ah!
Ah, wait! Gumshoe!
Alright, let's go!
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
S-Sorry to keep you waiting.
... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item!
It looks a little... broken.
Oh? By who?
...
But...?
(I'm getting that sinking feeling again...)
It's a plain old calculator.
(A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...)
Well, it certainly looks like an alarm clock.
I just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago...
Well, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here.
Looks like it's been on "keep warm" all this time since the murder.
(I think the "keep warm" in that case is a little more metaphorical...)
It's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo.
That's what it seems like.
(Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...)
It's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here.
H-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK?
There's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh.
... Do you know what a "notebook" is?
Well, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop.
I really don't think the listening device is in something like this.
Uh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?)
Oh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out.
I don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry.
O-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...)
Well, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner.
Y-Yeah...
(I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?)
O-Oh, nothing.
I don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places.
Yeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones.
...Um, yeah.
(I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...)
Lamp, check. Listening device... nope.
Yeah.
...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry.
A cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here.
Wh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is!
(Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...)
Well, the phone is the most common place for a "listening device", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here.
Yeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...)
...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...)
Ah, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots.
Y-Yeah, it's a real one.
Y-Yes?
Horsies...? ...
Um... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh...
... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls?
(This sweeper isn't exactly the best... Well, make do with what you have, right?)
Th-That's!
A whattawhatta-mitter?
So this tiny thing is a camera...?
So it's a video camera...
But... there's no video tape in this camera...
So... what is a "transmitter"?
It looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing...
Eight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!)
Wh-What!?
And it was disguised as a present.
But... who gave Mr. Corrida this present?
(Is there really no way to find out...?)
Yeah.
Yes.
(Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...)
But what would something like this be doing in...?
(Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!)
(Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?)
(Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.)
Wh-What!?
Wh-What are you going to do?
B-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM!
...Yeah.
(Ack!)
E-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!?
I-I see... Thanks.
?
Wh-What?
W-Well, I guess so...
?
W-Wait!
Why are you doing this...?
The "real killer"...
To be honest... I don't know anymore.
(Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth!
(These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK.
So the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was...
And the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client?
That person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer.
(I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?)
(...Matt Engarde himself...?)
Then he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime.
...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?
(I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...)
Yeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting.
Oh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls?
I don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this "secret". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.)
(I'm guessing by "miracle", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.)
Stop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls.
Yeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry.
Ah, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job...
Sorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake.
(Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...)
I... I wouldn't know...
... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!)
Yeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth.
(She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK?
(Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?)
Yeah. It's past 9:00 PM already. But we still have some things to prepare for tomorrow's trial. (There's still the matter of this "secret" Mr. Corrida held about Mr. Engarde... And Ms. Andrews' real intentions. These are two things I must know tonight!)
Hmm... I'm sure we'll think of something, Pearls. Don't you worry.
Hey! Wait!
That's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...)
Edgeworth...?
(Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!)
They haven't cleaned up all the food yet.
(Wow, the digestive powers of an alien are wondrous...)
Yeah, me too...
Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!
(I was NOT talking to you!)
Hmm, very interesting.
Oh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...)
(Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!)
(But I didn't say anything...)
Oh?
Oh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right?
M-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida?
(Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?)
What!?
I-Is that true?
...I see.
How terrible...
On that night, there must've been at least a few hundred people here. Hmm... I guess the police are done with their questioning and investigating. It looks like things here in the lobby have finally calmed down.
A lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. When the murder happened, it was abuzz with people running back and forth... But now since things have quieted down, it actually feels more eerie than before.
It looks like no one is around...
(Oh, she must mean that butler with the stitches in his face.)
(I wonder if that butler, Mr. Doe, is already asleep or not...)
Well, he's out there with that camera asking around at all the electronic stores.
(It looks like Pearls really appreciates what Gumshoe is doing for us...)
Hm? Yes?
...I don't think I've ever bought lettuce before.
(Guess the lack of lettuce is kind of a problem.)
Ah, it's OK... Gumshoe already gave it more than plenty earlier...
(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
It's fine. Really. If you wipe it any more, it'll be so shiny I'll be using it as a mirror.
Visiting hours ended a few hours ago. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to talk with Mr. Engarde tonight...
(Yeah, but I don't think that matters to the guard...)
Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's the camera watching over now?
(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)
Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's he watching over now?
(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)
(Yeah, it does. I wonder if something happened...?)
Ah, yes sir.
A "decisive witness"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case?
(What's Edgeworth up to now...?)
(Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!)
He did?
Thank you very much.
("Go talk to your heart's content"? It sounds like the police are pretty sure they have tomorrow's trial in the bag.)
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... Stop doing image training, and get yourself out there in the field!!
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
(Have a little more faith in your own subordinates!)
Wow, that's really something.
(I'm sure they must have transferred Ms. Andrews here by now... So that means that both Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews are in this detention center. Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)
I... hope so too... (Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me and said... that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that assassin's client is... this man... Matt Engarde...)
...Mr. Engarde. There is something I must know with one hundred percent certainty.
This guard monitor's the visitor's room. He's sleeping standing up. The night's pretty long, and he probably got tired. Hmm... I hope he doesn't fall over...
Um, about the "press conference"...
Yeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews.
Could you please fill me in on what this "secret" is? Please?
(I knew this was coming...)
(A Psyche-Lock...)
This is a very important matter! Please! You must tell me! What is this "secret"!?
H-Hello? This is Phoenix Wright.
... (Looks like I have no choice but to remove those Psyche-Locks...)
Did you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...?
Ms. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him.
Does that jog any memories...?
Let's go eat one later, OK?
That's too bad...
(Mr. Engarde... Are you connected to Ms. Inpax's suicide in some way...?)
That's what I heard.
(Why does what he just said give me a sinking feeling?)
Um, I'm not someone who would know...
(Isn't your show a kid's show too?)
W-Well, that's because he really IS dead!
That's something I would like to know too. Do you have any ideas at all? Even the slightest clue?
...Mr. Engarde?
Um... What do you mean by that?
Um, about this...
Huh?
Oh, this? Um... Nothing. It's nothing, really.
(... I'm kind of scared to show him this card...)
Oh, um... So about this picture card... Have you ever seen this before?
(I don't think he's lying... Or is he...? Then again, he looked like he gasped just now... Maybe I'm seeing things...?)
(Mr. Engarde sounds pretty sincere and he seems trustworthy... So I have to find out what Ms. Andrews' real intentions are!)
About this person...
Could you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you...
(I swear... After this case is over, I'm going to get lots and lots of sleep...)
I'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight.
(I'm sure Ms. Andrews knows something... She can't be clueless about this "secret" Mr. Corrida had on Mr. Engarde...)
I'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind...
... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival?
About Ms. Celeste Inpax...
I... I'm sorry.
You wanted to "burn it"? But why?
(The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?)
Why did you try to frame Mr. Engarde?
The police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right?
Well, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did...
(A Psyche-Lock, huh...)
(I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, "Revenge".)
Why did you frame Mr. Engarde...?
(I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, "Revenge" to herself.)
Mr. Corrida...? But...
(Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.)
So there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct?
About this photo...
And that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...?
(His "true nature"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.)
But you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right?
I-I'm so sorry!
(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)
S-Sorry...
Um, I'd like to ask you about this...
(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)
(Uh oh...) M-Mr. Powers!
(So the decisive witness... is Mr. Powers?)
O-Oh.
(Hmm... Well, I guess I can see how they thought you looked suspicious...)
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
... I think he's lost his grip on what's real and what isn't...
So, about this "testimony" you're giving. What are you going to talk about?
You saw something important? What was it?
I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me.
(Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I...?)
But what is he really like?
One person who wouldn't swoon over him?
(Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?)
A dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers?
Well, that's true.
You mean Ms. Inpax?
(Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...)
We heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...)
Why do you figure so?
An "insidious man"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?
I see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you.
(Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews; they're both at the detention center right now. There are still things I don't understand or know about, I'm sure... I have to get the two of them to tell me everything!)
Well... He tried, but there was a lot of interference.
(That radio interference... Who would've thought it was caused by a spy camera?)
Y-Yeah, I guess so.
Um... "You too"...?
(Do you think we could somehow get back to THIS article...?)
Oh... That's nice...
(Looks like Mr. Powers is just as in the dark about things as I am. I guess I don't have a choice other than to go talk to the two of them myself.)
(Hmm... So Mr. Powers likes this type of woman...) What do you know about Ms. Andrews...?
(He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...)
Ah, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.
I don't like the sound of this ringtone right now... It sounds kind of ominous.
Hello--
Wh-What's wrong!?
(Edgeworth...?)
...Hello? He got cut off.
Gumshoe said we need to go back to the office right away.
...I'm scared to go back.
Um...
(Somehow, I doubt that...)
Well? What happened?
Th-This quickly?
The bear...
Shh, Pearls. ...And? Go on.
(And here I thought things couldn't get any worse...)
Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was...
A receipt...? That's all you have?
(My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!)
So what about the spy camera we found...?
Nope. Not a word since we were cut off by the radio interference.
You mean setting the spy camera up in the victim's room...?
(Then what "way" did you mean it?)
Hmm... I wonder what she is doing right now...?
(Yeah, that's right. She's still at the detention center.)
(I never thought... I didn't think it was possible... The person who put the spy camera in Juan Corrida's room was Matt Engarde!)
"I bet" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera.
Yes.
(I'm scared myself, but I have to put on a good face for Pearls... Matt Engarde! What in the world have you done!?)
Well, it's not really a device for the purpose of spying. The way any device is used is decided by the people who use them.
(This bear... It's an expensive luxury brand from overseas.) But it's OK, Pearls. Now it's helping us by giving us a clue... It's telling us who the real culprit is so we can get some justice.
I think it's time you told me the truth.
5 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Now, let's hear what this "secret" of yours is. What if Mr. Corrida had been successful in his plan? What would he have disclosed...?
Don't lie to me.
I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!
Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.
And then sent the images the camera took with this transmitter.
The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!
A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan!
Engarde:
I know...
What made you say that all of a sudden?
Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet.
This bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder. A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan!
Yes, I hear it's quite expensive. Which is why it is very odd that this gadget was found inside this bear!
This is a very small video camera. And it was hidden inside this bear's eye.
Well, whatever this "bear" saw was sent somewhere using this transmitter. Which means... Someone, on the night of the murder, was secretly filming Mr. Corrida's room!
Engarde:
I know...
What made you say that all of a sudden?
Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet.
Well, Mr. Engarde?
Um...
(I can't believe he can be so flippant at a time like this...) Um, Mr. Engarde... I don't think you need to snort while you laugh. Really.
Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a "fan".
The person who gave this bear to Mr. Corrida was...
Leads to:
Well, Mr. Engarde?
Um...
(...That's strange. I thought the answer was right there in front of me...)
Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...?
Aww, but he says he knows you. How could you forget such a great friend?
He says that the one who put the camera in his eye was you, Mr. Engarde.
Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.
Here is proof that it was you who put the camera inside the bear:
Leads to:
Well, come on, Mr. Engarde!
Um...
(Is he telling me to think carefully before I speak...? Argh! So close and yet so far!)
I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde. It's from when YOU bought that stuffed bear!
A-A THIRTY-EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR TOOTHBRUSH!?
(Eww... Elephant hair? Is that what rich people use nowadays...?) Anyway! The store clerk clearly remembers you and your purchase. After all, you even gave him an autograph, did you not!?
Yes?
Because if I don't know the truth, I can't help you.
No, not yet. I haven't asked why you set the camera up yet.
And what your "secret" is. Of course, it would be strictly confidential...
I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must. The reason you hid this camera in Mr. Corrida's room and filmed it in secret is...
Leads to:
Engarde:
There is a rumor going around... That Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida were having secret meetings.
You, who was keeping tabs on Mr. Corrida... You were going to reveal this as fact, and turn it into a scandal. Isn't that right!?
Huh?
...The "good stuff"...? "Juicy"...?
... Too bad, that wasn't your intention.
I wish your reason for spying was something so innocent. But it wasn't. You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews... Then there's only one reason I can think of for you to do such a thing.
The real reason you set up that camera in Mr. Corrida's room was...
Leads to:
Engarde:
Huh? My office...?
(Argh! I'm so close! I can feel it!) I-If you're done laughing!
Engarde:
Mr. Engarde?
Um... (I have to somehow get it through his head I'm not giving up.)
Sorry, but no.
(Maybe he doesn't know about this card...) This is a certain man's "calling card"... The man's name is Shelly de Killer... and I'm sure you know of him, don't you?
If you really don't know him, then why are you acting so jumpy all of a sudden?
(This is it! I'm finally starting to get to the truth! I can't afford to make any more mistakes now...) Mr. Matt Engarde. I know why you know Mr. de Killer. It's because...
It's because you're the great hero of justice, the Nickel Samurai!
You spied on that room to do one thing and one thing only! To expose Shelly de Killer's fiendish plot!
... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue...
It's because you're a star!
Well, you're a star. And stars never need a logical, or sane reason for anything!
... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue...
Since you're the one who set up that camera... That means you knew... You knew exactly what was going to happen in that room!
So... How? How would you know something like that...? It's because you're his client. That's why. You hired Shelly de Killer to assassinate Mr. Juan Corrida! The real mastermind behind this whole murder is... You, Matt Engarde!
...!
M-Mr. Engarde... You really did hire...!?
(Consult... "myself"...??)
About time for what?
You really... So you were Shelly de Killer's client!?
(He knew about Ms. Andrews' secret...?)
What...?
This is all because of that press conference, isn't it...?
...
H-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone.
You... You... You killed Mr. Corrida!
Grr...
...
...Y...You... scoundrel...
I... I'll get you for this!
(Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?)
Edgeworth...
... What... What should I do...?
My... Turn?
I'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh!
"Proper defense"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery?
Uh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all!
I became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain...
But... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do!
Huh?
(Now's not the time to talk about evidence...)
People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty!
And!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty!
What do you...?
I don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now?
...
...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!?
Don't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself!
...Y-Yeah.
Wh-What the heck is "aftercare"?
An assassin's... "duty"...?
Wh-What is your name!?
You did... But...
M-Maya!
...Edgeworth!
Did you hear that? At the end of that transmission...
(It can't be... that cat... Can it...?)
I think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately!
Don't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun!
(Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)
...I see.
(Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...)
Maya!
I can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...
This is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace.
(I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...?
Generally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but...
Yeah...
You seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details...
Y-Yeah... I guess that makes sense...
It looks like there's another room in the back.
I bet it's for the cat to use.
A bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...?
Do you think that this... came through that little door...?
Well, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth!
Argh! There's no one here!
An antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!)
A huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say,
Yeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered...
It's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape.
It's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help?
... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...)
It's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there.
What a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here.
I can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows...
I'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...)
... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...)
And now... we've lost our only lead.
...Yeah, you're right.
(Maya...)
Well, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want.
The light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here.
(If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.)
This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... ("With love... Celeste")
Yes, Mr. Corrida's former manager.
(And why does it say, "With love"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...)
What's wrong, Pearls?
(Huh? What's so special about the frame?)
Wh-What!?
...
Oh, um, nothing.
...Edgeworth.
As far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get.
But I'm still short one last thing...
(Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.)
Um... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock.
Ms. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock.
I want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret.
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Can you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder?
(No, that's not it! I know you have a personal reason to dislike Mr. Engarde.) Ms. Andrews. You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, "Revenge."
(Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependant on another person...) (There is something or someone in her past that would make her take revenge...)
Leads to:
Andrews:
What? What am I doing?
Th-That's not what I was trying to do at all!
(I guess I screwed up big again...)
There is only one catalyst that could cause such strong feelings, and even revenge. And that is Ms. Inpax's suicide.
...
You're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide.
Leads to:
Andrews:
Yes...
W-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's...
(Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!)
This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though.
"With love... Celeste". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it?
Yeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion.
Yes... But I heard that it didn't work out.
(I think I can see where this is going.)
So that's why... "With love... Celeste" is written on the frame of that picture.
I see... So that's what happened.
Revenge... There's that word again.
And that was at the press conference after the stage show...
...
... I... I'm a lawyer...
... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me.
(I can't sleep either... Not with Maya's situation... or with what I know now...)
...*huff*...*huff*... Grr!! How did I get into this mess...?
Wha...!? What have I done wrong!?
...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!
Hello, this is Phoenix Wright.
...
Grr...!
(...Maya...)
M-Mia! Maya! How's Maya!?
You don't know...?
Mia... What... What am I supposed to do...?
B-But!
Stop it, please! There's nothing left... Not here, not anywhere...
(Argh! It's that accursed Engarde again...)
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!? Look, don't call me anymore! I mean it!
Aaah! Gumshoe! I'm really, really sorry! Where are you?
...! Then, you have some sort of lead...!?
Gumshoe...
(That's true, I could do that if they found Maya first...)
I have to make the trial last longer?
(Oh, now I get it...)
Got it! Thanks Gumshoe!
...Yeah! (Looks like we're coming to the end... I have to make the trial last as long as I can! Gumshoe will come through, I know it!)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
...!
(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)
I wonder how the trial will turn out today...?
...! (I... I didn't know that...)
(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)
Huh?
The defendant's room? Why did you go there?
Wh-Wh-What is it?
Huh?
Um, no one said you were, Mr. Powers.
("Every time"...?)
(Hey, wait a minute! When and how did I suddenly turn into the bad guy here??)
Are you sure that was Matt Engarde?
(If that's the case, then he really can't be mistaken...)
"At first"? What do you mean by that?
...Sounds like an ordinary bellboy to me.
And why was that?
H-How am I supposed to know!?
(I guess I'm going to have to wait patiently on this one...)
"At first"? What do you mean by that?
And why was that?
H-How am I supposed to know!? (...Hey, wait a second...) Actually, Mr. Powers, only a few minutes ago, you stated:
Could it be that you felt something "strange" about the tip-giving incident itself...?
So he gave the bellboy a tip. What's so strange about that?
"How much it was"...?
(It sounds like Mr. Powers was surprised twice by this event. I wonder which of his shocking moments I should ask about...?)
What was so shocking about the bellboy's face, Mr. Powers?
... Ah! (He was there... At Engarde's house... He was that BUTLER!)
A-Ah, nothing, Your Honor! (So that means Engarde was talking with De Killer then. If that fact were to be exposed, Engarde would be declared guilty in a blink!)
Yes, Chief!
Huh? Umm... What did you just say, Your Honor?
You saw the two of them, the bellboy and the defendant, together, correct?
Now, while you were watching the two of them, did you notice anything strange?
A tip? (But that's a perfectly normal thing to do...)
So who are these "guests" you're talking about?
(This is like squeezing water from a stone... It's probably pointless to press further...)
I don't remember that happening at all. Maya was making such a racket in her hyper state... I ended up focusing on her.
The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?
("A little too much"...?)
A ROLL OF CASH!?
(The judge is beginning to look awfully suspicious of us...)
The defendant is a superstar! That kind of tip is typical fare for people like him!
(He's got a point... I don't even get paid, let alone rolls of cash for all my hard work.)
(There's nothing I can really object to here. I mean, who can argue that a fat roll of money isn't really odd...?)
...!
WHAAAT!?
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
And what time was it?
Are you sure it was the same bellboy?
And how could you tell? All the bellboys wear the same uniform, after all!
Urk.
The victim's room, huh...?
(Words cannot describe how screwed I am...)
Um... so what exactly was so "out of place" about him?
(Maybe because I have no idea what damaging thing he's going to say next...?)
Empty-handed?
(But is it really that unusual for a bellboy to be empty-handed? What I should I do? Should I let Mr. Powers' testimony slide or...?)
You're right. I think it's pretty unusual too.
There is nothing strange or unusual about an empty-handed bellboy!
There really, really isn't!
(Grr... Edgeworth... Are you going to do whatever you can to make the bellboy look suspicious?)
So you're saying that it's suspicious for him to be empty-handed?
Juice...? What kind of juice was it?
Proof, huh? (Sounds like another job for the Court Record!)
Leads to:
Please don't be so quick to judge!
(Well, I guess a thief and an assassin are both sneaky and silent...)
But... he really is the assassin, you know?
Mr. Powers.
You're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.
So? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?
I would like to ask the court to please take a look here.
There is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a tray with a bottle of tomato juice on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!
Ah, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?
(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)
Huh? Wh-What...?
Gloves?
(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!) So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!
So? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?
Urgh...
The rest...?
(Some accident! I'd say you saw too much! And all of it was suspicious to high heaven...)
Yes, Your Honor...
Is that what you saw while you were busy spying?
(I knew he was spying!)
I said, "Hold it!"
That's better! *ahem* What kind of statement is that!? Please elaborate and give us a few more details!
(Hmm, I should probably ask him only one question at a time...)
So who took this "something" the bellboy handed off?
What do you mean?
Then you're saying you didn't see the person's face?
He gave "something" to this person?
And what was this "something"?
(I don't think I can find out much more from Mr. Powers... I should probably move on to a different topic...) So what did the bellboy do after that?
A statue?
(Looks like for this trial to proceed... I'm going to have to come up with whatever this "statue" thing is and show it to him.)
Leads to:
Where did this bellboy go after he left Mr. Engarde's room?
(Nngh... I do...)
Did you see anything strange, suspicious, or just out of the ordinary at that time?
What!? (He saw something else!?)
... Um, I think we can forget about the alien...
Well, Mr. Powers' testimony just now was just as vague as his first.
Ugh... Talk about a lose-lose situation.
...
Uh, it was me, Your Honor...
I have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...
Y-Yes, Your Honor. (OK Phoenix, deep breath...) Mr. Powers. The "something" you saw... Was it this item?
Yeah... Sorry, Mia.
(Ah, I almost forgot that he knew about it too...)
(I... I can't let this happen! I have to do something... There has to be something we've overlooked!) Your Honor! A minute, please!
There are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!
Mr. Powers' testimony, of course!
Urk.
Aaah!
P-Please! Wait!
(Because I can't let it end like this!) I know my outburst just now was a little... questionable.
But! There really are some questionable points left to discuss, Your Honor!
There was one thing in Mr. Powers' testimony that was very unclear. And that is the identity of the person who received the bear!
As long as we don't know who it was that took the bear, we can't be sure of...
...?
Wha--!?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!
(How many times is that today? ...I've lost count...)
What am I supposed to do now!? Mia, help!
Your Honor!
(I have to find something... Even one more little point will do!) There are... There are still questions left unanswered!
I think it's fairly obvious that the bear itself is very questionable!
This was found at Mr. Engarde's mansion. However, Mr. Engarde was arrested at the hotel that night! Which means that since the murder occurred, he has not had a chance to go home!
I think Your Honor has already figured out what I'm trying to say. It is not possible that it was Mr. Engarde who took this bear to his mansion!
(Phew... Disaster averted it looks--
Huh!?
I can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...
(This is too much! Isn't there anything I can attack at all?)
(I have to try... I have to find something else!)
I plan to expose a clearly shaky place in Mr. Powers' testimony!
There is indeed, Your Honor. And it's quite a questionable point!
... (I knew it would turn out this way... After all, what Edgeworth has stated is the truth...)
(Well, do I...? What should I do...?)
... The defense... rests--
!
Mia...
(...............)
(There is only one way for me to drag this trial out... The only thing I have left is this one dirty trick...) Your Honor. Right now, we have these two reasons to believe my client is a client of the assassin. Reason number one. He accepted the bear figurine from the assassin. Reason number two. That very same figurine was found at Engarde Mansion. However! It's possible this is all the work of a certain other person!
What I am saying is, it's possible a different person is De Killer's real client!
Yes.
...
Leads to:
Huh?
...
Yes. We already know that she tried to frame Matt Engarde for the crime... By wearing a spare Nickel Samurai costume!
That could have very well been Ms. Andrews!
If you would please recall yesterday's testimony, the defendant was taking a nap during the break period.
It was a well-laid trap set by Ms. Andrews.
(This is to save Maya... This is to save Maya... Even if the whole world turns against me, this is one fight I can't give up on!)
...!
(He's right... De Killer did specially bring that bear to Engarde right away...) Why do you ask? Is there something special about it?
... (Aaaargh! I swear this demon will pay...)
P-Pearls? Where's Mia?
(A really strong power...?)
(It's from Gumshoe!)
Y-Yeah, sort of... We just barely found something to latch onto.
And what about you!? Anything yet!? Have you figured out where De Killer and Maya are!?
WHAT!? We don't have any more time!
(I was only able to come this far because I kept thinking to myself... I've got to keep the trial going until Maya's been rescued... But have I just run out of luck this time...? Is all our hope for naught...?)
(Huh? A tent!?)
M-Mia!
So it was Maya that called you away!
Gumshoe! Is there a circus in town right now!?
Maya is somewhere within a 300 feet radius of the main tent!
And?
Gumshoe! There's also a mailbox!
What else, Mia!?
Good luck!
Mia! Maya's not hurt, right!?
(Gumshoe! Please hurry!!)
(It's only a matter of time before Maya's rescued... I can do this! I just have to make this trial last a little longer!)
(Why... Why does she...??)
A puzzle?
(True enough... To people who don't know, I'm sure they would never guess that this was a puzzle...) So what kind of puzzle is this exactly?
So you can "take it apart"? And how would one go about doing that?
(A boy and his new toy... It's like he's 5 all over again...)
(I think he's lost it...)
And how do you know about this...?
Huh!?
(So it was a present from Ms. Andrews...)
So who exactly knew how to solve this puzzle?
Who else knows that this bear is actually a small container or "jewelry box"?
The two of you, huh... Then of course that means Mr. Engarde didn't know, right?
Yeah, I'll keep pressing her for more information.
(I think this is about all I'm going to get for now...)
...?
(There's a painful silence hanging over the courtroom... All eyes are on Ms. Andrews now as she solves the puzzle, and takes the bear apart...)
...
"What is written on the note...?"
The judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.
Urk... (How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)
(I know. I have to carry on and buy him some more time! OK. There are 2 deadly pieces of evidence: the figurine and the suicide note. Maybe somehow, I can find a way out of this situation through one of those!)
(The suicide note or the figurine!? Which one of these should I pursue??)
Please wait, Your Honor!
I think Your Honor believes that Matt Engarde killed in order to obtain this note.
But that seems a little strange. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
This note was hidden by Mr. Corrida until the night of the murder. If that is the case... I say that Matt Engarde could not have known what was written on this note!
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. No one in their right mind would kill for a note without first knowing what it said!
Please wait, Your Honor!
The assassin took this with him from the crime scene after murdering Mr. Corrida. At the request of his client, of course.
I don't think it's possible that Mr. de Killer's client was Matt Engarde. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
You can't tell by just looking at it that this bear is really a jewelry box. The chances that Matt Engarde thought the note was inside this bear... Are zero to none!
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. After all, there is no reason why Mr. Engarde would ever want a jewelry box like this!
(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)
...!
(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in my possession...)
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
Well... sort of...
...!
(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)
(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)
(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)
Yes, Chief!?
What I'm going to do next!? (Does running away like a frightened child work?)
Well, what is it, Mia!?
(Something he should investigate?)
(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)
(What is this piece of evidence that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)
(I have no objections to Engarde getting his guilty sentence as he should... But I can't let that happen yet! Mia said there's still something worth examining. If she thinks so, then even if I have to force it, I must find something to bring up!)
...I have an objection, Your Honor.
Your Honor! The defense has no intentions of letting this go so easily!
That's just your imagination, Your Honor! Mr. Edgeworth. This is not like you at all.
In your eagerness to prove your point, you've forgotten one very important thing.
You're so close, Mr. Edgeworth... But there's something you really should examine about this piece of evidence!
Leads to:
Judge:
Whoops!
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
Hmm... Who knows?
I mean, sure, this "suicide note" was found inside this bear. But this bear was in my possession until a few moments ago. Which means... The handwriting on this "suicide note" has yet to be analyzed!
So! As to whether this pivotal piece of evidence was really written by Ms. Inpax or not... Has yet to be even remotely confirmed!
Ms. Andrews... You were the one who tried to pin this murder on Mr. Engarde. Who's to say you didn't create a fake "suicide note" and put it into this bear!?
But if this is a fake, then the witness is the only person who could have made it!
Recall the witness' testimony concerning this figurine! The only person other than the victim who could solve the puzzle is the witness herself!
Ms. Andrews! You wrote this note, didn't you? You wrote it so you could use it to frame Matt Engarde!
Mr. Edgeworth! You were the one who presented this scrap of paper as evidence! That means the burden of proof lies with you, the prosecution!
(The judge is going to carry this trial over one more day. I don't think Maya will physically be able to make it another day!)
(It's Gumshoe!)
Hello!? Gumshoe!?
(What is with him!? And what's with that sigh!?) Where's Maya!? What happened to De Killer!?
WHAT!?
A-Anyway, what's going on!?
But...
Do you hear that? They're calling for his head!
Wh-What is it!?
I-I can't do that!
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
Hold on, Your Honor! Edgeworth! Catch!
Gumshoe:
...!
I'm sorry, Your Honor! But...!
(I... This time, I really can't do anything...)
(E-Edgeworth!?)
Please! Your Honor!
...!
(I'm not sure if this is helping... or hurting us...)
De Killer... It looks like he got away again. Thirty minutes...? We can't find her in that time...
Can we use any of them as evidence?
...?
Really!?
(Sounds bad... I hope he doesn't get in too much trouble over this...)
(Items left by the murderer, huh... Maybe there's something among them that will be decisive enough to end this!)
Wh-What happened?
Wh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!
No! We can't let that happen!
(Why, oh why did Gumshoe have to get into an accident now!? Is there any way to find out exactly where he is at this moment...!?)
That's right! There is a way!
I'm sure we can find out where Detective Gumshoe is through this...!
(Franziska... Will she even want to help us...?)
I guess this won't work, huh...?
(...Did I say something wrong...?)
Argh! It's no use! I can't think of anything!
(...Did I say something wrong...?)
Edgeworth...
I don't have any right to judge anyone ever again...
I know my client is guilty. But what I'm doing now... I'm pinning the guilt onto someone totally innocent, and using the evidence to do so... ... It might be my turn to say, "Defense Attorney Phoenix Wright chooses death"...
The verdict...
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
(What's wrong with Edgeworth...?)
What!?
Mr. C-Corrida...?
(This theory that Engarde had no idea that the suicide note was fake... Something seems a little wrong with it...)
The defense believes that the theory the prosecution has stated contradicts testimony! If everything the prosecution has proven up to this point is true... Then it's impossible for Mr. Engarde to not have know it was a fake!
Leads to: "What is this little item called again...?"
Judge:
(I'm going to take a wild guess and say that I messed up again...?)
Um, a video camera, Your Honor. Well, a very small one, but...
Mr. Edgeworth! Earlier, you claimed that Mr. Engarde knew of the existence of this note because he was spying on the victim. Isn't that right?
If that were true... Then this means Mr. Engarde would have known that the victim had forged the note!
(It's no use... Something feels wrong, but I can't put my finger on what it is...)
(Th-That's it!) Yes, and so naturally... This means Mr. Engarde would have known that the note was a fake!
...Um, yes Your Honor?
Ah, yes... Sorry...
Whaaaaa!? (If only I had kept my mouth shut...)
Exactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's motive for murder was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!
Well, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?
What next...??
(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)
That's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!
Y-Yes?
(Do I have a choice here...? I can't really do much else to drag this trial out...) The defense has no objections, Your Honor.
(Edgeworth... Is there no other way left to us...?)
(So this must be what that urgent phone call he got earlier was about...)
M-M-Maya!
The defense has no objections to this person! We are satisfied that this man is indeed Shelly de Killer!
(Shelly de Killer... What is he going to say...?)
Yes, Your Honor.
We can hear anything you have to say later. Can you please just tell us your client's...?
... S-Sorry... Go on...
(That's only because you don't know about Maya's situation...)
The trust between you and your client...?
But couldn't someone stab you in the back and break your trust?
Y-Yes...?
The trust between you and your client...?
I'm sorry, but I was wondering about something you just said. You said that your client had already "broken the rules"...
And that's why you feel you can betray this person?
(Just my luck... An assassin with a conscience. Who would've figured...?)
(This case just keeps getting better and better!)
Everyone understands your point, I think. Really.
That seems a little strange to me... I mean, you're about to tell us the name of your client. I would think that this would be very bad for them.
(The judge had better watch himself...)
We understand, so please tell us the name of your client!!
(Aaargh! That egomaniacal...)
(Somehow, that coming from an assassin makes it less than comforting...)
Leads to:
(I don't really care about all this extra fluff. Just tell us the name already!)
(I'm not his therapist, you know...)
...
(Umm... Now I can't bring myself to ask the client's name...)
...
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
...!
Wh-What's going on here...?
Stabbed Edgeworth in the back...?
(I knew it...)
Yeah...
Yeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! (Can I live with myself if I win this!?)
Ms. Andrews...
...!
(Yes, I know the truth...)
Yes, Your Honor?
... (I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)
Your Honor! The defense will make a request... ... ... (It's no use... I can't... It feels like I've lost my voice...!)
I can't do it, Mia... I can't accept a not guilty.
I know. But... But Matt Engarde is a killer; a murderer! I can't... I can't let him get away with this. I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be
The defense requests that we be allowed to further question Mr. de Killer.
I'm not done yet. To see through this witness' lies and find the truth... THAT is my job, Your Honor!
(There's still more evidence to look at... And I'm sure that once those pieces arrive here in this very courtroom... a miracle will occur!)
(What is he talking about? "Usually done"...??)
... Your Honor, the defense will question the witness. (As if I have a choice here!)
(...Then I'll expose the lies in that oh-so-"beneficial" testimony, I suppose.)
(That makes two of us...)
...
(If I press him the wrong way, it might raise suspicions on his end... But I have to do something to waste more time...) Um... Witness. About requesting a hit...
How much is your fee...?
Huh?
Ack! NONONO! I'm not thinking of hiring--
Y-Yes!?
Whaaaat!? Why would you think something like that, Your Hon--
I would think that most people wouldn't be able to overlook a person hiring another to kill.
Ah... Yeah... (Well, a change in occupation might be good for you...)
Are you talking about the button and the knife?
(Oh, this card...)
(He's pretty devoted to his work...)
(Hmm... It's really hard to tell if he's being truthful or not without him being here...)
So you're saying most clients wouldn't do such a thing?
Ah, no! I already told you! I have no intention of ever using your services!
(Why does he keep looking at me like I'm the one on trial here!?)
From the very beginning?
(I wonder if that's really true...)
...?
Leads to:
So why do you think your client did that?
Well, fiddling around at the scene of the crime is pretty risky. And why would someone who has requested a murder go to the crime scene anyway?
If that's the case, then why didn't the person just request that you do it...?
Huh?
And that's all you have to testify?
"Again"...? As in you plan to continue?
Excuse me? Ah, no no no! I'm fine! Really!
(I wonder what kind of man the judge thinks I am now...)
All I can do now is expose the lies.
(Nnngh... I'm so confused... But the one thing I know for sure is I can't let this trial end yet!)
Thank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.
When Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your "client" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!
From this wine glass, Your Honor.
Mr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!
That is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!
...!
Yeah, I know...
Mr. Edgeworth! I'm surprised! You know you can't say things like that without any evidence.
(Right now, I have to buy us more time... While we wait for the items De Killer left behind to get here. I just know that the very outcome of this trial lies with those items!)
One week ago? Are you sure?
Please... stop...
(A specific date and time...?)
Did you ask why on that specific night?
(Your suspicions, huh?)
(Even if I ask about them, it would only be a guess.) I see... That's fine then.
So what are these "suspicions" you had? Why did your client request that night...?
The bear...?
(He must be talking about this bear puzzle...)
(I see...)
The testimony just now has made one thing clear. And that is... The "client" knew the secret of the bear figurine!
Huh...? Why is everyone so quiet...?
O-Oh, really?
(What De Killer said sounds plausible, but... In the end, it's just his conjecture...) No, Your Honor. I don't think it's very important.
So you physically met Adrian Andrews, right?
(What was that?? What was with the brief pause...?)
(It's probably just my imagination... I need to find something more definitive to catch this guy on!) Can we believe that your testimony up to this point has been reliable?
Witness! I would like for you to give us a few more details.
Of course, it was very important, Your Honor. If Mr. de Killer had met his client before the murder, then it's unlikely he is mistaken!
Ah... um... I guess so...
(I'm so lost... Who the heck am I supposed to be helping here...?)
Why he meets his clients is not important. And that wasn't the point. Witness, please stop side-stepping my questions!
My question was "Did you really meet Adrian Andrews in person?"
(I was so sure there was something, but I can't get a good grip on what it is...) Hmm, I guess it wasn't all that important.
Y-Yes?
Um...
(Um... I guess I missed something back there...?)
(If I heard what I think I heard just now... Then I think I've got him.) Your Honor. I believe the testimony just now was of the utmost importance.
But as we now know, that was not how it turned out, correct?
Adrian Andrews turned out to be a client who couldn't stick to the rules, right?
Leads to:
So your client was Adrian Andrews...?
(Well, he says the two of them met... But if they did, then there shouldn't be anything wrong with De Killer's testimony...)
(Well, there doesn't seem to be anything strange this time around...)
(Talk about a delicate balance...)
I would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?
And that's when you thought "he" was trustworthy...
I'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.
Shelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!
Because you made one very big slip-up... ...about her.
If you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a woman!
This witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.
(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)
(He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)
I know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK; like we can do this. (As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)
But didn't you just say that you always meet your clients?
But didn't you meet your client this time?
Oh, come now. Let's stop with this game of cat and mouse.
Alright then, just cough it up and confess!
Um...
(We've come this far! I have to try to prove something here!) Very well, I will show you proof.
Here is the proof that the witness met with his client, who wished Mr. Corrida dead!
Leads to:
So! What do you think!?
Oh... That's right, you can't actually see the evidence...
(Argh! How could I have picked the wrong piece at a time like this!?)
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Unfortunately, I don't have any proof.
And why could you not meet certain clients?
(In a contest of mimicry, the judge would beat a parrot, hands down...)
Two or three other things...?
And what were these "other things"?
(What should I do...? Should I let him slide with that...? It'd be really bad if I push his buttons the wrong way and he gets mad...)
(De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.)
Whether or not they're related to this case is for the court to decide.
Y-Yes?
...!
Th-That's...
W-W-Wait! (Uh oh... This is looking really bad! I shouldn't press my luck. Alright, I have to think. Is this worth pursuing...?)
(De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.)
Witness, this is a very important matter. Please cooperate and tell us what these other "jobs" your client requested were...
The bear figurine...?
And... Where was that figurine...?
And then... what did you do next?
You gave it to your "client"... Interesting.
I found this figurine at Mr. Engarde's mansion. If you gave it to Ms. Andrews, then what was it doing there?
(It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!)
(So De Killer says he gave the figurine to Ms. Andrews. But I know somewhere in that statement there is a contradiction... And yet... I know that if I present something trivial here...)
(She's right. So now what, Dr. Wright!?)
(It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!)
Witness, let's go over this one more time. You gave Ms. Andrews the bear figurine. And she told you to take the bear and wait for her at Engarde Mansion. Is that correct?
Well, I think maybe you might have remembered a few things incorrectly.
(This is a battle of wits! I can't let up on him!) I don't think it is possible for Ms. Andrews to have been the recipient of this bear!
Leads to:
So! What do you think!?
Witness!
Mr. de Killer!
...Huh?
!
Urk!
Leads to:
So you're saying that you never saw your client's face. Not even once?
(The Nickel Samurai mask, I'm guessing...?)
One thing does sort of stick out at me, Your Honor. Witness. I think you most definitely saw your client's face.
Let's recall Mr. Powers' testimony.
You received quite a large roll of cash from Mr. Engarde! And at the time, he was not wearing his Nickel Samurai mask!
Huh?
(Oh, the déjà vu... And isn't his salary more than enough for one man...?)
Y-Yes?
Oh, no, it's not like that at all. I just think lies aren't a good thing, you know...?
Urk.
I'm sorry! Please forgive my foolishness!
(I think I can pull something out of what he said... But it would be real bad if I did something and made him mad over something trivial!) There are no problems with the testimony, Your Honor.
Huh? Seems like we're still OK to me.
O-Oh yeah... (All I can do now is pray that those items reach us in time...)
Shelly de Killer. If you had really given the bear to Ms. Andrews... then this item should not have been inside it.
Yup, that's where I'm going...
Your Honor. Please think back to Ms. Andrews' testimony.
If even for a single minute, this bear had actually been in Ms. Andrews' hands... I'm sure she would have taken the suicide note out and burned it!
...!
No! That's not...
W-Wait! Please!
N...No... Please... Not that... Please wait...
Nnnngh... Gnwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
...
(Edgeworth! We can't do this! If we keep this up... Maya... She'll...!)
...!
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
(M-Ms. Andrews... would be charged with murder!)
(I can't believe it...)
...
(Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?)
(But... But if I did that... Maya will die! But if I say he's innocent... Then Ms. Andrews will be charged as the murderer! Do I say he's "guilty"... or "not guilty"...? Either choice I make, someone's life is going to end!)
(It all hinges on what I "choose"!)
...
(I can't! I can't do this! But I have to decide something! I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart!) My client... Matt Engarde is...
... (Maya... I'm sorry...) Matt Engarde is...
F-Franziska von Karma!!
(That's Gumshoe's... I can spot his tattered rags anywhere...)
(I've fought long and hard this whole trial... All for what is inside that raggedy coat... I'm sure that inside that coat, lies a crucial piece of evidence!) Your Honor! Inside that filthy coat... Are the defense's final pieces of evidence!
(Wh-What!?)
...!
(Somewhere among the evidence we're about to see... There will be something that will turn this whole situation around... like a miracle. I'm sure of it!)
(Does De Killer's pistol have anything to do with this case...?)
Does that pistol have any relation to this case?
...?
Oh...
(So that's the pistol that was used to shoot Franziska... It's probably not going to help us very much...)
(I'm pretty sure there was no gun involved in this case. There's no real benefit to hearing about it...) Please present the next piece of evidence.
(I bet De Killer took that from Engarde Mansion...)
Have you checked the contents of that tape?
Oh yeah...
De... De Killer went back for it...?
(Right now, we don't need to establish De Killer's role in this case... I should be listening to information about a different piece of evidence.) That's fine. Please present the next piece of evidence!
(Is that a uniform from the Gatewater Hotel...?)
Was that used during the crime?
(There's no doubt about it! De Killer was wearing this on the night of the murder!)
(I don't think this is going to help us much at all...) Thank you very much, Ms. von Karma. I think that's enough.
And... what is that, Your Honor..?
Wait, Your Honor! Please allow me to examine this new evidence!
(Is this the end...?)
I knew it... There's no such thing as a "miracle" in this world, is there?
But... But... No matter how you think about it... It's... It's...
(T-Two!?)
Huh?
Th-That may be true, but... That's asking me to do the impossible!
Mia! That's even more impossible! He is a man who values his duty towards his clients above all else!
The bigger problem is, the judge has already said he doesn't need any more evidence! The pieces he was just shown; he's not accepting them!
...! (The "other side"...? Wait, does she mean...) You mean... to turn things around?
("The person who needs the evidence"...)
Judge:
I am not saying it is us that needs the evidence, Your Honor!
Yes, Your Honor.
Please, Your Honor!
(O...One chance...)
(I have to try to remember... Everything that has happened up to this point... Think, Phoenix! Think! There must be a way to save Maya while taking Engarde down at the same time!)
...
Leads to:
Leads to:
Judge:
Whaaat!?
W-Wait! Please! One more chance...
(Alright! It looks like they got a hold of him...)
Maya... She's OK, right!?
Yes. One is all I need. I have here a video tape. It was found at your hideout.
I heard you injured three officers in your attempt to get this back.
(I thought so...)
Do you know the contents of this tape?
Actually, you are on this tape.
There was a video camera hidden at the crime scene. Your actions were being recorded.
Well, the only person who could have placed a camera at the scene of the crime... would be your "client" naturally.
Your "client" specified a place and time for you, isn't that right?
That was so they could film you.
...
(Why did Matt Engarde film the crime scene...? The reason "why" he did that is my ticket out of this whole mess!) There is only one reason why your "client" would secretly film the crime scene. They...
They wanted to witness the moment Juan Corrida died! Your client was going to sit on their fluffy soft sofa... Sip some coffee and pretend they were at a film festival!
Well, Your Honor!?
Whaaat!?
W-Wait! Please! One more chance...
Your "client" didn't trust your skills! That's why, in order to monitor your work, they set up a video camera!
Oh... Is that how you feel...? W-Well, everyone...? What do you think...? Pretty good, huh...?
Whaaat!?
W-Wait! Please! One more chance...
Your "client" once told me something very interesting. We were talking about you, and this is what they said.
Your "client" didn't trust you at all. They were thinking of using this video to blackmail you! What do you have to say to that, Shelly de Killer!?
Yes... By a natural... That is the kind of person they are. Your "client" is a person who only thinks and plots of how to use the people around them to protect themselves from any and all dangers that may arise. That is the true nature of your "client".
(So the traitor becomes De Killer's next target... Ah! I get it... This is how we'll turn this case around!)
Yes...?
(Maya... I thought I'd never see you again... Oh thank goodness!)
Mr. Engarde. It looks like somehow, you got what you wanted. You will finally receive the acquittal you wanted so badly. You should be happy.
...!
Right, Chief.
Congratulations, Mr. Matt Engarde.
Please make sure to savor every moment of what little time you have left. Your Honor! As always, the defense pleads not guilty.
...Matt Engarde.
Even though I am a lawyer, I cannot make your crime disappear. I think a guilty verdict is appropriate here.
Even if you got an acquittal, the instant you set foot outside the detention center, your life would be in danger. No matter which way you look at it... You can't run away from your crime anymore!
(We? I don't remember you helping out much in this...)
(She must be talking about the time Edgeworth really went after her... I guess she's trying to forgive him for what he did...)
(Wow, this is the first time I've ever seen her smile.)
What I did out there was right... wasn't it?
Yes, I understand now.
... (I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart! Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?) My client... Matt Engarde is...
E-Edgeworth...
P-Pearls--
(Oww... She punches deceptively hard for a kid...)
Ah, um... Thanks.
What's wrong?
Um... About earlier... Uh... Thanks... OWW!!
... I don't think you'll ever understand... Ms. von Karma.
E-Edgeworth...?
...
(You really let me down...) When you disappeared, I felt... betrayed. The reason I decided to become a lawyer to begin with... Was because I believed in the things you said to me, all those years ago... And you... You betrayed your own words. That's why... one year ago, I made up my mind. I decided that the Miles Edgeworth I knew had died... ...At least, that's what I told myself.
(Franziska threw something on the ground just now...)
Isn't that the thing she used to track Detective Gumshoe...?
...
... Umm... OK.
......! M-M-M... MAYA!
Well, of course I did! You know I would never desert you! But we sure pressed our luck this trial... You're really lucky to be standing here!
... (Is it really that easy to do something like that...?)
Um... Don't mention it.
Huh? Where are we going!?
Y-You think I look like a burger...? I'm a Prime Rib at least!
Alright... So how about we hit up our usual burger joint...?
Huh?
A-Another feast...?
Gumshoe! Are you alright!?
A telephone pole...? (Then, it wasn't a red light that got him...?)
Th-Thanks...
(Looks like Lotta bought herself a new camera...)
(There was a fourth item...?)
(Why does she look so happy about that...?)
(Ah... It sure is nice to finally see them both smiling again.)
What is it, Edgeworth?
(And you've eaten way too much, you glutton!)
Wait.
... I just want to say... Thanks, Edgeworth. You really saved me out there.
(I feel like words alone aren't enough here... I wonder if there's anything I can give him to express how I feel...?)
Thank you... It's all thanks to you two. You... and her...
Um... It's my way of saying thanks...
(Hmm... I guess I'm not very good at this showing my appreciation thing...)
Huh?
Huh? Huh?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
... (Why do I suddenly feel like screaming?)
... Alright then... If you say so.

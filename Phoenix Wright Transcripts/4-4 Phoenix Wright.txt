Ah, you are here. Working hard or hardly working? Hey! How have you been?
Ah ha ha, how goes it, Trucy? Here, I got a present for you.
Well, I'm beat.
Ah ha ha. How right you are.
...... Maybe it is time. It has something to do with you, anyway.
Ah ha ha! To be honest... ...telling you about the mission was my whole reason for coming here today.
Tell me... ...you've heard of the Jurist System, yes?
That's right. The new legal system everyone's talking about.
...... Maybe not as many people are talking about it as I thought.
Ah, those legal books were left by my mentor. Too bad I gave up the practice before reading them.
Ah ha ha. Those would be Trucy's. She'll remember they're there eventually, I'm sure.
...The plant. It intrigues you, doesn't it?
Ah ha ha. No, no secrets. But lots of memories. And a name, too. Want to hear it?
His name... is Charley. If you were curious.
Well, Trucy, do you know what a "jury" is?
Well, they're thinking about reviving that system. They're calling the new system, the "Jurist System".
Not quite that harsh. The jurists cooperate with the judge. They help analyze the case from different angles.
Their findings directly affect the verdict. Hopefully, people will start taking the courts a little more seriously now.
Dr. Wright, his assistant Trucy... ...and mascot Apollo. The perfect team!
The Jurist System is my mission... more or less. Anyway, keep in mind that new ideas like this system are always risky, Apollo.
In any case... ...we're going to give it a shot. A test, if you will.
We'll take a case as a sample, and choose six jurists. I'll be the one helping with that process, incidentally.
Well, for one, I'll be chair of the Jurist System Simulated Court Committee. The chair constructs the ideal situation... choosing the case, the jurist candidates... ...even the judge and the courtroom.
...I was never that good at the piano, to be honest.
The trial's tomorrow, by the way. Don't miss it. The trial simulation that is.
Why not go with her?
Oh, don't worry about that. You'll hear all about it tomorrow, regardless.
Ah, "presenting", are we? I did my fair share of that back in the day. Showed my attorney's badge a lot, too.
Ah ha ha. You know me too well, Trucy.
Ahem. I wasn't finished talking to you, you know. Or rather, you weren't finished asking me questions.
Well, since it is the first run through of a new system, I wanted something simple.
True. The case is a murder.
...Guilty. Yes. Most likely. ...So, good luck, Apollo.
With the trial tomorrow. You're defending, of course. Recall that I said it had something to do with you.
...And a potentially serious sentence. The most serious, in a worst-case scenario.
All the forms have been filed. There's no turning back now. The trial begins tomorrow at 10 AM. Hope you can make room in your schedule.
...Ah, yes. There was a change this morning. ...I picked a new case.
...Something that happened last night.
You really want to know don't you?
If all goes well, then yes. Of course, this is just a test. We wanted everyone to start without preconceptions. A blank slate, as it were.
Well mine. Committee chair, remember?
Well, if you want to know that badly, I suppose... ...I could give you permission to examine the scene of the crime.
...But you can't talk to anyone involved with the case.
You let me worry about the details, there. Remember... I'm in charge of this trial. All of it.
Apollo... ...if I am in charge of the whole trial... ...that means the entire affair is my responsibility. For good, or for bad.
Just do what you can. And don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
I'd recommend going down to the detention center. Your client's waiting for you. You can ask about the scene there.
...Oh, you can talk to your client. If... you can get her to talk.
Ah, "Gramarye", that reminds me...
Consider it a birthday present, Trucy.
...Hmm. Good point. ...What day is it today, Apollo?
Then, it's a Recycle-Your-Plastics present.
...No.
You'll need that envelope someday. Someday soon. Don't open it until then.
That was how we first met. ...Seven years ago.
(Whew, OK. It's been a long time since I've felt like such a rookie. Got to try and relax.) Ah, good morning, Mr. Enigmar.
I received the files from your previous attorney only yesterday. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure I'm prepared.
Yes, well, you haven't really told me what happened yet! All we did... was play cards.
(Actually, it wasn't. Trust me.)
(That's "young man" to you.) Good morning. That's a cute outfit you have on.
Oh, I'm sure it is! (What the heck is she talking about?)
Huh? Me? (Look what he's started.)
What's this...?
Hmm... Not from the looks of it. (What is this? Looks like a page from someone's diary.) I'll give it a read later.
We'll get through it. Somehow. Incidentally... the prosecutor today is a new guy, I hear.
They're calling him a "true thoroughbred in the history of the prosecutor's office". ...Of course, there's one of those every year.
...Yes?
(First time a defendant's ever given me a pep speech...) I'll do what I can.
I-Impossible?
(My first look at the case was only yesterday. And the information I was given was a tad bit lacking, to be honest. Still, I'll do what I can. ...For their sake.)
My client is Shadi Enigmar. Known to the world as Zak Gramarye. A wildly popular magician, star of Troupe Gramarye. His mentor, Magnifi Gramarye, was a rare breed of magician. He single-handedly ushered in a golden age of stage magic... until he was shot dead. And Zak Gramarye is the suspect.
Each attorney's badge has a number engraved on the back. No two numbers are the same. So if you drop it, people will know it was you. Better make sure I don't lose mine.
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Klavier Gavin... Lead singer for the megahit band, the Gavinners. You're out of your league, rock-boy.)
......
...Talkative, aren't you? I like your affected Euro-rock accent, by the way.
(Detective Gumshoe... Long time no see.)
H-Huh? Me?
(What, you normally lack confidence in your testimony...?)
(I wouldn't have put it quite so lyrically, but it's true. Why make the effort to commit murder when the victim was about to die?)
Diabetes?
...I always hated getting shots. I guess Magnifi was giving himself the insulin shots... There's no way I could do that... *shudder* ...! Wait! If Magnifi used this to inject his insulin... ...why are there no traces of it having been used? Hmm... Something to keep in mind.
One thing bothers me about this. Why didn't he just say "11"? Why have him come at "11:05" without some specific reason...?
An IV...?
So that was the only time they could meet without the chance of an untimely interruption. ...During his IV.
(What's this "reason he couldn't refuse", I wonder? He could have at least mentioned it to me...)

Just because he got the letter doesn't mean he went through with it!
It could be a set-up. But let's not be in such a hurry. Maybe we should let the witness talk for a change.

...And this letter was sent by the victim?
...Huh?
Ah, I see...
(I didn't "lose". I was just ascertaining the facts. ...So why am I so annoyed?)
I'm not sure this is exactly "commonplace", even now, Your Honor.

...How can you be so sure!?
(You fail to grasp the concept of "questioning", detective.)
I can see that. But I still wouldn't do it.
(You fail to grasp the concept of "shooting people is bad", detective.)
(The photo... Maybe there's something in there I can use. So they're saying the defendant "shot the victim in the forehead"? I think there's a hole in the prosecution's argument! Clearly, Mr. Enigmar...)
Unfortunately, nothing in this picture suggests he didn't do it.
...Huh?
...Huh?
(...Everyone's so eager to move on. So of course, I want to slow down. ...Is there really not a single clue in this picture?)
People don't normally commit murder just because their teacher told them to. Which means the defendant didn't fire that pistol!
Um, well, yes.
...Ah.
...... ......
(But it's a cold sweat, Your Honor...)
Looking at this photo, another possibility occurs to me.
What does the letter tell us? That the defendant had a "reason he couldn't refuse" his teacher's wishes.
Oh? The defense disagrees. You see, the defendant had another choice he could make.
...I can prove he had a choice, yes.


...Urk!
(Ugh. Time to think this one through again.)
Take a closer look. See? It's been shot in the forehead, too.
Yes, and a hole in the prosecution's claim!
He didn't just shoot the doll. He shot the doll's forehead.
Let's read the "orders" once more, shall we? "...You will shoot, one shot, square in the forehead." ...Which is exactly what he did. He shot the clown doll square in the forehead!

Perhaps he did have to shoot a forehead, as ordered. But the letter says nothing about whose forehead... This was the only way he had to follow his orders without taking a life!
(...How sad it is to see the novice's overconfidence. He doesn't realize just how big this little "hole" is going to get.)

But... it might have been the clown's forehead he shot.
He "practiced" in the middle of the hospital? Anyone could have come in at any moment!
(Patience. We'll get there sooner than you think.)

You mean this pistol, the one in the crime scene photo?
So... you verified the murder weapon, in other words.
So... were any fingerprints found on the gun?
Whoa whoa whoa! Not well made! Not intriguing!

...Why are you so certain?
Huh? What's that?
(You know, that would explain a lot about the police force.)
So... were any fingerprints found on the gun?
Whoa whoa whoa! Not well made! Not intriguing!

So let me get this straight. You're saying my client first shot the clown, then shot the victim?
(More of a confirmation than a summary, but whatever.)
(Do these people ever miss a chance to mock me?)

(...I didn't have time to gather all the details before coming in here. This testimony might be my only source of information. Better pay attention... and read this letter carefully.)
If you look closely, you can see how the pistol's made to bend here. It's a one-shot model, and I guess this bend is where you load it. So... this is the famous Gramarye Golden Sun. They say kids used to love pretending they had one of those. I wonder if they pretended to miss their targets, too?
The trickiest cases often seem the simplest. Prosecutor Gavin, you missed the bullet hole in the clown's forehead. If you hadn't missed that, you might have come to a very different conclusion. ...Understand?

...Did nothing of the sort to the victim. The pistol proves he could not.
It's quite simple, Your Honor. This pistol only holds one bullet at a time.
If he had shot the clown in the forehead... ...he couldn't have shot the victim, too!

Oh? Where did he get the extra bullet? They're not so easy to come by, you know. If you claim the defendant "had one ready"... ...then prove to us how he got it!
(And utter lack of humility.)
...Ready for what?
(This might be my lucky break... I'll need that 15 minutes to talk to my client... Zak.)
...We've only just begun. I was hoping you could tell me a bit more about what happened, actually.
I think we need less thinking and more talking! That night in the hospital... What really happened?
(Speaking of which, where is she?)
The "one shot in the forehead" one, right?
Why not...?
(What's this "for now" business?)
..."We"?
(Finally... This guy sure likes to take his time getting to the important stuff.)
..."Two"?
Oh, for the "Zak & Valant's Quick-Draw" thing?
You "faltered"...? You mean you thought about shooting him?
So... there were other requests you "couldn't refuse" before?
(Was Magnifi coercing his disciples somehow? Just what was going on in Troupe Gramarye...?)
In your pocket?
"Rifling marks".
"Concerning the case"...? You mean, there's something else you can tell me?
...Thanks?
What!? Magnifi Gramarye...?
What did you talk about...?
(Zak Gramarye... He seems pretty steadfast to me... or maybe just stubborn.)
...Right. Let's get back in there.
Your "decisive witness"? How many times have I heard those words... ...though they often turn out to be far less decisive than you think.
(Valant Gramarye... So, we get to meet the Great Magnifi's other disciple!)
W-Wait! The shooting took place in that hospital after 11 o'clock at night! If you're a "witness", does that mean you were there that late?
Um... OK. (I always get the characters, don't I?)
W-Wait... That's the same letter Zak Gramarye received!
(By which you mean you're not going to tell us. ...Which makes me wonder even more about this "reason they couldn't refuse".)
Fascinating. Though, I hardly need to remind you... ...that the evidence could just as clearly point to you as the suspect. The letter, the murder weapon... ...and now, the two bullets found at the scene.
Let's not jump to any conclusions!
(And if it wasn't Zak Gramarye, then the killer was you, Valant! And no disappearing act will get you out of that.)

...Which, according to the letter, was 11:20 PM?
...Right.

So... you weren't worried for your own safety at all? I mean, you smelled gunpowder, yes? What if the shooter was still nearby?
...Uh, really? (Isn't magic all about illusions and imagination?) How about this: you were the shooter, which is why you weren't afraid.

Which brings us back to this "reason" neither of you could refuse.
But Magnifi wrote the same thing to you. Why could you "refuse" if Zak couldn't?
(...So which is it!?)

There were two bullet holes at the scene: one in the victim, and one in the clown. You're saying the one who shot the clown... was you?
(Yeah, because whoever didn't shoot the clown committed murder. I'd better dig around here a bit more... and see what I turn up.) Mr. Valant... Let me ask about something else concerning the crime scene, namely...
In order to shoot a pistol, you need a bullet. Where was the bullet?
Prepared for...?
Without a loaded bullet, we wouldn't have a murder. It's very important, Your Honor.
...Actually, let me ask about something else.
Where exactly was the pistol when you entered the room?
Without a murder weapon, there would be no murder! It's very important, Your Honor.
...Actually, let me ask about something else.
How many pistols were there when you entered the room?
Two pistols were used in the "Zak & Valant Quick-Draw Shootem", correct? One for each of you.
(What did Zak tell me back in the lobby...?)
...... So you picked up that pistol and fired it?
...Actually, let me ask about something else.
The number of pistols is quite important, Your Honor.

If the pistol was already loaded, something doesn't make sense. Why weren't the victim's fingerprints on it?
(Can't really do much with fingerprints that weren't there. Maybe I should ask about something else?)
(...On second thought, let's run with this testimony for a while longer.)

Why did you do that? I would think calling the police would come first.
So, you're going to die?
(...Perhaps I'm totally confused. Maybe I should ask about something else?)
(...On second thought, let's run with this testimony for a while longer.)

So you took the only pistol there, and fired it?
And that pistol was this one, which was left at the crime scene?
(And you're an idiot of sorts... Do you have any idea what you just said...?)
(Hmm... I've got a hunch, but maybe that's all it is. Maybe I should ask about something else?)
(...On second thought, let's run with this testimony for a while longer.)


So you informed the police... What did you do then?
I don't know, that's why I'm asking. Now please answer the question and skip the sarcasm.
(Both of Magnifi's students received the same letter. Both admit to having gone to the hospital that night. Two bullets were fired... and one of them killed Magnifi! Time to find the cracks in his testimony...)
According to the defendant, Zak Gramarye, when he entered the room... ...there were two pistols on that table.
One of those pistols he used to shoot the clown in the forehead. Then he left with it in his pocket.
...Well, what about what Mr. Valant has told us? You see, there's something about his testimony that doesn't make sense.
That's your story, at least.
But the rifling marks tell a very different story, Mr. Valant. Recall what Prosecutor Gavin told us!
Mr. Valant, if you fired this pistol... ...then YOU shot the victim in the forehead!
S-Sorry for what!?

But... But that's not what you told us before! You said you'd verified the murder weapon!
That was just this morning!
...!
...!
(...Bring it.)
(Their debut single was only 2 minutes and 15 seconds long? What a rip-off!)
(Carry on... Right.)

11:20 PM... Can you prove that's when you arrived?
(Hmm... Does that all make sense?)
I don't see any problem with that testimony.
...The only problem I see here is the glaring contradiction in that testimony?
...... I guess it was?
(...Ugh...)

You walk in on a murder, and the first thing you do is shoot the clown?
Yes, Your Honor. (What a pain this is turning out to be...)

Did the doctor say anything concerning the cause of death?
(What ever happened to good old-fashioned investigation?)
Yes, Your Honor. (What a pain this is turning out to be...)

I don't think I'm stepping out on a limb to say I have some doubts about this. How could the doctor be so precise with the time?
Ah! You could just measure the remaining IV liquid...
(Hmm. Did that seem important?)
I don't see any problem with that testimony.
Well, seeing how it is the biggest clue we have to the time of death... ...I'd say it's very important.

And he knew this by the amount of IV liquid left?
(If I left this "alibi" go through... ...I'm finished. There has to be a hole in this somewhere. Heck, I'll take a pinprick.)

Did you notice the IV yourself, by any chance?
Your... lucky color?
(*groan* This is one trip down memory lane no one needs.)
(...Valant sure looks happy with himself. ...OK, how about this "lucky color" testimony?)
I don't see any problem with that testimony.
It certainly sounds like your lucky color's brought you plenty of luck. But not this time. Mr. Valant... your lucky color's betrayed you.
...Your Honor! The witness's testimony just now clearly contradicts the evidence!
(...Don't worry, I've got all your bases right here.)


Well, I don't know whether it's the sort of evidence to "do it" for anyone but...
...!
(Darn... I was so close on that one.)

You entered that hospital room at 11:20 PM. The time given by the defendant, Zak Gramarye, was 11:05 PM. ...You didn't run into him at the hospital that night?
Huh...?
...... The mood isn't in question here.
(For what is magic, if not the study of how to make absolutely no sense at all? That said... was there a contradiction in there?)
I don't see any problem with that testimony.
...The only problem I see here is the glaring contradiction in that testimony?
...... I guess it was?
(...Ugh...)
(An alibi over a matter of minutes. Precise is right! Hmm. And pressing with impunity will earn me a nice penalty, too. Better focus on one thing... this "time of death".)
...The crime scene tells all, Your Honor.
...My pleasure. And, I assure you, it's quite simple. ...But I can't promise anything in black and white.


Um... how's that?
(...Ugh. Thank you sir, may I have another... Valant's "lucky color" is the color of his clothes, right? What contradicts that?)
...Valant Gramarye! Let's get one thing straight about your "lucky color". ...It's "yellow", yes?
Yes, there is. Decisively wrong, in fact. Take another look at the photo of the crime scene.
...It would be hard to call the IV liquid "yellow". And I'm afraid, no magic was involved in the taking of this photograph.
(The greener they are, the harder they fall... I suppose there's no substitute for experience.) Valant Gramarye, as you reminded us several times... ...your lucky color is yellow. But the IV is clearly not.
This contradiction can mean only one thing!
...?
How do you mean...?
The bag? You mean the plastic bag on the hook?
...You get green.

As I thought... There's no substitute for experience, Prosecutor Gavin.
You may tell a good tale. But. You've just proven something rather grave. For you, that is.
The liquid in the IV is yellow, yes. ...But how did this witness know that?
It's quite unnatural when you think about it. You... did think about it, didn't you?
Your Honor! The defense requests an explanation from the witness! At the scene of the crime, the IV liquid appears to be green! ...So let me ask! How did the witness know the IV liquid was actually yellow!?
...I can think of only one possibility, Your Honor. The witness, Valant Gramarye... ...has testified that the IV liquid was yellow because...
There was a reason the IV liquid looked yellow to the witness! ...I bet!
...... Perhaps. Yes. Definitely.
One more chance, please... (*sigh*)
...From the facts before us, the answer is clear. The witness knew that the IV liquid was yellow. ...Why? Because he'd seen it before. But not inside the blue bag we see in the photo. He saw the liquid by itself, in a clear, colorless bag.
Ask yourself, why would he know, if he didn't work at a hospital? ...That's where you'll find your meaning, Your Honor.

The IV liquid is the only evidence "proving" the time of death. A 30-minute hourglass, with 20 minutes worth of sand remaining. Your claim, Prosecutor Gavin.
However... ...there's a critical difference between an hourglass and an IV bag.
As much as it pains me to say this, Your Honor, no. Unlike the sands through an hourglass, IV liquid enters the patient's body. At which point, like magic, it disappears. However! What if the amount of IV liquid had increased? You couldn't tell, could you? After all, there's no way of knowing how much went in.
Not with water... but with IV liquid. That's how you knew the IV liquid was yellow!

I'm an amateur, too, but I can pour water into a cup.
(You don't need to be an expert to see the look on the witness's face! He added liquid to that IV to throw off the time of death!)
...Valant Gramarye. I'm afraid your "magic" won't serve you well in a life of crime.
...Magic relies on props. And props... become evidence. Our witness was certainly able to increase the amount of IV liquid in the bag. All he had to do was work a little magic. And the prop was...


...Urk.
...Unnk.
(That didn't go so well. I wonder if there was something at the scene... Something he could have used to add more IV liquid.)
...It's the perfect prop for the "Magically Increasing IV" trick! And easy enough for an amateur to use.

And don't you find that odd, Prosecutor Gavin?
The victim had the syringe to administer his insulin shots... ...There should have been traces of insulin left inside!
Well, Valant Gramarye? As you pointed out yourself, the IV liquid makes the perfect clock... ...one that you could manipulate at will!
Valant used this to manipulate the time of death, washed it, and left the scene. ...Which is why it shows no signs of use.
(Well. Maybe I can squeeze an extra day out of this... I can do a little much-needed investigation work.)
...!
...? (What's he talking about?)
There's no proof he didn't do it, either.
(Huh? He's admitting it?)
Diary...?
Wait... That book doesn't say what the reason was, does it? The reason why his disciples couldn't refuse his last request?
......
...... (He's right about the diary being pretty clear. Still I find it hard to believe... ...that he'd overlook such an obvious problem with his precious evidence!)
(...If the diary is accepted like this, the trial's over. Hmm. Maybe it's time for me to show them something.)
(I don't like anything about this situation... ...But the judge is already getting twitchy with his gavel. So I'd better show them something quick... or else.)
I'm left with no choice but to show my own evidence.
...!
...Alright. I'd be happy to. The decisive evidence proving that the diary didn't end with this page is...


......
(Time to get cozy with the Court Record... I know I've got the evidence in here somewhere.)
First... take a close look at this diary. ...Note that a page has clearly been ripped out!
(That's why we're still here talking about this...) As it just so happens... ...I have here what I believe to be the missing page.
Looking at this page... It's hard to imagine that the first visitor that night shot Magnifi Gramarye. That's the defense's position.
Note the torn edge of the page. It's a perfect match with the torn remains of the last page in Magnifi's diary!
The diary continued after his first visitor came. Which means that the victim was still alive after Zak Gramarye left! Leaving no one to take his life but the second visitor! Valant Gramarye!
...Resist what? Presenting solid evidence?
...... Well, Your Honor. Judging from his enthusiasm... ...we'll have to hear this new testimony sooner or later anyway. ...So it might as well be sooner.
(...I had a bad feeling just then. That ripped-out page was too obvious... ...He must have known. And I should've known it was a bad sign all around...)
A judiciary "deal"...?
......
...How's that possible? Have you seen this diary page somewhere before?
You... what? You "made" it!?
F-Forgeries...!?

Hold it! I didn't "prepare" this evidence!
What...!?

B-But...! There's no proof this is a fake!
Huh...
(...It was careless of me. ...That's all I can say.)
What's this...?
(It was all a trap. A fatal trap...)
Yes.
If I did, would the court hear it?
...!

...Your Honor, wait! I understand that presenting forged evidence in court is a serious crime. But you cannot hold my client responsible for actions I undertook as an individual...
...Your Honor?
......
Yes?
...? Phoenix Wright...
M-Mr. Enigmar!!!

The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track...?)

Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Huh? Really?
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)

This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)

Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
I, Phoenix Wright, will be your guide through this game. That terrible trial saw me present forged evidence. ...It ended, half-finished, when the defendant vanished. What became of me after that...? As your investigation proceeds the answer will become clear. ...Oh, and one more thing. There is something I must tell you. As Apollo Justice has his bracelet... ...so, too, do I have my own "weapon" of sorts. ...My Magatama. What does it do, you ask? That I would have you see for yourself. ...Well
The nightmare trial was over... ...and the new nightmare of figuring out what had happened had just begun. I wanted to wake up, to walk away. ...But I figured I'm the only one who could do this, probably. And besides, I had plenty of time. Thanks to the Bar Association review board's decision. It's hard to work when your attorney's badge has been taken away.
(That's "young man" to you.) Good morning. That's a cute outfit you have on.
...Two weeks had passed since then. I called her into my office.
Trucy, there's something we need to talk about.
It's been two weeks since your father... disappeared. We need to start thinking about... your future.
I, um, did some calling around. This is hard to say, but... ...you have no living relatives.
So... ...I was wondering if you wanted to stay with me for a while. Just until your daddy comes home. It won't be long. (...I hope.)
Uh, of course, it's totally your choice. If you don't like it here, you can go wherever you'd like. I could look up some places you might like to stay at... (This is so weird...)
Huh...? Really?
Huh? Uh... Um... I guess so? (Getting weirder...)
Er, actually, why don't you call me... Nick. ...Or you can call me "Daddy" if you'd like. It doesn't have to be today, or anything.
(That was quick.) ...Yes?
...Ah.
...Ah.
Trucy... how old are you?
...Ah, thanks. (Why does it feel like she's already in charge...?)
Quite the collection of law books. My mentor bought all of them. I used to be too busy to read them. Now that I have the time to read them, there's no need. ...But I can't just sell them. Maybe Trucy will want to read them someday?
(...Nah.)
My mentor's favorite plant, Charley. I guess watering Charley's my only real job now. ...... Wait! I have a child now! I can't feed Trucy like this! She probably needs more than the occasional watering, too, I'm guessing.
An old movie poster hangs on the wall. I finally found out the title after not knowing for the longest time. I actually rented the movie the other day. Cried my eyes out. ...... Ack! Just thinking about it makes me tear up... Wait, it's just allergies... Really! ...I should show it to her when she's a little older. ...... (Wait... what was it called again...?)
My desk. Not that I have any reason to sit there anymore. I guess Trucy can use it. It's great for studying math, English, geography, magic... ...Ack! I'm not crying. I just got some dust in my eye.
You can still see that hotel from the window here. Every time I look out, I think back on those old cases... ...I wonder if the view looks different now that I'm not wearing my old badge...
...Thanks. (She must have learned a lot of words from her parents.)
You could at least kind of look aside or something when you say that. It's... actually kind of hard for me... For Daddy.
Uh... Actually, that's pretty accurate.
Well that won't do, I guess. I just don't know much about anything other than law. (Or even much about law, if you were to ask some people.)
You mean... like a talent agency? Forgive me for asking, but doesn't that require "talent"?
A professional...?
Directly descended... He's your father.
(I think an eight-year-old just massaged my ego.)
Could you tell me a bit more about your daddy... er, Zak Gramarye?
(Which Daddy was that again?)
The Gramaryes... They were on television a lot. (Haven't seen them on much recently, come ot think of it.)
Let me guess, there was a giant fisherman waiting for him at the top?
(Ack! I shouldn't have brought it up so soon...)
Mommy...? (Yeah, what about Mommy? I haven't heard anything about Trucy's mother!)
(I wonder if she'll talk about her mother...?)
So Trucy... You're... a "professional"?
They say that?
What was?
...Right. So, in conclusion... ...you're a professional magician, Trucy?
You're... going to do a magic trick?
Thanks, but maybe next time.
(The tricks can wait. We've got more important things to discuss.)
...... (Was that... mind reading?)
(If that wasn't a magic trick, I wonder what the real ones are like!)
Actually, I would like to see your trick. The future of the "agency" depends on it, after all.
Yeeeeeeeeargh! Whoa... that was... startling.
He... certainly makes an impression.
(...My friendly neighborhood Mr. Hat nearly gave me a heart attack.)
Could you tell me about your mommy... if it's OK?
On stage... You mean, with your daddy?
Went away?
...Maybe so.
This... is your mother? (She's beautiful...)
(Poor girl. I didn't know her mommy had gone missing. And now her daddy's vanished, too, right before her eyes.)
Don't worry. I won't vanish, I promise.
(...I guess all I rate as is a "backup plan".)
Trucy, about this locket...
I do, actually.
...... Oh, that's not how I meant it, honest. (She is beautiful, though. And something more... Poise, that's it. She's got poise.)
Hey, Trucy, see this?
Huh...?
W-What?
(I'll be sure to be careful when showing evidence to magicians in the future...)
...So this is Trucy's mother, Thalassa. She's pretty. I can picture her on stage with Zak. Still, she looks like a down-to-earth type, too. I guess Trucy takes after her.
I think that's probably enough for today. Sorry to ask you so much all at once like that.
Wh-What!? B-But are we... representing anyone?
I think you need more than that to make an agency. Besides... ...you may be a magician... but I'm no talent!
Well, when you put it that way...
OK, OK! I'll think of something.
The team... right.
Sometimes when magicians vanish, they leave something behind... That's how Trucy became Trucy Wright... my daughter. To be honest, I was pretty lost those first few days. Thinking back on it, it was a pretty dark time in my life. But Trucy... happy, smiling Trucy... she was my light.
...Didn't think I'd be back here for a while. I didn't want to have to remember that day.
M-Mr. Enigmar!!!
(When I came here on that fateful morning, I still had my badge. But now... Like an amputated limb... I can still feel it itching. Where do I start? I don't even have the authority to investigate...)
Wh-Wh-What's the big idea!? My ears...!
...... But that would mean all unauthorized personnel are allowed.
...... We've... met before, haven't we? On a case... two years ago?
...Huh?
OK, OK! You're... the bailiff, right?
Um... I've asked to meet with the bailiff at this court who let the magician escape.
B-But... you were a regular police officer once... right?
(Something tells me it's a long story. Let's not go there.) So, you were in charge of security at the time of the "vanishing"...?
(Guess I wasn't the only "victim"...)
I guess this door was officially a prop in Zak Gramarye's last "show". He passed through that lobby door and vanished... but to where? He choreographed that entire fateful trial according to his grand scenario... ...... I hate magicians.
I actually took a nap on that couch once when I was still practicing law. ...Boy, was that a mistake. I never even sit on the lobby sofas now. I never let my clients sit on them, either. It's bad luck.
You know, I think this was the lobby I used for my very first case. This plant has seen me grow from a rookie, to an ace... to a has-been. I hate you, plant. ...Just kidding.
I must have seen that painting a thousand times, but I never really looked at it until now. I guess my head was too stuck in the trials... ...I never had time to stop and appreciate art. I have time now. OK. Let's appreciate. ...... Actually, it's pretty lame.
The last time we met, you were a police officer, right? ...In fact, you're still wearing your uniform.
...That takes real talent, actually. They don't know what they're missing.
But, your uniform...
(That can't be legal.) So... you were the one who let the magician get away that day?
Is there anything you can tell me about it? ...About Zak Gramarye's "disappearance"?
...That's enough of that.
So... you saw someone suspicious coming your way.
I have a diagram of the court building here...
OK... And which way did Zak Gramarye run after bursting through the courtroom door?
You ran into this room...? (Hmm. I don't see any place to hide in here...)
...... That's impossible.
O-OK, I won't say it again, promise! But, you have to admit, it's impo... er... difficult to vanish into thin air! Did you search the lobby?
...... (Why the pause...?)
(How can he talk so loud and still be hiding something...?)
So Zak was in this room when he "vanished"...
(Silk hat, cape... That's Zak alright.)
...... What about now? Have any ideas?
You've had quite a bit of time since then. Has nothing occurred to you at all? Do you have any idea what trick he might have used to disappear like that?
(Psyche-Locks! I should have known... My Magatama... one of my most prized possessions, which I got during a certain case... It can show me the locks on people's hearts. And if I can unlock their hearts... ...they'll tell me their secrets! The Magatama starts it all. And the Magatama ends it!)
Any thoughts on this, Mr. Meekins?
Ow. There's no need to shout, really. ...So, no opinion?
(But I thought... oh, never mind.)
...OK, Mr. Meekins. What do you know? Spit it out.
You know something, and I'm going to find out what. Zak Gramarye vanished from this room... How'd he do it?
Why are you so nervous if you aren't hiding something...?
...What did you just say?
No, you screamed it through that megaphone of yours. ...There was someone else in the room, wasn't there?
(It's OK, Meekins. You don't have to tell me who Zak's accomplice was.) I know who was here in this room that day.


...Well?
...Huh?
(...I wish he'd invoke his right to remain silent now. Still, his little outburst back there should be enough to go on... "What could such a little girl possibly do", was it?)
...... Mr. Meekins. I'm not buying it.
You mean... you chased her into this room, not him?
(Seven feet? Zak isn't that tall, is he?) You have a point... ...I find it hard to imagine that anyone would mistake a little girl for Zak Gramarye. But, you saw something... ...and therein lies the trick. I think you know what it was, Mr. Meekins! Tell me, does this trick look familiar!?


Your your your what?
...It hardly qualifies as a "trick".
(Well, I think I put my foot into that one.)
That girl's favorite trick, "The Amazing Mr. Hat". She uses it in her show down at the Wonder Bar.
Have you been to the Wonder Bar?
C-Come again?
So... Trucy was his accomplice.
Mr. Hat.
(A dream that lasted a week!?)
Though it seems complex, what really happened that day was quite simple. You were standing by the door, and out came Zak. ...But that wasn't all. Another person got in on the act... and she was standing in front of Lobby No. 2. Along with Mr. Hat.
So... ...while you are standing in shock and amazement, the magician rounds the corner... ...and, most likely, runs through the closest door... into Lobby No. 1. This is where you come in. You turn the corner, in rather lukewarm pursuit... ...and at that very moment, Trucy runs into Lobby No. 2! Then, all she has to do is tuck away the Amazing Mr. Hat.
(Such sweet sorrows...)
...I'm sorry. I had no idea how much you'd suffered on account of this case.
Actually, about that girl... ...I'm sort of her guardian now.
Um, OK...
...Erm, Mr. Meekins. This is a free ticket to the show at the Wonder Bar. If you want...
I look forward to it.
All eyes were on Zak Gramarye that day in court... until his mysterious disappearance. Now part of the mystery's been revealed... but the magician remained out of sight. It would be seven years before I met him again...
...Then I guess I'll go back to my piano.
(*sigh*... Two hours left on my shift. Wonder if we'll get any "customers" tonight.)
"Who I Am"? No... But if you hum it, I can play it! ...Just kidding, I don't do requests.
Oh... a customer. I was just hoping someone would come in and save me from a night at the keys.
...And this is? A friend of yours?
The Wright Talent Agency represents two artists. And I'm number two. I play piano... Well, sort of. It's actually just a front for my real talent... ...which is playing poker. Don't ask me how I got started. I don't remember. But I'm good. Real good. It didn't take long for the rumors to get around... "Go to the Borscht Bowl Club if you want a real game. That guy's never lost"... People don't come to hear me tickle the ivory. They come to watch me play cards. Is this a seedy poker club? No.
Then, let's compete. I'll take you to the room.
...Yes?
Oh. I'm...
Huh...?
Have we... met? (Ah...!)
M-Mr. Enigmar!!!
Y-You can't be... But you're...! ...Zak Gramarye!?
(Zak Gramarye!? This must be a bad dream. In a sense, this guy ruined my life.)
Are you really him? The Zak Gramarye?
...How many years has it been now? Six?
Yeah, you could say that.
She's fine. I've got her working already. Hope you don't mind.
...By which you mean poker? (Those eyes! He's serious...)
(I know this guy's type... and they're dangerous. Everything's about the competition. All else is secondary.)
I usually drink too much and it ends up making me thirsty.
Huh...? It's my business card.
(I sure felt surprised. Maybe I had my poker face on.)
I'd do anything else if I could, believe me. Oh yeah, there's something you could help me with. Do you think you could make that piano disappear? ...It'd help out in a lot of ways, really.
...People always tell me that. (Except I wasn't joking.)
One of the restaurant tables. This one's the closest to the piano. ...Which makes it the hardest to eat at, I hear. ...On days when I'm playing, that is.
A ukulele in a Russian restaurant?
Hawaiian shirts don't go with my complexion.
We competed that day seven years ago, too.
You choose your defense attorneys by playing poker.
...Trucy's "power"?
(For seven years I've played poker here at the Borscht Bowl Club... And I've never lost once. I'm good... but not that good. I win because whenever there's a big game, I bring in Trucy. ...And she sends me signals.)
Can you tell me what her power is?
...Her "line"?
Magnifi Gramarye...
Wait, so you're saying... ...her power is genetic? It's just "in" the Gramarye blood or something?
(It's some kind of Gramarye secret, then? Fine...)
She's still trying her best to follow in your footsteps, you know.
Wait, you were planning on vanishing from the get-go?
This...?
A transferal...? That's Magnifi Gramarye's signature, isn't it? "I hereby give all rights to the secrets, staging, and performance of my magic... ...to the recipient named below." And the recipient's name... is you... Zak Gramarye.
Wait... This page looks torn.
First... take a close look at this diary. ...Notice that a page has clearly been ripped out! As it just so happens... ...I have here what I believe to be the missing page.
...How could I forget? That scrap of paper lost me my attorney's badge.
...You could have told me this earlier. Like, seven years earlier.
(Sounds like a pretty important thing to have if you're his disciple.)
"Rightful"...?
Your daughter.
This person in the photo is Trucy's mother?
Trucy showed it to me. She said her mother was "gone"...
Huh?
(Um... lots?)
Whoa! You're still here!?
Wh-What!? Magnifi's daughter? Is that true, Mr. Zak...?
(Zak decked him...)
(Thalassa Gramarye... She's the most mysterious of the whole lot. I need to gather me some more evidence, clearly.)
This woman is Trucy's mother, yes?
She said her mother was "gone".
(Thalassa Gramarye... Magnifi Gramarye's only daughter. I need to gather me some more evidence, clearly.)
Mr. Zak, could you tell me about this?
It... wasn't a present. (This guy's a hard sell. Probably won't get a rise out of him unless I show him something real interesting.)
What's this...?
B-But... I'm not a lawyer anymore. And you need a public notary, besides.
You are...?
Ah... I've finally figured it out. Now I know why you've come out of hiding only now. It's been seven years, you said?
...There's a law that covers your situation. After seven years, missing persons are considered to be legally "deceased". So, if someone was to vanish from the face of the earth seven years ago... ...they would lose all rights as a "living person" after seven years from that day. Not to mention all of their possessions.
But do you really need this document? Wouldn't Trucy inherit your estate automatically?
"This case"...?
I see. So you do need this document.
...I took the liberty of looking into Trucy's background. And found you had no other close kin.
...... (OK... I was kind of hoping he'd say something about the mother at this point.)
(I know everyone else, but Trucy's mother... is a mystery.)
Zak's signature. I'm sure he's written it many times, being an ex-star and all. Hmm. I bet there's plenty of people out there who'd kill for a Zak Gramarye autograph.
Final...? Why?
...Without seeing your daughter?
...It's just a rumor.
......
Hey... I just signed your document for you. Maybe you could try lightening up?
(This guy is beyond serious... So much for a fun evening of cards.)
...? (Why haven't I seen her around here before?)
...?
You know him?
The Gramarye "power"... I was close to understanding it, but I needed more. And I knew where to get it. ...Trucy's mother. I'd need to meet that reporter again, that was clear... ...And one other thing. From the moment my "final competition" with Zak began that night... ...a name was running through my head. ...The name of a man now in prison. ...A name Zak Gramarye knew. But how? And why...?
Gavin...
My past is like my logic, straight and true. Nothing's changed. All I did was point the finger of justice in the proper direction.
You, too... Gavin.
Looks like you've got more than books up there.
(...Just a "little"?)
That's some chair. Just looking at it makes me want to take a seat. You'd probably have to add a whole digit to the price of one of my office chairs.
(...Those prison chairs don't look so bad, either. Maybe I should redecorate.)
Not really. I know appearances are a big thing with you.
That certainly does look like first rate nail polish. I like the sparkly bottle.
(Nice roses...) You taking care of this one here?
"Best"...? Come on, now I'm starting to feel bad for you.
Y-Your rose bites?
(Every dog has its thorn...)
(That envelope's been bothering me since I came in here...)
...You get mail here in jail?
(Hmm. Looks like sneaking a peek is out of the question.)
......
And I'll bet you never expected to wind up here. "Shadi Smith"... was the name of the man you killed. Did you know who he really was?
Zak Gramarye. You know, the defendant.
...Don't even try to tell me it was a coincidence.
After that trial, you were arrested and found guilty. But your motive was never made clear. ...A mistake I plan to remedy.
(...Not for me, it isn't. I need to know why you did it, Gavin.)
You recall that case seven years ago?
...That was when I met you, wasn't it?
The Bar Association review board voted unanimously for the "strictest punishment". Unanimous... save for one dissenting opinion. Yours.
For seven years we've been friends... ...and yet, I still don't understand you.
...Honestly, right now, I'm not sure what I think.
You didn't just brain a guy with a juice bottle for no reason. Tell me why you did it.
I came here... because I remembered something. The night of our "game"... ...Zak Gramarye mentioned your name, Gavin.
...?
...After that, he was killed. And I asked you to help me. ...Because I remembered your kindness back when everyone had turned on me.
...I have to know. Why did you kill Shadi Smith? No... Zak Gramarye!?
(Wh-Whoa! I've never seen Psyche-Locks like these! Dark... Cold... Full of despair... Can I even unlock these things...?)
...No. It's nothing.
(...He's doing his nails.)
What do you think about this, Gavin?
(No information forthcoming there, I guess.)
Hmm... "Ariadoney"... I've heard of that brand. And this must be the brand symbol... It's supposed to be some kind of flower. Wait, no, maybe it's a hand. Wait... on second thought. Is that an eagle? ...... Who makes these things up, anyway? You'd think they'd try for a clearer symbol, at least.
I decided on sooner. Drew Misham... was it?
...And I didn't come here to whine about past events. I wanted to ask you some questions.
I'm used to finding myself in outrageous situations.
...... (I'm not sure, but... ...it feels like I'm being watched... intensely.)
(She's gone...)
Ah, er, no, I was just checking out the door.
(Good thing I'm far too stubborn to take hints like that.)
What's this painting here...?
(Hmm... Not a feeling I know anything about... At least not yet.)
Paints are scattered all around. Probably the ones he's currently using. There's something very artistic about a messy room. Not that this is anything compared to my office. ...... I guess that would make my office a "masterpiece".
You use these gizmos for painting? They're pretty... elaborate.
(...Tools of the forgery trade, I guess.)
Maybe I'll just sidle on over here for a closer look...
That's a pretty bottle.
...?
(There's a light pink fluid inside. Nail polish, I'm guessing.)
This is you and Vera?
Ah... right. (Shouldn't you practice?)
What's this red envelope...?
(The painter's face just changed hue. Guess I'd better behave. Though it's tempting to just grab it...)
That's an awfully small frame. What's that inside it? A stamp?
...?
That's "Zak & Valant"... the Gramaryes, isn't it?
(Not anymore... ...now that one of them has vanished off the face of the Earth.)
...I see.
That's an awfully small frame. There's a commemorative stamp of the Gramaryes inside.
Paints and pigments are lined up on the shelves... with some noticable gaps.
I can see how you'd want to do that, sure.
(...Poor guy.)
These are some finished paintings stacked here. They don't look all that bad, really.
...... That's OK. They look kind of heavy.
(Maybe he needs to work on his sales technique a bit.)
Judging from this place... you're a painter?
Your daughter...?
Forgeries...
But... some of your "works" aren't paintings, correct?
What...?
Then why did you take the job!?
(I think he feels worse about it than I do... The past is hard to escape.)
Sorry, but it's not going to be quite so easy. (He's trying to forget what he made. Looks like I'll have to remind him.)
Well then. Ready to tell me about this "work" you did?
I guess it would be a little different from paintings.
...This wasn't a copy?
So you used the real writing as a reference to "reproduce" what the client wrote?
So... ...who was your client?
...Really? Even for such a suspicious request? If it was me, I'd want to know as much as I could about the requester.
(Ah. A Psyche-Lock. Of course.) It seems like you're still hiding something. Something about this "work".
Your "work"... Don't try to pretend you've forgotten.
Sure, all you did was make a "copy"... ...but that "copy" might have destroyed the life of an innocent man.
I'm responsible, too. Which is why I have to know. ...And you have to tell me.
Then... let's talk.
Your "work"... Don't try to pretend you've forgotten.
Sure, all you did was make a "copy"... ...but that "copy" might have destroyed the life of an innocent man.
So, Mr. Misham. Tell me about Magnifi's diary.
Mr. Misham, I was wondering if you could tell me about this...
(...Oh, so now he's the sensitive artist.)
...Let's hear it, then. What are you hiding from me, Mr. Misham?
...... (...True, when I asked the client's name... ...there were no Psyche-Locks in sight.) ...Regardless, you're hiding something! You have to be, otherwise it wouldn't make any sense.
(Well, I've made my stand. No backing down now. So... what's Misham hiding?)
Huh...?
Th-That's fine. I know where the court is. ...Unless you were just trying to get me to leave.
(He did say that, didn't he? And with no Psyche-Locks, either. So... he's not lying about that, I guess.)
You "personally"...?
......
I can pretty much piece together what it is from what you've said.
You told me what you knew about the client... ...and I couldn't see any Psyche-Locks...
...But then they did show up, didn't they?
...who was your client?
...Really? Even for such a suspicious request? If it was me, I'd want to know as much as I could about the requester.
"Not personally"... Those words triggered the Psyche-Lock!
So, you didn't meet with the client... ...but someone else did! ...Maybe the real forger behind this "evidence"?
(Yeah, well, I didn't come here to talk about Psyche-Locks.) ...As long as I come to the right conclusion, it doesn't matter how I got there.
The real forger behind this wasn't you, Mr. Misham!
...That's the real question, isn't it? If the forger wasn't you... ...then I don't have many other people to choose from. The real forger at Drew Studio is...!


...Well, Mr. Misham!?
...Huh?
...I know how to get to the court. (OK... now I'm confused. Who's really making the fakes here...?)
The real forger... ...is your daughter, Vera Misham, isn't it?
(Nice comeback... but you're shaking in your boots. I've got you now!) The only two people with access to the studio are you... and your daughter. The Psyche-Locks tell me you're not the forger. Which makes your daughter the only possibility.
...A precocious little girl outshining her father. There's been a lot of that going around recently.
(...Ah, do I detect a bit of fatherly pride?) So, Vera was the one who made this page. Would she know who the client was, then?
...What!? Why didn't you say so sooner!?
So... they talked to your daughter?
(That little girl might know something about him!)
(OK, what do I do now...? Maybe I should talk to her father a bit more... Or is it time to turn my attention to Vera?)
(...I suppose there's no sense in rushing things. Let's see if there's any more to get out of Daddy first.)
...Mr. Misham, I have a request.
...Can I?
Which was...?
...!
...Please, let me speak with her.
(Uh oh... this could be tough.)
Vera, was it? I... Would you like to have a friendly chat?
Er... I'm Phoenix Wright, ex-lawyer... and pianist!
I'm still looking for the keys that say "do re me". Can't find 'em anywhere!
(I'm no good at this. I need something to get through to this girl...)
Why don't you like the outside?
Well, true, but there're lots of good people, too.
K-Kidnapped...!?
I see... Wait. But that doesn't make sense. She said she went to the Gramarye Museum... ...with you, in fact.
A good luck charm?
...!
(From that client, huh? This I have to hear about.)
So, your father tells me you're good at painting all sorts of things...?
So... you did this, too?
Your first...?
(She seems happy. Odd... Her work was the last nail in the Gramarye coffin. I guess no one told her.)
Huh? Oh, you mean Troupe Gramarye? Of course.
Your father...? But... I asked him about it. He didn't know how you got it.
"Took" it...?
That person? You mean, that letter was from the client?
(They're a sneaky one, this client. So they were trying to get on her good side.)
So... you met the person that asked you to do this job? And... you talked with them?
What's this about a "good luck charm" you received?
Eh...?
Yeah... but I really, really have to know.
(Right. Time to do some psyche-unlocking.)
And then there's this...
(Hey! She spoke! She can talk!) Yeah, so this stamp... (How can I keep her talking?)
Can I have your stamp?
Ack, sorry, sorry! I won't take it, promise. (Wow, if looks could kill...)
This stamp... It's got a really nice frame.
(Yep, just keep her talking like that. Great job, Wright.)
Isn't Troupe Gramarye amazing?
Hmm? Yes?
I especially like those two, Zak and Valant. I mean they're, uh, just so magical!
Yeah! Whenever I go to one of their shows, I'm like... Whoa! Magic! ...You know?
(Alright! She's talking! Not saying much... but it's a start!)
The Gramarye M-Museum? They have one of those? (I guess it makes sense now that they have their own commemorative stamp...)
So... have you been to one of their shows?
Yeah, yeah! Maybe you can keep telling me stuff like this? You know... about Zak and Valant maybe...?
(Alright! Better get asking before she changes her mind.)
They look pretty incredible in this stamp. I mean... it's like magic!
(She's talking up a storm now! Better get what I can out of her before the storm passes over...)
Um, what do you think about this?
(...I think I just made her nervous. I need something to grab her attention... but what?)
You seem to trust this client... Quite a lot, in fact.
Because they gave you this stamp?
(The problem... that keeps her inside all the time?)
A good luck charm... that your client gave you?
I think I know what your client might have given you, actually. Is this your good luck charm...?


If this doesn't bring good luck, I don't know what would.
...Hmm? What do you mean?
(See that innocent smile? Everyone has a different way of breaking the news. That's the beautiful thing about being totally wrong.)
This... was what they gave you, wasn't it?
The same bottle's over there on your desk. Your good luck charm... right?
Ah... Of course it does. (I'll just refrain from commenting any more on that one.) I think I know who gave you that bottle, actually. The one who asked you to do this "job". Was this the client?


Vera? Is something wrong?
(...So you say. But... I know it wasn't the client. I don't see any Psyche-Locks clattering to the floor. *sigh* How could I get that one wrong? The answer is dangling in front of my face!)
This man... is a friend of mine. Know him?
His name is Kristoph Gavin. ...He's a lawyer, actually.
(I don't need a name anymore. I've got my answer...) You're pretty confident in this charm, then?
...Huh?
Wh-What do you mean?
...Are you saying the client's face looked like the Devil's?
So... where'd you see this "Devil" then?
(...I'm not sure what this "Devil" she saw was... ...but it's pretty clear that Kristoph Gavin has her "charmed"...)
Well... I think that's all. I'll be leaving now.
If you want to apologize, try my client, Zak Gramarye.
...What makes you think that?
...... I'll put on my smile next time I come, promise. ...I hope to see you smile then, too, Vera.
...Take care.
Thinking back on my first encounter with the young forger... ...I witnessed something of vital importance that day. ...Of course, by the time I realized it... ...it was already too late.
Excuse me?
There's been no proof that I forged anything.
......
(A little piano in a cold little hole-in-the-wall...)
(The shooting of Magnifi Gramarye, for one... Who pulled that trigger? Valant? Or his partner Zak? His partner vanished before the answer could be found. If I'm going to get any closer to the truth, this is the place to start.)
Smile, you're on candid camera. I just had to say it. Old habits die hard. Maybe I should do a few tricks for the viewers at home.
That guard keeps stealing glances in this direction. ...And scratching his head. Maybe our resident magician showed him a trick or two.
Yes. He made my attorney's badge disappear, and he never even touched it.
Revealing what?
(That's certainly been public opinion's take on it.)
Planning on jumping back into the magic right away?
...Yes?
(Is that true?)
The suspicion on you hasn't lifted entirely, Valant. After all... ...you received one of those letters, too. You were just as obligated to follow Magnifi's instructions as your partner.
I'm more interested in learning something else, actually.
I want to know what Magnifi had up his sleeve. How could he coerce you and your partner to kill him?
Know what?
(...I didn't think it would be that easy.)
Mr. Valant, could you look at this for me, please?
Challenge? Huh?
...... I didn't come here to play games, Mr. Valant. Or watch you do tricks.
(I'm flying by the seat of my pants on this one. There must be a path leading from the evidence to the truth... ...And that's what I'm going to find!) To ask someone to take a life, even one not long for this world... ...that's asking someone to commit murder.
...And he got his wish. His life was taken. What "weakness" could be so powerful as to coerce someone into committing murder? My guess is it was a matter of life... or death.
Your troupe lived in a world of showmanship -- the flashier, the better... ...and flashy so often means danger, doesn't it?


You don't agree, Mr. Valant?
(It's a little early for me to be making mistakes. Think deadly... and what's more deadly than a fatal accident? That could be the source of all the Gramaryes' problems...)
Specially designed for your show, I gather. A single bullet... One shot...
I'm not crying "murder", Mr. Valant. I'm crying something far more tragic... ...An accident.
Was the Shootem cancelled because someone might get hurt?
Well, it could have been cancelled because someone had already been hurt.
Well, tell me what would have happened if there had been an accident. What if one of your bullets took a life on stage?
(Looks like I've chosen the right path. Let's just hope he walks it with me.) A life was sacrificed so that the show might go on... and this shows who it was!


Yes?
Yeah... it does. Sort of.
(I hadn't actually been considering that as a career option.)
(Like figuring out who that bullet hit...)
Zak Gramarye's wife... and Trucy's mother. ...Thalassa, I believe was her name.
(Still in denial mode, eh?) Thalassa was at the greatest risk of being shot. And this clearly shows just how much danger she was in!


What do you mean?
...A single mistake can be fatal for an attorney, too.
(Thalassa's the key, I can see how her name affects him. But just a name isn't enough. I need to recreate that day in his mind. Starting with where she stood!)
Troupe Gramarye's performances were very, very popular. So popular, they even made a commemorative stamp at the height of your fame.
...It's all here on this stamp. ...There's Thalassa, yes?
Trucy's mother is "missing", I hear. ...What happened to her?
(A part of his memory is still locked up...)
What's that?
...... (Valant's got a point. If one of the troupe members died in an accident, and Magnifi covered it up... ...his innocence would come into question.)
(I'm so close! There has to be something. About how Thalassa's death could affect Zak and Valant's relationship with Magnifi.)
I'll prove why Thalassa's accident tied your hands so completely...
(...No better proof than the evidence!) The accidental death of Zak's wife tied both your hands... And his evidence proves why Magnifi held so much power over you!

N-No, of course not.
(Not a career choice I'd been considering, actually.)
(...I'd better stop dreaming and get to work here, fast. Magnifi used Thalassa's death as a means to control his disciples. How was that possible if he could be implicated in the cover up? ...Do I really have the evidence to prove this?)
(...It's going to take a little knowledge of the players to crack this one.) The accidental death of Zak's wife tied both your hands... And this information proves why Magnifi held so much power over you!


N-No, of course not.
(Not a career choice I'd been considering, actually.)
(The troupe was a tight-knit unit... it's all about the people involved. Their personalities, their histories. Who was Thalassa, really?)
It wasn't a question of who shot Thalassa... Thalassa herself was the problem!
She was Zak Gramarye's wife, Trucy's mother... ...and Magnifi Gramarye's only daughter!
There was a terrible accident... ...and the two of you killed your mentor's only daughter! If that wasn't the key to Magnifi's power over you, I don't know what was!
But Thalassa went missing... ...and your mentor blackmailed both of his disciples. It doesn't take a genius to put one and one together.
You mean Troupe Gramarye?
That does sound like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it?
...And that led to blackmail, I take it.
Why did Magnifi Gramarye try to cover up the "accident"...? It was his own daughter who died!
What do you mean?
I see... I guess I can understand. I mean, he did lose his only daughter.
Huh...?
(Things were dark behind the scenes in Troupe Gramarye, that's for sure.) Does Trucy know...?
True...
I'm sorry to dredge up old memories... but this has helped a lot.
...True.
...?
A reporter?
Would you happen to remember his name?
I see...
I see... Thanks for your help.
...I'm sorry.
I had begun to notice a dark curtain hanging over Troupe Gramarye... ...and I began to realize what I had to do. I had to protect Trucy from that darkness. The reporter he mentioned... ...the "newsman". I never learned who that was, at the time. ...Though I've got a pretty good idea who it is now. That smile, and the sickly sweet smell of mint. The last floss-thin thread connecting Zak Gramarye to this world. Sooner or later, I'd have to track him down.
Remember me?
Can I ask what you're doing here? Mr. Misham was poisoned, and his daughter's...
Were you on the trail of this case the whole time?
Zak said something to that effect back at the Borscht Bowl Club.
Do you think I could ask you a few questions?
......
...This is where Mr. Misham fell? Never thought our seven-year reunion would be quite like this.
...I met him once. In court. It was a... brief meeting, but one I'll remember for the rest of my life.
...... Could you at least get rid of the "down-on-his-luck" part?
The door outside. Vera might come walking in at any moment... if she wasn't in intensive care. Will she ever come through that door again, I wonder?
Those three paintings...
(I was about to say...)
A drafting table. Probably for making detailed designs for forgeries.
...... (You could drop this guy on a deserted island and he wouldn't get bored.)
That's an odd assortment of equipment to find in a painter's studio. Of course, it makes more sense when you know they were making forgeries. I guess that's why they never took visitors here. Wouldn't really want people seeing all this.
(...I'm beginning to have my doubts.)
Let's take a closer look at that desk.
This envelope's from the client who requested that forgery. Just think, if that had gotten lost in the mail... ...I'd still be wearing my attorney's badge.

...I just have to do that when I see this pose. I can't believe it's been seven years... ...I have to stop torturing myself with these things! I know! I'll just pretend it's saying something else. "The post office? Why, it's right over there! Good say, sir!"
A picture of a young Mr. Misham and a very young Vera. They're smiling. They look happy. Of course, now Mr. Misham's passed away... ...and Vera's on death's doorstep in the hospital. ...Guess I'll just do what I can... and hope it's enough.
This frame looks even smaller sitting next to that photo. Just the right size for a commemorative stamp, indeed. A commemorative stamp put there by a daughter... that killed her father. Sometimes, life just sucks.
Look at all the jars of paints and pigments. Why are there so many jars of the same color?
Age...?
Oh... right. Did you learn that in journalism school?
(...As long as you don't do news stories by imagination.)
...... (I find myself not caring anymore.)
It was tragic what happened to Drew Misham and his daughter.
...Yes. A forged diary page.
...What's that?
Being watched... you mean, he felt guilty?
...?
Because... you felt guilty?
(You felt like you were being "watched", huh? I wonder what it all means?)
Drew Misham felt like he was being "watched"... ...and you along with him. You sure it wasn't just nerves?
...!
And then... he dies.
And... you were being "watched" this whole time?
(M-Me...?)
You mean the shooting of Magnifi Gramarye?
You mean... the "accident"? During the Quick-Draw Shootem practice?
Valant Gramarye did mention one particularly "nosy reporter".
Really...
Zak Gramarye...
...Sorry, I don't know.
Waiting...?
Because of this. ...The performance rights.
...So Valant waited until Zak "died". Legally, at least.
He's getting ready for his show at the Sunshine Coliseum, you know.
"Love"...?
Hmm. That is pretty classic.
And in the middle of all this, Thalassa has Trucy. ...And then she dies. (I need to find out more about this Thalassa...)
You mean she was divorced...? (I hadn't heard this one before...)
I didn't know...
...? What do you mean?
What!? But... But Trucy said she was an only child!
Her previous husband...? Her first husband who died on stage?
(Thalassa had another child...?) Do you think I could borrow that photo?
(I won't need this locket anymore... Better return it to Trucy before I forget.)
Mr. Brushel? Do you know this person?
Thalassa Gramarye... ...Magnifi Gramarye's only daughter. ...Do you think you could tell me more about her?
Mr. Brushel, could you take a look at this?
Actually, no, that's OK. I don't need an article. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on this.
...Th-Thanks. (OK, that was less than informative.)
(I was too busy wondering about "biggerer" to listen to what you were saying.)
Maybe so. But still... ...I have to do what I can. And... I have to tell what I find to those who come next.
I'm not the one who will close the curtain on this little play. Apparently, that's not my role anymore.
...?
What do you mean?
You mean, how I can't lie to Trucy?
It's a strange thing. You think it's some Gramarye gene?
(...I wonder if Zak ever played a game of poker with his wife?) Who knows what the "Gramarye Secret" was...?
(Zak Gramarye...)
...The plot had finally begun to reveal itself. It sprouted from a warp in the Gramarye fabric, and grew, swallowing everything... ...wrapping itself around the Gramaryes' "power". A power which passed from Magnifi Gramarye to Thalassa ...to the next generation. And I would once again need to meet... ...the one who bridged it all together.
I have to know more about this "power" of Trucy's. It's like she can see right into people's minds...! The first time I saw her do it, it blew mine.
Er... Gotta use the resources at hand, I always say.
But Trucy does... ...Why's that?
Maybe Trucy got her "power" from her mother? Thalassa Gramarye...?
Thalassa is officially "missing", correct? And I think I know why you don't want to talk about her.


Well, Mr. Zak!?
Ah.
(For some reason, it's extra scary when magicians threaten me. I'd better rethink my strategy here!)
The three of you were a team, once. Not that the entire country doesn't already know this. At your peak, you were the biggest stars around. Yet, there's another story behind the fame. One that not many know. Thalassa lost her life during a rehearsal. ...To you and Valant Gramarye's bullets.
...I'm sure Valant would say the same thing. Why, it's just like another murder I might mention.
So the only one with her "power" left now... ...is Trucy?
Mr. Zak...?
(I don't need any "power" to see through that one, buddy.) So there's someone else. Someone other than Trucy. Someone who inherited Thalassa's "power".
(My chances are slim. It would take a miracle to learn the truth. Or maybe... one has already occurred.) There is someone else with the "power". And I know who...


...Huh?
(I don't need to make a miracle if one's already occurred... And I've known it all along. In fact, it would take a "miracle" for me to mess this one up! I know who the other one with the power is!)
His name is... I forget. Something weird.
An attorney.
I noticed him when I went to visit a friend's law offices.
......
Perhaps you wouldn't laugh if you knew the facts.
This might not be 100% proof, but it's close. There's a link between this boy and Thalassa... Actually, it's more of a "ring".
Perhaps this will refresh your memory. I just so happen to have evidence showing this "missing link"!


...Mr. Zak?
Yeah...
(Which I've just done, clearly. The question is, do I have a trump card in here somewhere? Think, Wright, think!)
Actually, I know something. Your marriage to Thalassa was her second.
Her first husband... He died a year after they were wed, yes?
I have a photograph of her here. I couldn't help notice what she was wearing when I first saw this. Those bracelets stand out.
This boy... ...wears a bracelet just like the ones in this picture.
Why what, Mr. Zak?
I bet I know where that other one went.
What... is it?
Tension...?
So, she could "see" it?
Objects...? Wait... were they something she wore?
(I admit the first time I saw one of those, I felt there was more to it than just fashion. But what kind of power could a bracelet have...?)
Well, I hardly need you to tell me at this point, but those two...
So Trucy has an older brother... I wonder what will come of that.
......
I understand. I'll tell the two of them when the time is right.
No kidding. What I want to know is how all this got to be so messed up...
So they're temperature sensitive or something?
...And this has something to do with the "power"?
Their muscles? Oh, so that's what the bracelets are for!
...So when the person they're watching gets tense... ...the bracelet feels tighter on their wrist!
But that alone doesn't really count as mind reading.
Eyesight...? (I guess that sounds simple enough...)
Something about the ability to see moving objects with full clarity, right? I've heard of it before. They say athletes can see a moving ball like it was stopped... if they focus.
...!
So, basically, what you're saying is... ...the Gramaryes can see really well?
Things are starting to come into focus for me, too.
Or some-"thing"!
But wait. Trucy doesn't have any bracelets.
...!
Thank you, Mr. Zak.
...I'll keep that in mind. Well, shall we play a game?
"That night"...?
...!
A test?
It seems to me that Magnifi wanted you to be his successor all along. That's why the time he gave you was earlier than Valant's.
...Waiting for you to "die". If seven years pass like this, the performance rights go to him.
It's worse than that, actually. Public opinion's a fickle thing, you know?
The trial ended when you vanished, Mr. Zak. There were even rumors that Valant had helped you pull it off.
...?
...That night, Zak Gramarye was killed. He died as "Shadi Smith", a mysterious traveler with a secret past. But he left one thing behind before he parted... This. His "confession". ...To use as I saw fit. ...Of course, he'd killed no one. This was his way of tying up loose ends with his old partner, Valant Gramarye.
Long time no see, Mr. Valant.
Actually, I came because there's something I want to ask you.
I've spoken to a lot of people myself... and come to some conclusions. But then I realized... ...I needed to hear it from you.
A man in a costume is handing out balloons to the kids. ...It's nice to know kids still like balloons, somehow.
Wouldn't all those balloons get in the way of seeing your show?
(Phoenix Wright, Entertainment Consultant.)
The "Sunshine Coliseum", was it? I'm not sure it actually qualifies as a "coliseum", but it's a great forum.
Oh, yeah, something about something going on during some concert?
Well, that's something. Did you help solve it?
...That's obstruction... of justice.
(*sigh*)
I don't think I've ever seen a hot-air balloon so close.
A little, I guess. But no one inside the coliseum would be able to see it.
(*sigh*)
That sure is a big sign.
Wow, your house is that big!?
That's... really beautiful.
Because you couldn't perform Magnifi's repertoire?
Zak Gramarye...
"Zak Gramarye murdered our mentor, and fled to escape punishment for his crime." You said something to that effect seven years ago, didn't you?
I had no idea.
Might I suggest it's because you never made it clear what happened? Magnifi's death is still a mystery to this day. ...Which is why I came here to get the answer from you.
(...I knew I'd be seeing these sooner or later.)
(That sounds an awful lot like something I heard seven years ago...)
Could you take a look at this, Mr. Valant?
Ah, right. Sorry. (What does the balloon guy have to do with his show?)
I'm as much a part of this affair as you are now. I have to know what happened.
(Sorry to do this, Valant... But right now, I need answers. I think I'll start... by dropping a bomb. That should shake things up.) Valant... I wouldn't be so sure about those miracles. Not as long as I have this.


Let me be frank, too. That's the first time anyone's called me "silly-frilly". (What I need is a bit of magic... something to stop Valant's show in its tracks. ...Now's no time for subtlety.)
I should have brought this to your attention sooner. But I didn't imagine you'd be planning your comeback quite so fast.
A document showing the true recipient of the performance rights to Magnifi's miracles.
Trucy Enigmar... Actually, she's officially my daughter these days.
This is the genuine article. ...Zak was alive when he wrote this. Both myself and the notary can testify to this.
...You're not the only one with that problem.
Did you think there might be some way out of it? Say, if you could prove Zak Gramarye shot Magnifi? Was that why you testified?
Well, it might not be too late, Mr. Valant. All you need is a way to prove your case. Who really killed Magnifi Gramarye?


...Well?
(There's one easy way to win over public opinion... By producing a signed confession... even if the confession is a fake.)
I believe I have the answer to your prayers right here. Zak Gramarye wrote one more thing before passing on.
In which he admits to the killing of Magnifi Gramarye. ...See? All according to your plan.
Zak wrote this right in front of me. ...After I explained your situation to him.
Yes. It's my opinion that Zak Gramarye killed no one.
...That would be the logical conclusion, yes.
Did you shoot Magnifi Gramarye in the forehead?
......
(I knew it... So Valant Gramarye did kill the Great Magnifi.)
Wh-What!? But if it wasn't you, then who was it!? There wasn't another disciple, was there!?
I don't know... "Knack & Talent Gramarye", maybe?
(If it wasn't Zak or Valant who shot Magnifi... ...then it had to be the only other person at the scene, which means...) W-Wait... You don't mean...!?
So Magnifi Gramarye... committed suicide?
To be honest, I hadn't even imagined it as a possibility.
...So you spoke with Magnifi Gramarye?
I see... Then I guess I owe you an apology. I always thought you were the one who did it.
...Huh?
Wh-What!? Your "crime"...?
(Is Valant Gramarye confessing something to me...? What could be more serious than murder?)
...!
He wanted to die by one of your hands...?
The demon...
Wha... Whaaat!?
Which was...?
But... you didn't shoot him.
Magnifi Gramarye... killing himself.
So in the end, things happened pretty much as planned. Magnifi died, and you framed Zak for his murder.
...... That was seven years ago. I don't know what to believe. But...
I'm glad I heard it from you, Mr. Valant. Thank you.
...You're going to turn yourself in?
...I understand.
(Well, not anymore.)
...What do you mean?
Um, "her"...?
Zak Gramarye... "Shadi Smith". Whichever name you prefer... he is no longer with us. The truth revealed in that trial was only a sliver... ...and the impenetrable darkness that remained has taken another life. I knew what I'd have to do to push back the darkness for good. And it would involve paying that man a visit.
I see... Do you know when he'll be finished?
...Could you go find out?
(My apologies to the guard... But there's something I need to see.)
Apparently, Gavin brought everything in here with him when he came. All the things in here are more valuable than what I have in my office. ...I'll admit I'm a bit jealous. But I shouldn't be... I mean it's still a prison.
That chair is just screaming to be sat in. And if I sat... I'd probably fall asleep. ...And have very expensive dreams.
My knowledge of flower names includes sunflowers, tulips, and that's about it. ...Or so I always thought, but now I see I was wrong! I know that this is a rose! ...I think?
...There it is. The yellow envelope! And the sender is... Drew Misham! I was right!
If this is the last letter that Drew Misham wrote... ...then there's something I need to do. ...The last thing I need to do, in fact. ...Here goes! Let's see if this atroquinine spray finds anything...
So this was Drew Misham's "messenger of death". It was this stamp alright! No mistaking it! And his last letter... was sent to Kristoph Gavin. Gotcha.
Finally... decisive evidence!
There's no mistaking it. This commemorative stamp was the one on the desk at Drew Studio. ...Which makes this the letter he mailed just before he died. Better hold on to this one.
...Gavin!
Gavin... There's something I have to ask you.
...... Vera Misham hasn't received her verdict yet. ...You follow me, Gavin?
...OK, I'll be leaving now, then.
...Yeah, Gavin?
Oh, sorry. Forgot I had it.
...We've now seen all the clues in this case. Clues I gathered over seven long years. Now, it is time. Every story has an ending. We've come to the final chapter, the final trial. Find the truth. You're the only ones who can.
No clues here.
(I may not have enough evidence right now to pull this off. Maybe it's time to do a little more legwork.)
...Welcome to court. Seven years... all leading to one verdict. A verdict which you must decide. Is the defendant, Vera Misham, innocent... or guilty? The courtroom doors are opening... the trial awaits. Are you ready to begin?
What's this...?
I received the files from your previous attorney only yesterday.
Yes, well, you haven't really told me what happened yet! All we did... was play cards.
...Resist what? Presenting solid evidence?
If a decision cannot be reached today... ...it may never be reached. The factors involved are simple. Did the defendant poison her father that night...? If so, she is guilty. Or was there another reason for Mr. Misham's death? Did another person poison him? If so, she is innocent. A panel has been provided for each of you to input your decisions. That is all...
...Yes, Jurist No. 6?
...That is correct. I've looked into all your dossiers. None of you were involved with the development of the case.
...Does that answer your concern?
...It's time for your verdicts. Make your decision in the case against Vera Misham! After seven years... the truth is ready to be heard. ...... Judge wisely. Judge well.
So... Your memory's returned.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ah, you're thinking into it too much. ...Besides. There was no guarantee that regaining your memory would make you happy.
......
Are you going to tell them?
Nope. They don't know their mother. They don't even know they're siblings.
...Don't worry, I'll take care of them for you. They're... They're very important to me, too. ...A little annoying at times, but still. (I have to keep an eye on her, at least. Because I'm the only one who knows how she really feels... on the inside.) ...Your bracelet.
I've seen a lot of mysterious things these past seven years. ...But your bracelets were the strangest of all. I remember meeting him, half a year ago now, in Kristoph Gavin's office... ...and then I met you. Two fates destined to intertwine... and I was there when they crossed. I'll never forget that.
......
...Speaking of miracles. Vera Misham regained consciousness this morning. I can only hope she's as glad as you are.
You know what I've been thinking? People don't die that easily, really. ...As long as they've got something worth living for.
Well, it's finally over. You know, thinking about it... ...I've been a piano player longer than I was a laywer. Now that everything's sorted, and I've got time on my hands, maybe I'll take some lessons. ...Or maybe I'll take the bar exam... again.

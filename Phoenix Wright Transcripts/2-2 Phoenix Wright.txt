It's not your fault. You didn't do it.
But that wasn't you.
(I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...)
Uh, I guess...
Well, it's the weather...
Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...?
(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)
"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?
Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.
(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)
I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?
(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...?
Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?
...?
...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)
Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!?
Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.
Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!
Huh?
(Is Maya... really that famous...?)
For what?
O-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)
(That's what she told me...I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...)
A condition...?
Me...?
(And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...)
(So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.)
W-Why, hello there.
Hmm... What an odd little girl.
(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)
M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.
It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.
It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.
Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.
It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later.
An old bus stop. It says "Kurain Village" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day.
A giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the "Kurain Boulder". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that...
Rustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though...
The biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence...
Looks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job.
But this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...?
Huh? Um, so what is this "Maya Intelligence Network" anyway...?
That's what I thought.
...
(Y-Yeah, I guess so.)
So this is your hometown, huh, Maya?
Interesting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium?
(That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...)
So what do the men do?
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her?
Pearly?
Cousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...?
Hmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier.
S-Suspicious-looking...!?
Of course not.
Aunt?
What do you mean by "tarnished"...?
You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself.
(Were you training to be a medium or a cook?)
"Client," huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you?
Don't say that with such a big smile on your face.
What do you think about this person?
...And that's a legend now?
Huh? Oh, yeah...
Alright. Good luck, Maya.
(Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.)
Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy?
(Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...)
(No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...)
A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off.
Someone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: "Once in a Lifetime." Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances.
A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... "100 Ways to Save Money". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life...
This door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice.
What are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called?
A signed confession?
O-Oh, I see...
So, how did you hear about Maya Fey...?
The home, huh...?
Master...?
Look, here's my attorney's badge.
...Uh...
(This doctor needs his head examined...)
Wow, this manor is really nice, don't you think?
Huh?
(Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...)
(I guess there are "Master" mediums, too...)
What do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey?
W-What is it?
R-Really...
(Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...)
Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright...
("Good sir"...? Is she talking about me?)
Is that so? ("Mystic" Maya...?)
N-Nice to meet you.
Huh?
(First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for "How Not to Make a First Impression"...?)
...Ah, thank you...
The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one.
This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air.
I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important. A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement.
(She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...)
This folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later...
There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark.
So why do you add "Mystic" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange?
Yes!
I-I'm sorry.
Um, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh...
Excuse me? "Blood"?
(Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?)
OK... Then... where do you stand...?
...Branch family? What's that?
So... how strong are you...?
(So that's how it is...)
So today's channeling will be her first?
("Traffic accident" indeed.)
So... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...?
I don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session...
O-Oh.
(That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...)
Oh, that's what the lock is for...
Y-Yes!
Wh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all!
Ow-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?)
About this person...
Insignificant...?
(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)
Ack!
Uh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.)
Pearl?
Oh, that odd...
Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha...
(Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...)
Okay, okay, I get it!
(Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...)
A splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity...
It's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash.
It looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it.
It's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.
(So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...)
It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. "Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp*
It's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll.
This is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.
There's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep...
(Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...)
Um... You... are... uh...
Um, Lotta Hair, was it?
Ah, no, um, I wasn't "making fun"... I was "complimenting" you on your fine hair...
Hold up... ou were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...
Oh yeah! That's it!
Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.
You're Lotta Hart, right...?
Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.
Sorry, but who are you again?
Come on, am I really that bad...?
Ah! You're the one from that trial!
You were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...
Um... So what brings you here today?
Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.
Is it that time already!?
(Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...)
Me!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would.
(Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!)
(It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...)
(M-Maya! Maya's in there!)
What else!? We're going to break in!
We're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey?
Don't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later!
Ms. Fey! What should we do!?
But... The key...
(Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down!
D-Dr. Grey!!
M-Maya?
Wh-What!?
Lotta! At a time like this!?
But, but...
(My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...)
They're on their way.
(She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...)
(Oh, yeah... Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.)
Lotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey?
Really?
(I sort of got the same impression myself...)
(Yeah, I guess so...)
Ms. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya?
Let me see her, please!
(Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*)
What are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe?
(Why is he grinning at me...?)
(The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...)
(She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta?
Eek! Don't scare me like that!
Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?
What is it!?
Huh-what?
What is too much?
Going after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore?
What's up?
Wh-What is it?
Huh?
(Ack! She did! Two even!)
L-Lotta!
That wasn't Maya! She was being controlled by a spirit...
(Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?)
(Somehow, I highly doubt it...)
(And she calls herself a journalist??)
(I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?)
(The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...)
Look, I really need to ask you some questions!
I'm just looking at it.
(I guess if I want to search this room, I'm going to have to come back later...)
Um, about Maya...
(Yeah. Only Maya and the victim were inside this room, after all...) But Maya is...
(Detective Gumshoe looks like a real professional. And yet, something about his expression still looks the same...)
So... Dr. Grey was shot with a gun, huh?
But...?
(...A knife?)
(He didn't even take a glance at it...)
(Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...)
Ack! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I...
Huh? Time to start what?
Channeling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed...
Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!
Yes! A person has killed another person!
...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?)
"Parapsychology"?
(That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.
You left the blanket a mess. Are you going to fold it?
So what brings you here today?
(Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.)
I see... Then why were you taking a nap here?
Huh?
Oh, that doesn't sound fun.
So you were sleeping here the entire time?
So you don't know anything about the murder that took place?
The surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey.
You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right?
Oh really...? That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...
(She sounds like she's trying to hide something...)
("Waaaay famous"? Maya?)
(Hmm... Well, at least she remembers some things.)
What!? ...Y-You're joking, right?
(Oh, thank goodness...)
(Hmm. Why does it feel like she's just putting on an act?)
Oh?
Well, thanks for trying. (I didn't think it was possible for someone to be this much of an airhead...)
(There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you?
You're Pearl, right?
(Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...)
Um...
(...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?)
Um...
(...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?)
(What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...)
(*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!)
Maya!
Calm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...)
It's not your fault. You didn't do it.
But that wasn't you.
(I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...)
Smile, you're on candid camera.
This guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he's bored. Not that I can tell since he never looks over this way.
So you're the Master or something of the Kurain School of Channeling...?
But many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act.
Yeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...)
What exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber?
OK...
(This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...)
What?
Then, you don't remember a single thing?
(Hmm...)
A dream...?
What kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...?
I... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...)
Under the ground?
(I should've known better...)
Ack! I'm sorry! (Why did I pull this picture out!?)
Huh? What are you talking about?
(Talk about bringing the mood down even further... *sigh*)
It's alright, Maya. I'm sure she understands. She's on our side, after all.
That girl is still after the next sensational photo.
So... what do you think about this person...?
(I guess I can't expect her to know anything about this person.)
... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK?
The document requesting me to be your attorney, of course.
What's wrong?
No one's decided that yet.
That's enough, Maya.
Stop it!
Don't worry, I will. When is the trial?
(As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now.
...?
Phew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...)
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.
Charley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella.
A poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay.
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe.
It's my desk. I keep it neat for those rare occasions when I actually have a client in the office.
(Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.)
(I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?)
(The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...)
It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two...
Good morning.
I'm sure Maya will be very grateful...
(Urk. She is one scary lady.)
(I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...)
The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things.
This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here.
I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important. A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling...
It's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ... ! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet?
There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there.
I would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday.
M-Maya?
What happened here in this room after I left?
To make her go unconscious, correct?
"Spirit Severing Technique"?
(I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...)
By the way, what is this room exactly...?
What do you mean?
Revolt? But how?
But isn't that extremely dangerous?
But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling...
And that is...?
(Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...)
So... How is Pearl today...?
Y-Yes?
Th-That's very impressive.
(Wow... She's really fired up now...)
"Quit"? Quit what?
Wh-What is it?
I-I'm sorry!
Y-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?)
I see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...?
(Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...)
I'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?)
(Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an "old man" yet!!)
(I guess that's possible...)
Y...Yes?
N-No!! It's not one of those at all!!
N-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...)
And? Anything else?
(Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?)
H-Hey, what do you mean, "especially people like me?"
Y-Yes, madam...
(What is that supposed to mean!?)
Alright. Please tell Maya I said hi.
Uh, I mean, Mystic Maya.
(...*sigh*)
(Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?)
No, no, I'm a lawyer.
...That's "Wright". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is "Wright".
(I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here?
Um, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today?
S-Sorry. My bad.
...
...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!?
... (If Lotta ever wanted another "genuine mysterious phenomenon", it's right here.)
It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. "Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling" What the!? It's a souvenir.
Ah... so it's yours, huh?
Heh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?)
I-Is that right?
(Has she actually tried to fight one!?)
Hmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.
So? Why are you still here today?
Like what?
(I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.)
(She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...)
Have you heard about the murder?
(...she says, with a silly smile plastered on her face...) ...So do you know anything about it that might help?
(Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.)
About the victim, Dr. Grey...
(That's right... Her reaction yesterday when I asked was...)
You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right?
Oh really...? That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...
(OK, she is definitely hiding something from me...)
Would you take a look at this?
No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. L-A-W-Y-E-R!!
It's so totally not for you!
(That should be my line...)
I wanted to ask you about this girl...
You surprise me. You knew that?
(Maya an idol? I guess stranger things have happened.)
(Did she just bow to the picture...?)
Oh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to know what you knew about her.
I see.
OK. (This is going nowhere...)
What!? ...Y-You're joking, right?
(Oh, thank goodness...)
(Who said anything about giving this to you!?)
What do you know about this person...?
*yawn* (Ack! She's even got ME yawning!)
Ack! Y-You surprised me!
And how are you today?
(Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...)
Um...
H-Huh?? (If only I had something that would catch her interest. Maybe then she'd talk to me.)
Can you take a look at this? Please?
(Urk... She's really scrutinizing my face...)
(Th-That's enough already! I'm not that shifty-looking, am I!?)
Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...
(Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...)
...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!)
I-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya...
...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked "Nick" up from...)
WH-WH-WH-WHAT!?
W-Well, yeah... I will...
...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?)
W-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like...
Pearl, are you friends with Maya?
Wow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered.
O-Oh, sorry.
(Where in the world did she get an idea like that??)
Which channeling school?
... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer.
Yup.
(Um... None that I know of...) Wait, are you telling me you don't know what a lawyer is?
(Maya did say Pearl doesn't know much about the outside world...)
So what's that you've got there, Pearl?
Hmm...
I can't take something this important from you, Pearl.
(But I'm sure I've seen that key somewhere before... ...and it might be an important clue later on...)
Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...
(...She not only speaks in a refined manner, but laughs in one, too!)
So this is...
Y-Yeah, I will. (Is it really OK for me to have such a priceless object?)
Oh? Is that what's written on it? Actually, what caught my eye was this "hole" in it...
(...It sure doesn't look like something bugs can make...)
About this key...
I've seen it before too, you know?
Ack! OK, OK! I get the idea! (She really thinks the world of Maya, doesn't she?)
Your hair now suits you quite well, though, I think.
*fidget, fidget*
("Branch family"... That concept is probably still too hard for little Pearl...)
No, no, no, it's OK. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. I'm very sorry. (This feels so weird, talking to a kid like this...)
I guess that makes sense... You've never left Kurain village, after all.
Yes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl.
Yeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you.
Spiritual energy?
...What do you mean?
See people's... secrets...?
Yes.
Detective Gumshoe...
(Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...)
D-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous!
What about Maya and the charges against her?
You've got proof...?
(He must be talking about Lotta. Actually... speaking of Lotta...)
Huh?
(Lotta's "hot pictures"... I wonder what her camera captured...?)
(...!)
(What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?)
About Dr. Grey...
Yeah, I know.
(He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...)
(A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...)
About Maya's trial tomorrow...
Two?
...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it.
WHAT!? Von Karma!?
(Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.)
... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and...
Successor...?
So, um... Who is this "successor" to Von Karma?
Hmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about...
(Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name "Von Karma", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix! That person is already gone...)
Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge.
What is it, Pearls?
Ah, no, it's OK. It's not that important anyway.
What do you think about this...?
(Happy?... About what?)
Um, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and...
Fourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink.
You mean the car accident the nurse died in?
Alright. Thanks.
(Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.)
So about this key...
Come on, does this look like a house key to you?
It's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key.
It's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet!
(Now why is he sighing?)
Do you know her?
...Nope. Not a clue.
(Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...)
(There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...)
Uh, what?
Oh.
You don't have to be so mean about it.
(That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*)
Hello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today.
W-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?)
I want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey.
Aaack! What is that!?
Huh, what...?
(Psyche-Locks, huh...)
"Unlock"...? But how?
(I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.)
(Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.)
Iim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey?
(This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock. Alright, so first, I have to use Maya's Magatama...)
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Ini Miney. I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is!
While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him.
(I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...)
Leads to:
Here is your proof!
Ouch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... "If you make a mistake, it will hurt you," she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably "stop". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.)
Take a look at this newspaper clipping.
Please read the victim's name.
"Miney" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she?
I'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic?
Grey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister!
Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.
(That's what I thought...)
Wiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel?
The one where 14 patients died from malpractice?
Oh... I'm sorry...
...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to...
Hmm? What's wrong?
R-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing...
Hey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*)
(What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?)
(Huh? Must be Maya...)
...! (That voice...) M-Mia!
(Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into "retirement". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...)
...!
Mia...
B-But!
(I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...)
Mia... What am I supposed to do?
A-And that is!? Tell me, please!
You think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!?
Y-Yes?
Can't have "dreams"...?
Yeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground.
...! Then... What does this mean!?
A set-up!?
How am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!?
I-It is!?
(R-Really...?)
(The "key", huh? Alright, I'll show it to her; the "key" I hold.)
Mia...
(Mia...)
Maya gave it to me, but...
(She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...)
Mia, have you seen this key before?
This key?
(What does she mean...?)
I-I will...
Could you take a look at this?
But... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...?
(At the time, I didn't know, but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...)
M-Mia!? Wh-What...!?
(That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer! But for this to be something that she would hide under lock and key from even me... What in the world is going on!?)
No clues here.
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
No, I heard it's his successor this time...
(He was a man obsessed with the word "perfection"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)
Don't tell me you walked all the way here...
That's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)
(I give up...)
Maya:
Maya:
Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again...
I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...
... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.
... (What is with this girl...?)
Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)
...!
(...Hold on. So this kid is the "famed" Prosecutor von Karma...?)
I... see...
Revenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)
(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!
Your Honor.
...Yes.
("Justified self-defense"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself. We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of "not guilty", Your Honor! (Because to plead "justified self-defense" is to say you did kill someone.)
(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)
(The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...)
The murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?
The victim? Now, why would he have...
(Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.)
Point blank, huh? So about how far away was it?
And how do you know he was shot at point blank?
E-Excuse me!?
...Gunpowder burn?
(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)
Stabbed... And what was he stabbed with?
(Urk. This does not look good...)
How severe was the wound?
(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)
Are you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?
(Grr... What a pain...)
(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)
(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)
Y-Yes?
(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)
(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to "justified self-defense"...
(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)
(...! If we plead "justified self-defense", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!
The defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!
(If we plead "justified self-defense"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!
The defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!
(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)
(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)
Why didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!?
...
Maya's... costume?
(Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?)
This blood on the costume...
(Definitely not good... Urk.) Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam from this piece of evidence?
(Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?)
(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.
(Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be a clue somewhere on this costume! I just have to look harder!)
(Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...)
(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.
Your Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence.
(I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!
Leads to:
The problem is obviously the blood splatter here!
Yeah... I wonder about that too...
P-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...)
There is a problem... somewhere around... here!
(I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!)
I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.
(It looks like I've found the "hole" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!
...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)
H-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!
No way!!
Alright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?
Missing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!
But they do.
(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)
He wasn't "fighting back"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?
(Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...)
Leads to:
(That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!)
Detective Dick Gumshoe!
You said that my client killed "a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back."
Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?
I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to "not fight back"?
(Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...)
(What is with that "are you finished yet" laugh?)
Ack!
Nooooo!!
(Just by listening, it does make sense... However, I won't give up that easily!)
There is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim!
...?
(I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!)
...
So he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him.
How bad would you say it was?
Where in the world did that pistol come from?
But a handgun...?
(Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?)
So, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then?
(Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...)
Leads to:
Maya has never fired a gun before in her life!
(Even me...? I wonder...?)
(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!)
Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.
This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!
You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!?
This is what you testified earlier: "When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole."
But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!
It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other.
Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.
As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!
(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)
(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a "hole" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.
(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)
Your Honor! Please... Wait!
(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)
There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!
(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! "She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot." There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)
Leads to:
Take a look at this!
Prosecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...
...Huh?
(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)
This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.
I would like to point the court's attention to the "hole" in this folding screen.
It looks like you already know what I'm talking about.
(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!
Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area.
Leads to:
Here!
Ack!
Um...
... Yeah, I guess so...
(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)
Somewhere around here!
(Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean...
Uh, sure...
(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)
She was standing here, near the folding screen!
That's impossible.
You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!
(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!)
Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?
Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?
Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!
(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)
(...blast radius of disaster.)
(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)
(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)
Phew, that was a close one.
I felt like I was pretty close to dying myself...
Th-Thanks. Wait... Tricked??
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart.
Just fine...
Eh? ...Excuse me?
(The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?)
(I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!)
Was it really only those two that went in!?
Urk.
...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room...
Was it really a gunshot!?
Urk.
...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot...
(...And the world becomes just a little crueler...)
So, let me get this straight! This "Mr. Lawyer there" broke the door down!?
Um... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?)
(The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a good sign...)
Are you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!?
(Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...)
Lotta! Please, think back to that day one more time.
Remember what you said when we broke into the room...?
Lotta! At a time like this!?
When you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!?
(Good. This shifts things back to my side...)
!
(Yeah... It was Maya that went in.)
(Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!)
(Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...)
Are you absolutely certain of that!?
("Old witch"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?)
(The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?)
What about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there?
Huh? What in the...?
What about... behind the door? Did you check there?
(She actually had the police investigate that too!?)
What about... under the flooring? Did you check there?
Huh?... Wh-What are you talking about?
(Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?)
(Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too, and her story is exactly how I would have told it...)
(Argh! Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...)
(What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...)
(If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?)
Your Honor!
It is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant!
(Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...)
Leads to:
Here is your proof!
Is there a problem?
(Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...)
Nothing, Your Honor...
(I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...)
(I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?)
(I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense...
M-Mia!
Y-You... But... P-Pearls!
B-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage!
D-Dr. Grey!!
W-What!?
Lotta! At a time like this!?
Mia...?
Please wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time.
Please tell us once more what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber.
(Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...)
(Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!)
So, what did she look like?
Then perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all!
Well, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww!
(Urk... Sorry, Maya...)
And even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer?
(She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah!
(Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...)
Leads to:
Two, right?
Two shots. You took two shots.
Ms. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!?
(Well, at least she knows herself...)
W-What!? V... Von Karma!!
(Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!)
Your Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court!
But... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair!
(Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...)
(...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...)
H-How could you think...!?
"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?" How... How can you say that!?
(This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?)
... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...)
Your Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey!
There is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant!
Mia! We did it!
Huh?
(S-She's... smiling...!?)
(M-Mia!)
(Wh-What is she...?)
(I... I don't have even a single witty line...)
(If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?)
(It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!)
...Yes... Your Honor...
Y-Yes?
Yeah... Some way...
(Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now.
Please! Please let me explain!
Your Honor!
This picture... Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now.
Leads to: "Please direct your attention here!"
Please direct your attention here!
With your own two eyes, you can clearly see that this face does not belong to Maya Fey!
AAAH! THAT HURT!
(*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!)
The contradiction lies... Here!
Excuse me, but can you really tell me how much confidence I have in this!?
AAAH! THAT HURT!
(*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!)
Please direct your attention here!
And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing.
There was a bullet hole in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well!
(Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...)
You like to bring down the mood, don't you?
(Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.)
(She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!)
(Poor Gumshoe...)
Got it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!
The fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake!
Well, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se...
S-Sorry, Chief...
There is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place!
Hmm... I-Is that how it went?
Y-Yes, Chief...
The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether!
Aah!
A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us.
Umm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?)
(I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?)
(To "turn things around"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!)
(So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...)
I think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is...
Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place!
Leads to:
Please take a good look at this!
Thank you.
Don't you see, Your Honor?
... *sigh*
(Ouch, that stung...)
(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...)
Maya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this!
Leads to:
The evidence you're looking for is... this?
Well, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...?
(Oww... That burned...)
(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...)
I'm sorry, but I simply can't.
But Mia!
(Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!)
Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?
Yes? (It looks like she's catching on...)
If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her.
However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest!
I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time!
This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you!
(...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.)
Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance.
Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets?
(Poor thing... So sheltered.)
You're welcome. I had to come and look into a few things here today anyway.
?
She definitely didn't!
Yes, Pearls.
(I wonder what's wrong... She seems sad...)
It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. I called the police from this phone.
So, what did you think of seeing your first trial?
O-Oh...
(Well, Maya's already naturally short, so...)
(Ruffly... Oh, she means Franziska...)
(I wouldn't miss tomorrow's trial for the world...)
Well, she's the opposite of a lawyer -- a prosecutor, so her job is to prove people guilty. They don't care if someone's innocent. All they care about is if they win.
... There's no one like that. All prosecutors are the same. ... Well, "he" might have become a good guy... Eventually...
...That was a long time ago. He's not around anymore...
He clutched onto his foolish pride too fiercely... and died for it.
By the way...
Um, you wouldn't happen to know anything about who the murderer is... would you?
No, I was just thinking earlier...
(She "didn't see anything", huh...? Speaking of that... During the murder... where was Pearls, and what was she doing...? And on top of that... This key... Just when did she pick this up...?)
I just realized that I never asked you what you were doing at the time of the crime.
Pearls, where were you and what were you doing when the murder happened?
...?
(She's really bad at lying...) You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone else. I promise.
Aah!
Yeah... Clearly.
You really won't tell me what you were doing at the time of the murder...?
But with the Magatama, I can unlock your Psyche-Locks, right?
(If you would just tell me, it would be easier for the both of us...)
(Pearls is holding the key to this whole case! I can feel it! ...Speaking of keys, this one turned out to be quite important too... I didn't think it would literally be the "key" to today's trial.)
Huh?
(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)
Oh? Is that what's written on it?
(So basically, this has nothing to do with the murder... Well, that's super.)
About this key, Pearls... You found it on the day of the murder, right?
Now, where you found this key is very important. So, please tell me, Pearl. Where did you find this?
The incinerator? (Hmm, is she talking about the one in the garden?)
When was that?
Hmm...
...? Yes?
Huh? You mean, tell Morgan what you did?
...Ah, gotcha. Well, let's keep it a secret from her then, alright? (Hmm, the incinerator, huh? Sounds like a good place to search next...)
Really!? Where!?
(Oh... That's right... This knife belongs to the Feys...)
O-OK... Thanks.
(Ack!! I shouldn't have shown her something this violent...)
Umm... It's nothing. Really. Just forget your ever saw this, okay? (What was I thinking? I can't show stuff like this to a child.)
(On second thought, showing her this picture might cause severe trauma...)
("Master of Lawyers"... I guess...? I mean, it's not exactly a martial art...)
Y-Yeah, you're probably right.
I think your hair now suits you perfectly.
*fidget, fidget*
C-Can spirit mediums really do that...?
(When they're mad, the women of the Fey family could give Medusa a run for her money...)
This case has had me out of the office most of the time... I can come back tomorrow. Helping Maya should be my top priority now.
Charley. A quite decroative plant. He's a handfull but i've grown quite attatched to the little fella. He also helps me to remember all the good times with Mia.
(Maya must still be in questioning... She'll probably be done in a little bit, so I'll come back later...)
(It's really empty... There's supposed to be training held today, but I guess it's already over...)
A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. But I guess it wasn't strong enough to withstand The Phoenix!
(...Hmm, looks like Morgan's here too, but she hasn't noticed me yet... What is she doing...? She looks like she's talking to a picture...)
(What in the...!?)
Um... Just curious, but that picture you were just looking at...
Huh, oh, yes... Thank you.
(I get the sense she really doesn't want to talk about the picture...)
There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. There wasn't anyone back here at the time of the murder... Or that's what Lotta testified in court... (I knew I should've taken a look... I can always count on Lotta to make things hard...)
Have you remembered something about the murder?
Were you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police?
Hmm, you said that yesterday as well. Did anything else happen?
(Ah, I was really hoping for some new info...)
(Why do I feel like I was just made fun of in the worse way possible...?)
So do the students train every day?
And I assume both Maya and Pearls went through this training...?
Ack! Yes, yes! (Wow, she got real scary, real fast...)
S-Sorry... I meant Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl... Wait... I'm sorry, but "Mystic" Pearl? Isn't that going a bit too far...?
(Oh man... She's really being a pain in the butt about this...)
So the Master is... um, Maya's mother, right?
And where is she now...?
Not sure?
...
...Erased?
Oh, I see.
And...?
(I must be imagining things... I thought she was laughing to herself for a second there...)
Well, that's...
That's right.
That, I'm not telling.
I... I can't. It's evidence, after all. (I think she knows exactly how important this key is to this murder... But what is this feeling I'm getting from her? It feels... Hmm... I can't describe it.)
But we don't know that it was Maya that did it...
(Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?)
(You do realize that the "Heartland" is a part of this country, right...?)
About this person...
Insignificant...?
(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)
It's Mia. You know, Maya's older sister?
(...How could you forget a daughter of the Master...!?)
(That soft, kind smile... It's the kind that tells you a pair of devil horns are not too far away...)
N-No, I wouldn't.
(Oh boy. Here comes her anger. ...And we were having such a civil conversation too...)
I-I didn't know that...
What do you think about this?
(Um, but this has nothing to do with your spiritual power...)
(Looks like there's no one here... And even though the weather is gorgeous today, it's raining inside my heart...)
That's the "Side Room". Looks like guests can use it as a place to take a break when they feel tired.
It's a really old urn. There are the ashes of a person long dead inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.
(The bedding is all laid out today too. Guess I'll leave them alone for now...)
It's still charming to see a real sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.
...Excuse me... ... (Who am I talking to? There's no one here.)
Hmm, I keep wondering about this box. I'm sure this wasn't here before the murder took place. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.
(Hey, there's someone by the incinerator... Ooh, looks like they've noticed me. And are now running at top speed towards me...)
Actually, it's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Nice to see you again.
So, what's up? You're all out of breath...
Excited?
Oh, really? For example...?
(All I see is an old, cracked piece of pottery...)
That's right... Pearls said she found this key inside the incinerator. I guess I should take a look inside for myself... ... Th-This... This is from Maya's costume...! There's blood on it... A tiny bit, but still...
So, this piece of cloth was burned in this incinerator. And this key was also found in there. Hmm, I get the feeling this incinerator plays a crucial part in this murder...
So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... "I AM"? Huh? Weird...
Is there some sort of legend connected with that urn?
Huh. Didn't know that.
...Um... "It's"...? What are you talking about?
Ami... Fey...? Who's that?
Um, you don't have to get upset with me...
Umm... Romantic, huh...? (If that urn is really as important as she says, it could be a vital clue...)
Ini, I want to ask you about the murder...
Dr. Grey's... Remember...? (As if there's another one?)
Well, that's not much help... Did you notice anything at all?
(Oh, yeah. You only introduced Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. No relation, sure. Even if you were only "acquaintances", that still means you knew him. Furthermore, your sister, who died in that accident, was a nurse at his clinic...)
Alright then. Why don't you tell me about your sister's fatal accident.
I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I have...
(...A... A Psyche-Lock!)
(Looks like I'm going to need something to pry her mouth open on this one...)
Um, about the accident, Ini...
No, I'm not.
(Guess I have no choice but to remove those locks...)
No way!
(She's stealing quick glances at the picture while smiling like a cheshire cat...)
(..."This"? What "this" is she talking about...?)
Yes. Her name is Pearl.
Oh, no, no, no. Maya is the next in line to be Master.
(...She looks so helpless...)
Um... Well... I found a few things...
I... I just need a little more time. It'll all come together by tomorrow, I promise.
So how was it? Today's trial, I mean...
Don't be silly. We have to concentrate on the trial. We're going to win this, Maya!
Of course not. You're completely innocent.
Well, did you check behind the folding screen?
Hmm... (That's exactly what Lotta said too...)
Yeah?
...Because of something Mia told me.
She said that spirit mediums can't have dreams. When you're channeling, it's impossible for you to dream because your soul leaves you.
You are not the real murderer. I think that... maybe before you even called the spirit, you were drugged.
I think this was planned from the very beginning. And you were set up to take the blame for killing Dr. Grey.
I want to ask you something about Pearls.
No matter what I try, she won't answer me. I want to know what she was doing at the time of the murder.
No, no, nothing like that...
I didn't really think she was the murderer. But... she's definitely hiding something.
You were with her on that day, right?
A ball, huh? (Sounds like a dead-end to me...)
So, about this ball...
She "loves to play with that ball", huh...?
The clothing box?
(The clothing box in the Side Room, huh?)
Th-That's not what I meant by it, but... I mean, I don't really think about it. I just sort of shove it in people's faces... Force of habit, I guess.
That's probably what it is.
... Um, instead of dwelling on the hole, let's focus on the fact that you weren't shot...
(I guess she didn't realize she was the one being shot at until now...)
This is the only one in the world, right?
I got it from Pearls.
Your sleeve? But how and when would your sleeve leave the room? It didn't grow a pair of legs...
It's alright. I'll buy you a new one, OK?
(Dammit! I upset her again...)
But that's not you!
Is not!
(I should've kept this picture to myself...)
Yeah, I know all about it. About how she's the founder of the Kurain Technique.
(...Trust me, this isn't going on my resume any time soon...)
I'm not too sure myself, but I found it just now inside the furnace.
That's not something I would know about... (I guess she didn't notice the bloodstain. Probably better that way...)
Huh? What are you talking about?
(Way to go Phoenix... Way to bring the mood down even further... *sigh*)
Looks like it.
("That person"...? Is she talking about "him"?) It's alright. We don't need to talk about that right now...
(Well, this murder will make you into a "legend", alright... Hmm... I probably shouldn't say that last thought out loud...)
Ah!
H-Hey! Wait! Please! Lotta! ... (She ran off into the manor...)
Lotta...
H-Hey!
(...*sigh*...)
Hey! Morgan!
Okay... Anyway, did you see Lotta come by here?
(Grr... Lotta! You sure know how to waste a man's time...)
I'm pretty sure I saw Lotta run in this direction... but it doesn't look like she's here...
It's Pearl's ball. Maya said that it's always kept in the clothing box... So then, what is it doing on the floor...?
It's the clothing box where Pearl's ball is usually kept. I wonder what's inside...
Whaaaa!? Wh-Wh-What were you doing in there!? What were you thinking!?
... (So you crawled into this clothing box because there wasn't a hole to crawl into? Oh man... ...Huh?) There's a small hole in this clothing box... And it's about... 8 inches off the ground! That's the same height as the hole in the folding screen! Then, could this...?
It's the clothing box where Pearls keeps her ball. I thought I felt my soul shake when Lotta jumped out at me. So it's big enough to fit a grown adult... Well, if she can be called an adult...
What person?
(Ah, she means Lotta.)
...I don't think that's quite what she meant.
O-Oh... Well, thanks.
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Pearl. You have to tell me what you were doing when the murder happened, OK?
Then I'll guess what happened. How does that sound?
You'll tell me if I guess something right, won't you?
Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right?
Leads to:
I'm pretty smart, Pearls. I know you were right here.
Huh? I'm wrong?
(Ooh, I feel a little warmer... from embarrassment. ...I'd better try again...)
You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way?
So? Do you think you can tell me now?
Man, oh man... Alright, what next...? OK, I think I know what you were doing there.
Well, I am a lawyer, you know. Now, what was it Pearls was doing in the Winding Way?
Leads to:
Pearl:
So?
Huh?
Sorry, I'll get it right this time...
You were... playing with this ball, right?
Maya told me that you love to play with your ball.
Un, huh. And then?
Something happened, huh? ...Something really bad...
This is it. While you were playing with your ball, this happened!
Leads to:
Pearl:
Were you so surprised that you were shocked into silence?
...Huh? (Way to embarrass yourself in front of an 8 year old, Wright...) Ah, sorry, sorry. Just see if you were paying attention... Ah heh heh.
This urn... It's a village treasure, right?
And the spirit of the founder of the Kurain technique is sealed in here, isn't it?
What's this? It's cracked all over, isn't it? There's even a few gaps here and there...
Pearl, you broke the Sacred Urn, didn't you?
The ball smacked into it and knocked it over, right? And if Morgan found out, she'd get really mad, huh?
(She doesn't seem to be fighting back... I think I hit the bull's-eye this time. But it's strange that the lock hasn't broken yet...)
Eh?
(Her voice is shaking...)
Leads to:
Pearl:
(*sigh* I figured...)
Yeah. (I'm sure I can get it if I think about it some more! The thing I'm missing... must have something to do with what's written on the urn...)
Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique?
That's right. And how do you spell her name? Do you know?
It's spelled "A-M-I".
I thought it was a little odd when I saw "I AM" written on this urn.
And that's how I knew that someone must have broken this urn. And made a mistake in spelling when they put it back together again...
And that's when you... broke the urn?
Don't worry. Morgan will never know, OK?
You thought you could put them back together, and no one would notice?
The hallway? You mean "Winding Way"?
Hmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job.
(So that's around when Lotta and I were coming back inside after reporting the murder.)
What is it, Pearls?
I really don't think that's going to happen. I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn.
(No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!)
M-Mia!
...You might get caught on film again...
Um, only a little. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand everything, piece by piece.
You mean like how did the real murderer get into the room and kill Dr. Grey...?
Which means that the murderer must have gone into that room before the channeling...
But Maya's already said there wasn't anyone else in there.
(Hmm...)
This case is all about spirit channeling. And I feel like I don't understand a thing about it...
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I've heard that name before...
Um, yeah...
(Are you saying that me being able to see you is just a fairy-tale too...?)
M-Mia!
Yes, Chief!
...Yes, Chief.
(Phew. I think I've found everything I can. But I can't see how they all add up... Hmm...)
(And is Ini Miney being here just a coincidence...?)
(How is it that the spirit Dr. Grey wanted to call just happened to be that nurse, and that nurse turns out to be Ini's sister... It's too... convenient...)
(I wish I knew a little more about Ini, but where am I going to find info like that?)
Aah! L-Lotta!
(I thought I heard a mosquito buzzing in my ear, although I couldn't understand a word...)
Um... Thanks...?
Wh-What are you going on about? And as for "following" or "chasing" or whatever it is, isn't that what YOU'RE doing!?
(You're not exactly the world's number one charmer either, sister.)
You hurt Maya really badly, Lotta.
Well, I guess. You did help Maya out too, after all.
Yeah, for real.
"I'm still..." what...?
?
Th-Thanks.
(Lotta not taking money? Now I KNOW this one's an alien clone...)
I'm not done...
And to think we trusted you, Lotta, and what do you do!? You stab us in the back! You stressed us all out and even gave Maya a few strands of white hair!
Now I'm going to have to pray she makes it, or she may come back as a ghost...
Everything?
(You were expecting me to pay you after what you did to us!?)
If Maya is not the real murderer, then... who do you think is, Lotta?
You mean Ini Miney?
(So, Lotta suspects Ini... Which means she might have already found some info about our mysterious Ini...)
Speaking of Ini, do you have any other information about her?
Well, what is it!?
(Oh, silly me. Here I thought "free" meant "no money necessary".)
Hospitalized...? But why?
Huh?
"Maybe"...? What's that supposed to mean!?
Aargh...
Spoiled gumbo sounds... Eww... I mean, look, don't blame this on... Oh nevermind! (Looks like I don't have much of a choice. Better go check out this "Hotti Clinic"...)
About this clipping...
(Nope, not an electron.)
(Oops, guess that was the wrong thing to show her...)
Mysterious!? All you managed to do was forget to focus your lens!
(Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?)
Y-Yeah...
Wh-What do you mean?
H-Huh!? Wait, wait, wait...
I don't think this has anything to do with how the world turns...
Yeah. I was wondering if you know anything about this girl...
Yeah, I had heard as much... I had also heard that Ini was the one to introduce Dr. Grey to Kurain Village.
I think if you got rid of your afro, I wouldn't recognize who you were.
(Please, can we get on with the important stuff...? Say, like the murderer...)
...Sorry, didn't hear you.
(...So, this is where Ini was hospitalized...)
Ah, yes... Are you a doctor here...?
(Ack! I didn't think I'd be speaking with the Director himself...)
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Ms. Ini Miney.
?
(Wow. I didn't think nurses could be this direct or forceful towards their boss.)
...
Um...
Don't "Hmm, yes" me. Who in the world are you?
...
(The nurse went off some-where... Oh the inhumanity. Only person I can talk to... ...is this guy... ...Uuuugh...)
This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients.
(What in the world did that have to do with anything...?)
(I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?)
H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!?
(There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...)
This patient is undergoing rehabilitation.
Hey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here!
This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's "Word to the Wise: Do something in vain, and your only reward is tiredness." Hmm, not exactly the best thing to be telling your patients, is it?
So, what exactly do you treat at this clinic...?
D-Doctory, clinical stuff?
...
You do surgeries here, right?
It... seems?
What do you know about Ms. Ini Miney?
From the general hospital...? To here? What kind of surgery did she need?
So what kind was it...?
(So you say with a happy smile on your face... "Mr. Director"...)
(I'm never going to get him to unzip those broken zipper teeth of his at this rate... There's got to be something I can show to this old coot...)
Please tell me what you know about Ini Miney.
What was she ill with?
A huge injury?
That sounds... pretty severe, alright...
Car...? ...You mean it was a traffic accident?
(...Dare I even ask what is wrong with this old guy...?)
Just now... You mentioned something about a big operation?
Y-Yes... Miss Ini's.
Was it really that bad...?
Picture...?
Oh.
(Um, breech [sic] of ethics...? ...Oh, wait...)
Um... Sure...
What happened to the actual license itself?
Um... So you "looked up" information on Ini's accident, correct?
What kind of accident was it, do you remember?
H-Huh? Y-You have it?
(Obsessive to the max... But I bet I could learn about how to stay on a lead from this guy.)
The passenger's seat, huh?
(A new clue! I should probably look this over.)
I'm a lawyer. Right now, I'm investigating a murder.
The trial is tomorrow. And I would really like some information from you.
What's that?
Are you kidding!? Anyone with half a fly's brain knew that!
(Do I have to explain this to him...?)
?
You mean "walking encyclopedia"?
...Yeah... How about you keep that kind of information to yourself...?
("Miss" Ini Miney?)
What do you think? Does anything grab your attention?
Umm, that's okay... (I don't think I should support his "research"...)
Y-Yeah, sure.
...I'll tell her for you...
So about this girl...
(...What is he talking about? What surgery...?)
Would you please take a look at this person...?
(Wh-Where does he think he is!? This is a medical facility!!)
So, about this girl...
(Um, Pearls is fine and well, although I feel sorry for the nurse now.)
About this person...
(...I don't believe this...)
This person...
...I... I was whipped by her... And it hurt... a lot...
(...I cried a little... I think...? I can't actually remember...)
...Ah, that's OK. I'll pass on this one...
Um, so what do you know about this...?
(...Attractive...? Huh?)
So, I'd like to ask you about this person...
(Even as a pretend doctor, he gets an F from me...)
(It's already been half a year, huh...?)
Y-Yes... Thank you very much.
(It's time for me to leave too, hmm, yes... Ack! OK, it's definitely time to leave!)
Yeah... I found out a few things... I guess...
...Huh? The cops? Why would Morgan call the police?
Well, I guess you could put it that way...
Yeah, what a mess. ... H-Hey, hold on!
That stuff you were just talking about... That's the first I've heard of it.
(Well, excuse me for not keeping up with gossip while I'm busy saving people!)
You said something about "stealing the Master's seat"?
(Morgan was supposed to become... the Master...?)
Do you know where Ini is, Lotta?
OK, thanks.
(Yeah. I've got a whole list of things only she can clear up for me...)
The oldest daughter...?
O-Oh?
(Come to think of it, Maya said the same thing a long time ago... She warned me not to take Mia's powers lightly...)
I see...
(Wow. I had no idea...) ...So what would've happened had Morgan been stronger...?
Yeah. (I think I have enough to finally unlock her secret...)
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Please tell me about the traffic accident.
Your sister's accident, naturally!
Hmm...
(Interesting... Ini just asked, "Whose accident?"... Which means... She must know something about another person's accident...) Alright, let's change the topic, then. How about you tell me about a certain other person's accident?
Leads to:
Ini:
You can't tell me you don't know.
Oh.
Alright, I get it. OK, then let's see if you know about this person's accident!
I want to ask you about your own car accident.
Yes.
Leads to:
Here is your proof.
H-Huh?
Ah, um, no... I didn't mean to suggest that...
(I thought I'd ease into this topic, but...) It doesn't matter what you say, I know you were in a car accident!
Would you take a look at this? It's a newspaper article from one year ago. It says, "Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash".
You suffered a very bad injury and had to be admitted to a hospital, correct?
What now?
Huh!?
What in the world are you babbling about!? Your sister's name, "Mimi Miney" is in here too!
(Y-You think I'm going to let you get away with that!?)
Leads to:
Ini:
...Truffling? (Um, "trifling", maybe?)
This is your proof.
I got this from the hospital where you were hospitalized at.
There was a certain patient there. He's quite a fan... As a memento of your stay, he stole this. I have to say, this photo looks like you.
Now are you ready to tell me about the accident...?
Actually, it is. Look at this article. It says that "one of the women died", correct?
That woman who died -- who do you suppose they mean?
Do you suppose the woman who died in that accident could be...?
Leads to:
Do you suppose it could be this person...?
...Huh?
(...Ack, I have to stall her!) W-Wait! Look, I think I know who it is!
I believe it was your sister, Mimi Miney.
You were riding in your sister's car while she drove. The two of you were together when your accident occurred, making it one and the same!
...And your sister...?
Oh, I'm sorry...
Did Dr. Grey really cause that accident by drugging your sister with sleeping pills?
(Hmm, I wonder... This does give Ini a good reason to want to murder Dr. Grey!)
What do you mean!?
What!?
...? Looks like something's up...
(...Poor Gumshoe... Being dragged off by the ear like that by Morgan... Owww...)
Pearls...
(Say something, Wright! Anything...! *sigh* I'm terrible at this.)
She'll be alright. I think I've gathered enough evidence...
Yeah, but... I can't just leave you here all alone, either.
(Her stare is really piercing... *shiver*)
Hey, Pearls... Could you take a look at...
(Aww... I can't do this to her now. She looks so pitiful and sad...)
Mia!
I think I have enough evidence and information now... I think...
(Hmm... If memory serves... Mia had a few Psyche-Locks of her own...)
Mia. I'm going to get the last piece of information I need.
Mia...
Mia... You know something, don't you? About the real murderer, I mean.
(It's really trying at times to be able to see other people's secrets...)
Yeah... (A battle of wits against Mia! ...*gulp*)
Mia, I want to help Maya any way I can. And to do that, I need to know who the real murderer is...
(This is it... The real murderer that Mia's been hesitant to name all this time!)
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Yes.
Leads to:
Um, I think you're trying to protect this person...?
I... I'm sorry.
(Mia's especially strict today...)
Morgan Fey, of course. There is no one else you would protect like this, Mia...
That's true...
My evidence is this black key.
At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden.
There is only one person who could have done that while I was busy calling the police. The person taking care of Maya -- Morgan.
What's that look mean?
Huh?
Long after...?
But that's...
Leads to:
Mia:
(I haven't even said anything yet...)
This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit.
I also found this in the garden incinerator. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood.
But this is what Maya told me.
Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume.
That just means someone changed her clothes.
I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that.
The proof is this piece of cloth.
I found it in the incinerator near the Winding Way. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood.
Yes.
That just means someone changed her clothes.
I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that.
What's that look mean?
Huh?
But... this blood...
Leads to:
Mia:
(I haven't even said anything yet...)
I think this is the proof you're looking for.
At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden.
And this is what Maya told me.
Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume.
Someone changed her into a different set of clothes. And then, burned the costume she was wearing in the incinerator. There is only one person who could've done that.
Exactly!
Um, I think this...?
You're really unforgiving today, Mia...
(Mia is really serious...)
Thank you.
H-However?
Yeah... She was with us the whole time...
How she did it, huh...?
Leads to:
... (No idea... Just throwing things out now...)
Yeah...
(So, if Morgan couldn't have done it herself... Then...)
...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.
...Were in cahoots!
...But Morgan already has an alibi...
But we have one big problem on our hands.
We don't have a motive.
Also, we don't really know for sure that she was cooperating with Ini.
(Mia doesn't have a clue either, huh?)
Huh!?
Um... because...?
Mother? Whose? Mine?
(Mia and Maya's mother? Why would she bring her up now...?)
R-Right, Chief! We won't lose!
No clues here.
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
Yeah?
Um, yeah. ...Why?
...Yeah, and I'm sure she felt a lot of pressure from her father's reputation.
(Um... But I think you're really strong too, Maya, for all you've gone through...)
Hey, Pearls...
Um, do you think you could do me a big favor? Could you channel Mia today too?
...Please. It's very important to me. I don't feel confident enough without her help...
Please, can you do this for us, Pearls?
...Phew, thank goodness.
This way, Pearls won't be able to see today's trial...
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(Uhh... It's true what they say... Women really are scary when they fight... *gulp*)
Wh-What!?
(Poor Mia... She seems really torn by this...)
Wh-What in the world could've...!?
Why have you hidden this until now!?
(Why is she making it a point to take a stab at me... Never mind.)
Just now, you said, "those two." Who were the two people you were referring to?
Um, Lotta's not a foreigner... despite how she talks...
(I can already see people in the heartland gearing up for a riot...)
Oh, uh, thanks.
Was it really necessary to have two people do something so simple as call the police? If there was a possibility of escape, then one of us should have stayed behind!
(I want to hear the end of that sentence...)
There was another reason you wanted both of us out of that room, wasn't there!?
You must testify! Why did you chase us out of the room!?
...!
(This is bad... Now people have a good impression of her and a bad one of us...)
(The last bit of her sentence sounds like a red herring... If that's the case, I'm not going to fall into her trap today.)
During our investigation, you stated that you struck the defendant on the head, and this strike caused Maya to lose conciousness. Do you stand by this statement?
...! B-But why would you lie about something like that!?
(She was... covering for Maya...?)
So, you were "covering for the defendant"!?
(Ugh... Why does it suddenly feel like there's a rock in the pit of my stomach...?)
(I'm sure Von Karma's allowing this testimony because it's advantageous to her... ...Which means I shouldn't press Morgan any further...)
Was it really that easy for her to escape from you?
But you are physically larger and stronger than the defendant. There is no way she could have escaped from you so easily...
...Ack!
But if she had run away, wouldn't you have given chase right away!?
You fainted...?
Is that because you were unconscious?
(Great, well, now what...?)
So while you were unconscious, you have absolutely no idea where the defendant went?
If that's true... then how can you know for sure that the defendant left the Channeling Chamber at all!?
What do you mean by that!?
(If she fainted, then there's no way she can testify any more than she has... If I press her, I'm not going to get anything useful anyway...)
Wh-What should we do...?
(Hmm... I hope this isn't going to come back and bite us in the butt...)
She... She went to speak with someone!?
I-Ini Miney...?
(For the love of all things good, Your Honor, have some spine... For my sake...)
(This... This testimony just now... Was it all made up? Was it just one huge lie...?)
...Mia! What do you mean?
Your Honor! There is room for doubt, so the defense will cross-examine this witness. We believe that our cross-examination will reveal the real truth behind this murder!
Was that because of your, um... sesame allergy, was it?
(...Am I the only one who missed the boat here...?)
Do you know the time?
E-Eleven AM...?
... Ah, no... I think you misunderstood me... I'm not asking what time it is now... I meant what time was it when the "someone" came into your room!
S-Sorry. My bad.
...
...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!?
... N-Never mind...
Are you absolutely sure?
You "guess"...? Was it or was it not your sister who entered?
(First off, my name is not Mr. Smith. Second, I'm an only child. ...Hmm, but more than that, she's managed to mess up the question with her answer...)
Th-The defense rests...
You were... happy in a sad way...?
But wouldn't most people react here with surprise at seeing a dead loved one alive again?
(Hmm... Should I drop this line of questioning...?)
(There's no need to press her over something this minor... I should be trying to find a more decisive problem with her testimony...)
So you really didn't think anything "strange" of the whole encounter?
But... OWW!
...You know the phrase, "Objection!"? Could you try using that once in a while...?
"Is it really that important?" Let me ask you: Is it really that important for you to ask?
Well, I don't think it's that important at all! Yeow!
It is very important! (Although I haven't quite figured out what "it" is yet. But I've got to bluff for now and make it seem like I know what I'm talking about...)
So, there was nothing odd at all about your sister's appearance?
(...Hmm...)
(Hm? ...Mia's talking to herself like she's found something wrong...)
(...?)
Leads to:
Something "terrible"? What was this thing she told you?
(Well, excuuuse me, Princess. ...Anyway, should I ask to hear the story again...?)
(I did just hear this story. It's not like my memory is that bad...) Actually, the defense is fine and does not need to hear the story again.
I'm sorry, but could I hear the story one more time?
(I know there has to be something here I can use... But where!?)
That was a very well-spun lie, Ms. Ini.
It's well constructed... but that's all it is.
Ms. Miney, may I remind you of what you said? You said that there was nothing strange about your sister's appearance.
But I don't really think you thought that at all. Take a look at this picture. This is a picture of the "sister" you met. I would think that even you would be surprised if someone like this appeared before you.
Ms. Miney! Why did you not include the blood you saw in your testimony!? If you were really testifying, and not lying, you would have noted it right off the bat!
Lots of people do that when they get on the stand, though.
(Ugh... The judge still looks a little shaken up... A lot of help he's going to be...)
...
Really? Because I thought it was pretty bright inside that room.
Um, excuse me, but how is my statement any more subjective than Ms. Miney's?
(Uuugh... Can't breathe... Let me outta here...)
You... didn't see the blood...?
But she must have had the gun with her at that time as well.
Are you going to tell me next that you didn't notice the gun either!?
And what was your sister, Ms. Mimi Miney, like at the time?
Did Mimi's spirit really say all that to you...?
And what was your sister, Ms. Mimi Miney, like at the time?
Did Mimi's spirit really say all that to you...?
May I ask you one more thing, Ms. Miney?
Was there anything you found strange, unusual, or just out of place?
Uh, when...? Um... When you...
I'm talking about when you were in the Side Room, of course!
(Hmm... What should I do...?)
Think harder! I know you can remember something!
(I wonder if I put too much faith in Ini's ability to do anything with that brain...)
(Even if I push her, this is probably a dead end... I should search for something stronger to hook her with.)
I'm talking about when you arrived at the Channeling Chamber, of course!
(Hmm... What should I do...?)
Think harder! I know you can remember something!
(I wonder if I put too much faith in Ini's ability to do anything with that brain...)
(Even if I push her, this is probably a dead end... I should search for something stronger to hook her with.)
I'm talking about when you were going to the Channeling Chamber, of course!
(She answered rather quickly... Now what...?)
(Even if I push her, this is probably a dead end... I should search for something stronger to hook her with.)
Think harder! I know you can remember something!
That's not good enough! You have to explain yourself clearly to this court!
...Actually, I really have no idea!
I ask because it is VERY important! (...Not that I know where I'm going with this...)
Was your sister calm by that time?
(She says with her whip at the ready...)
Was your sister calm by that time?
(She says with her whip at the ready...)
May I ask you one more thing, Ms. Miney?
Was there anything you found strange, unusual, or just out of place?
Uh, when...? Um... When you...
I'm talking about when you were in the Side Room, of course!

Try to remember that time!
(Hmm... I guess this really is a dead end...)
I've finally found the fault, or I guess in your case, the "crack" in your perfect lie.
Take a look at this urn.
There are cracks. Do you see them?
It looks like you still don't understand. I propose that if you had really been walking along the Winding Way at that time, there was no way you could not have seen this person!
Leads to:
Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger.
...As I thought, this is the wrong piece of evidence. Oww!
(Oww... So it's come down to a blunt "go home"...)
I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey.
It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden.
And she just happened to break this urn.
Yup. She accidentally knocked it over with her ball!
You say that you didn't see anyone on the way to the Channeling Chamber... However, that is impossible!
I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey.
It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden.
Yup! Which means anyone walking through the area would have to have seen her! So, Ms. Miney, what do you have to say to that!?
It's not preposterous, and I can prove it!
There is no way someone walking along the Winding Way could not have noticed Pearl!
Leads to:
Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger.
...As I thought, this is the wrong piece of evidence. Oww!
(Oww... So it's come down to a blunt "go home"...)
This urn is my proof.
Do you know why it's cracked? It's because Pearl broke it! That's why!
This urn was broken around the time the channeling started!
(No good. I can't find anything wrong...)
He'll end the trial... I know...
And Pearl was the one who put it back together... ...while sitting right in the middle of the Winding Way!
Ms. Miney.
Pearl was there, in the Winding Way at that time. She was hard at work, putting the pieces of the urn back together, you see. If you couldn't see that while you were walking, I'd have to declare you legally blind!
I think I have sufficiently proven one thing, Ms. Miney. You are a masterful liar!
The one who needs to watch what she's saying is the witness! So, Ms. Miney! Tell us the truth!
About what!? About where you really were at the time of the murder, of course!
(...Can I really believe her? Was she really sleeping in the Side Room...!?)
Yeah, I guess so. Sorry, my mistake.
Wh-What? Did I miss something again?
Huh? Why not?
It was Ini Miney, correct?
That's a pretty daring assumption...
Well, no, I guess not.
(Umm, this is bluff number...? We've done this so many times in this case I've lost count.)
Your lies end here!
The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room. And I say that's not possible, because there is clearly a contradiction here!
The answer is in the Court Record!
M-Mia!
A-Alright...
(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)
(Hmm, I may have overreached on this one... Is there really a contradiction somewhere...?)
Please, I need your help right now!
...Her words?
A-And what is that!?
(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)
(Hmm, it's "hard for me to see"...? I can't just accept her help without thinking it through myself!)
(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)
Earlier in your testimony, Ms. Miney, you made the following statement.
It's true that at the time, both myself and Ms. Hart were not there. We had gone to call the police.
It's very simple. Ms. Miney, how did you know that fact?
I concede that Ms. Fey was the only person in the Channeling Chamber. However, someone who was "asleep" in the Side Room could not have known that!
Which means, Ms. Miney! You did, in fact, go to the Channeling Chamber. However, you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way!
Yes, that's right, Your Honor. Which is why... Which is why I ask this very important question! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?
Ms. Miney! Please answer the question!
...!
Yeah!
Leads to:
She was here...
(...Oww... Sh-She slapped me on the wrist...)
Y-Yes, Your Honor... Sorry...
Ms. Miney was here, of course!
That's right! Ms. Miney was at the scene of the crime!
Simple. Ms. Ini Miney was hiding at the scene of the crime.
Leads to:
Ms. Miney was hiding here! Owww!
(Argh... Looks like I'm going to have to one up her!) Yeah, count on it!
Eh?... Oh, um, sorry, Chief...
Here, of course.
(Looks like the pipe's about to burst... Guess I should help it along...) The witness was hiding behind the folding screen... With the help of this!
Leads to:
Ini:
(What's with these two...? It's like they did a mind meld all of a sudden...)
Ms. Miney! How you were able to hide at the scene of the crime is very simple! You were hiding inside this box!
Sorry, but your theory has already been disproved. (Lotta disproved you when she was hiding from me in it.)
Hmm... It's kind of hard to prove...
Um... I guess by that look, there is a way to prove it?
(Guess I should take a look at the Court Record...)
P-Please wait... I said it was hard, but I didn't say it was impossible to prove!
And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove this clothing box was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!
Leads to:
Judge:
...Um... Your Honor...?
A-Alright...
Take a look at this clothing box.
Hmm, a hole about 8 inches off the ground. Where have we heard that before...?
That's right! I hope this has opened your eyes to what happened! At the time of the shooting, the clothing box was sitting behind the folding screen. Which is why the bullet from the pistol hit both the box and the folding screen! It went through the screen, and then into the box.
Ms. Miney! You were hiding behind the folding screen, waiting for your chance! Yes, for your chance to kill Dr. Grey!
That is exactly what I am saying! Ms. Ini Miney! You were hiding inside this clothing box all along! And you wore a medium's costume to masquerade as Maya Fey!
She had it planned from the very beginning! She would kill Dr. Grey, and pin the blame on my client!
I'm sure it's possible if you were to try! Ow!
Uh, I wasn't talking about that exact point... I meant, people, humans. If we want to do something bad enough, then...
(...Why... Why do you have to hurt me so...?)
Huh?
(... Ack! That's... That's right!)
It really is impossible. For one person to do all the preparations, that is. Owww!
W-Wait! Ms. von Karma... You said it was not possible for "one person", correct?
Ms. Miney! You had an accomplice!
Leads to:
Judge:
..."Too"?
O-Oh... Okay, I'll think more carefully this time...
If it wasn't someone from Kurain Village, you couldn't have gotten the costume. And if it wasn't someone from the Fey household, you wouldn't have that box to use.
What do you have to say to this, Ms. Miney!?
You shot Dr. Grey with your own two hands! Do you deny it!?
I think this is what really happened. The murderer had planted herself at the scene of the crime long beforehand. Dressed in a medium's costume and wearing a wig, she pretended to be the defendant. And then, the channeling started. The murderer crept silently towards the other two, both of whom had their eyes closed. ...First, she drugged Maya Fey with a strong sleeping agent. Then, she stabbed Dr. Grey with the knife! Next, she hid my client inside the clothing box... She did that so she could
Yes.
Dr. Grey was actually not yet dead! With the last of his strength, he fired a shot at his attacker! And that is why the hole in the folding screen was so low to the ground! The murderer then took the gun from Dr. Grey, and...
Yes, a gunshot is certainly something you wouldn't expect to hear. Which is why, upon hearing the shots, we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber.
Ms. Miney... She immediately covered her own costume with blood...
And pretended to be Maya Fey.
Which is precisely why Ms. Morgan Fey chased us out.
This is the real truth behind this murder.
Wh-What is it this time...?
WHAT IN THE WORLD!?
And that is...?
...Huh?
Eh? Well, that's... Uh...
A... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here! I have to think of a motive now! What is her reason for wanting Dr. Grey dead...?) The reason you wanted Dr. Grey dead is this!
Leads to:
Ini:
(...Ack! I've got to take my time and think carefully about this...)
(...Only one...?)
(Just great. Now even SHE is calling me by my full name...)
Yes! Because through that accident, you suffered a lot of hurt and pain yourself!
(She... She's back to her airhead self...!) H-However, you see-- Eeeowch!
Nnghuuurk! (Wh-What happened!? I thought I had her for sure!...)
...?
Mia...
...R-Really?
(...Can I... Can I really do this...?)
(I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...)
I will show and substantiate the fact that Ms. Miney had a motive!
...
I'm afraid so, Maya. There is no way Ini could've killed Dr. Grey by herself. And under the circumstances, there's no one else other than your aunt, Morgan.
Ack! Ms. von Karma!
Are you done yet? You've caused me enough pain and suffering.
...But even if you do that, it won't bring your father back...
Yes, Your Honor?
Yes, I believe I can. (Ini Miney and Dr. Grey have only one point of connection. And that is the car accident one year ago. The motive I'm looking for must be there...) Ms. Miney. Please testify to this court about your car accident last year.
It was all the talk on the tabloid shows, day after day, last year.
Yeah... Which means I'll have to work this from another angle.
Didn't some sort of medical malpractice happen at your sister's hospital then...?
Two accidents back to back... Do you assume it's just a coincidence?
That was the malpractice incident where 14 patients died, correct?
What was the cause of the mistake?
Was that the fault of your sister, Mimi Miney?
(Which means as far as the "real" facts are concerned... Mimi Miney is the one who made the mistake...)
She was "totally tired"? You mean, exhausted?
It's no wonder, then, that the car accident happened, huh?
(There's no point in asking her about her sister. I should be trying to find out more information about Ini!)
So then, why didn't you ask to switch places?
I meant switch drivers. If your sister was so tired, then you should have switched with her.
Your sister... Mimi miney, was she that exhausted?
The accident happened at night, correct...?
And your sister? What happened to her?
Please tell us about your escape in more detail.
(Hmm, if it's that article, then I've already got it...)
And that's why you were in the passenger's seat?
I see...
Y-Yes?
Leads to:
(There's got to be some sort of secret sleeping in this testimony...)
Ms. Miney. That was a lame lie just now.
I know you had a license back then! This is a photo you took for the express purpose of getting a driver's license!
No, you had it. You had it at the time of the accident! Director Hotti... or the guy pretending to be him anyway, said so!
Yes, that perverted fake clinic director. And how did you know he was perverted. Eowch!
What? N-N-November...?
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What in the!?
Uuuuurk... OW!
(...Hmm...) Yeow!
Not you too, Mia! With the whip... And the pain... And the oww...
(Hmm... I'm not terribly knowledgeable about cars, but...)
So what do you mean by, "really close"?
Um, "permit"?
Well, this lawyer never had a permit. Wah!
(What is with her...? All she's said in the last few minutes is utter nonsense...)
She "valued" cars? How much would you say she valued her car?
(In that case, why bother taking the car out of the garage, ever!?)
Why did she take such special care of the car?
...New car?
(I would think that cars getting dirty is just another fact of life, but... I guess people who really love cars think otherwise...)
(I guess I just don't get what's so special about cars...) Alright, then, please testify about your sister's car.
It was a new car...?
(I guess her love of cars would be the obvious next topic...)
(But I really don't know anything about cars... But I had a feeling this was bound to come up!)
I see... Please continue...
Mia... I had no idea you liked cars so much too...
O-Oh, yeah!
Your Honor!
Please append what the witness has just said to her testimony!
Yes!
That's not my point! (Though to be honest, I don't know what the point is either...)
... (I yelled, "Hold it" pretty forcefully, but... I don't actually know what to ask about cars...)
Um... So, yes... (What am I supposed to pick for a topic...?) Let's start with this. Why are British cars good?
They're expensive, and their driver's seat is opposite to our cars here in the States. It would seem there is no benefit to owning one.
This whole steering wheel on the right side thing; it's kind of goofy, isn't it?
Uuugh... Forgive me... (Her personality really changes at the drop of a hat...)
(I really stink at talking about cars... If I ask the wrong question, I might make someone mad...)
Leads to:
Was your sister good at driving?
(...Somehow, I think she bumped my question off-track again...)
And that was when the accident occurred, correct?
Leads to:
D-Do you really think so?
(Hmm... Mia almost sounded like a prophet for a second there...)
Ms. Miney. Do you remember this article?
It's an article about the accident. You had said this in it: "But I opened the right door, and, like, got out"... That's correct, isn't it?
Your Honor. Which side is the passenger's seat: the left or the right?
That would be if it were an American car. But it would be the opposite in a British car.
The two of them were riding in a British car! In that case, the passenger side would be the left side!
Ms. Miney! You said that you had escaped using the right side door of the car! But if you were sitting there, then that means you were in the driver's seat!
That is what Ini said, yes But that is where her story falls apart. Somewhere, all of us made a big error in our assumptions!
If we connect all the dots, there can only be one answer! I'd like to ask the court a question. Ini or Mimi -- who was really driving that night?
And the answer is Ini Miney, of course!
Ms. Ini Miney just said so herself in her testimony! She said that she escaped the car from the right side door! Which would have been where the driver's seat was! Owwwww!
And that is why the accident happened!
Th-The "real truth"...?
(A-Alright, one more time...!)
The answer is the one person who had her driver's license, Mimi Miney. After all, that makes her the only person who could legally drive!
Which leads us to the next question...
Who is the person standing on the witness stand right now?
I'll tell you what her name really is. This witness' real name is...!
Leads to:
Judge:
Umm... Phoenix Wright... Your Honor.
Wait a second... I screwed up didn't I?
A-Alright, I'll give it another shot!
Mimi Miney. That is your real name.
When she was admitted into the hospital, this witness was suffering severe facial burns. So for the purpose of facial reconstruction, they used a picture.
This is the picture she gave to her doctors at the time. That's right! It's a picture of her younger sister!
That's what everyone thought. However, that was not the case.
That was the body of the real Ini Miney. Isn't that right... Ms. Mimi Miney!?
(That car accident one year ago... The one who died that night was Ini Miney. Her sister, Mimi, then stole her face... And was reborn as Ini. With this, she effectively erased "Mimi Miney" from existence!)
Dr. Grey wanted to call back the spirit of a dead person. Specifically, the spirit of his nurse that died in the crash, Mimi Miney. However, that would not have been possible! Because "Mimi Miney" was still, in fact, alive! And that fact would have been discovered had the channeling been conducted. So this witness had to stop that from happening... ...at all costs!
Yes. Before the channeling, Dr. Grey had the misfortune of consulting this witness about communicating with the dead. And in that moment, his fate was sealed!
...!
(I think I understand why... Mimi Miney wanted her self to disappear because of this...)
von Karma:
Dr. Grey was right. The mistake was caused by the nurse. A nurse by the name of Mimi Miney. That's right, the person standing before us today. And a few weeks after this mishap, Mimi Miney had a car accident, in which she lost her younger sister.
Fourteen patients dying in that incident, and her own sister's life, extinguished. It was all too much to bear.
She lost everything in the flames of that accident, her sister... ...and even her own face. This was her last chance... Her chance to throw away her past and start a new life as her "sister"...
Mia:
Huh?
(Looks like this wasn't the right piece of evidence after all... I guess I don't fully understand this case yet...)
...Mumbo-jumbo?
The innocence of the defendant, Maya Fey...
I'm going to enjoy the news tonight, Ms. von Karma. How about you? It's going to be broadcast all over the world, right? Your defeat, that is... Yeow!
Owowowowwwowoowowowowwowwwowwowwwooowowwooowowowoowooowowowoowooww
Hmm... There is still one thing I don't quite get.
What would've happened if Mimi hadn't shot Dr. Grey...? I mean, we broke in because we heard a gunshot.
She had it planned down to the smallest detail, huh...?
Congrats, Maya.
Well... you know...
...?
...
Maya, it's over. Why don't we just let it be.
(The reason Morgan helped Mimi with her plan was...)
Maya:
Four years from now, a new Master will be "born" into Kurain Village. And that person will be you, Maya.
But, if you weren't there... then the main family's blood-line would disappear... And what would happen then...?
...No, Morgan's spiritual power is too weak. The next person would be... Pearls.
Everything was done for her sake. It was all so that Pearls would become the next Master.
(...? Did Maya say something just now...? I think that she was saying... "I thought so"...)
Maya:
Yeah, me neither. Even I don't really know why Morgan cooperated with Mimi Miney...
Look, this whole thing is over now, so let's not dwell on the past, OK?
(I just don't know the answer to this one... I'm just as confused about the situation as she is... So why the "thanks"?)

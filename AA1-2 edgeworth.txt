The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.
The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.
And the cause of death?
Now, Detective...
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
You said it.
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!
Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.
Detective Gumshoe.
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?
Hah! Forgot, you say?
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Detective Gumshoe.
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!
Witness, your name, please.
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?
Well, Your Honor?
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
You looked out the window. What did you see next?
And the person attacking her?
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.
Please, continue your testimony.
Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!
The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!
You have proof that she could not?
Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.
The prosecution denies your request!
This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!
Tsk tsk.
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...
W-what!?
Ho hoh!
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)
Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!
... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!
What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.
Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
WHAAAAT!?
The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?
I object to calling the bellboy!
Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.
If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.
Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.
Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!
"I object! That was... objectionable!"
I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!
Oof! Y-you fool!
Who! Who is this "other person"!
Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!
Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!
I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!
Oof!
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.
Innocent...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.
Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.
...
I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!
Please state your full name.
Er... your name?
Name!
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?
And you witnessed the murder from there?
Tell us, what were you doing at the time?
We see. Continue.
And what did you do then?
Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.
Are you sure?
Bwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!
Eh...? And that is?
Hah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!
What!?
Yes, what do you mean, he was not "viewing the crime from the hotel"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?
M-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?
Impossible! There was no one other than the criminal and victim in the room! There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None!
Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!
The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!
The prosecution requests that the defense refrain from interrupting the testimony!
Mr. Wright! If you claim that it was NOT you, then show us proof!
The witness is obviously confused, Your Honor! I would like to request a 10 minute break!
Your Honor! Please, I ask that you do not allow the witness to be badgered any further!
I see nothing odd about the witness knowing the name of the victim. Mr. Wright! I will not have you harrying the witness!
Mr. White, please try to remain calm. Mr. Wright here is only trying to fluster you with baseless accusations!
That's far enough, Phoenix Wright!
Mr. White...
I think the time has come. Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?
I said, you should confess your crime. Ergo, confess that you placed the wiretap!
Distinguished members of of the court... Mr. White is slightly confused. Allow me to explain.
As you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.
Your Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?
Mr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?
Gladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: At the very moment of the murder! Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!
However! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! He went to place the wiretap! He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!
Miss April May knew the details of Ms. Fey's phone conversation! This proves that the wiretap was placed before the murder!
Unidentified fingerprints several days old were found in the Fey & Co. Law Offices. Those were obviously Mr. White's.
Now, Mr. White. Tell us why you went to the Fey & Co. Law Offices.
That has no bearing on the current case, Your Honor.
Tsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably.
Your Honor. There is nothing to go back to! The cross-examination of Mr. White is finished! All that is required now is for you to pass judgment on the defendant Phoenix Wright!
I say... let us give Mr. Phoenix Wright his "last chance."
Miss April May knew the details of Ms. Fey's phone conversation! This proves that the wiretap was placed before the murder!

Bwah hah! You're grasping!
Th-the other side?
Not so fast, Phoenix Wright!
There is a certain thread of logic to the defendant's claims. However! There is no concrete proof that Phoenix Wright is innocent!
Ergo! I would like to request one more day before Phoenix Wright is granted his freedom. I need time to make one more inquiry into this matter.
If anyone is going to call Mr. White to trial, it would be me, the prosecution. I need a day to ascertain whether your claims have any basis in factual evidence!

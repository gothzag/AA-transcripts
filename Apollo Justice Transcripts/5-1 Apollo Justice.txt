Oh, yeah? Well, that's good to hear. Although... I could've sworn I heard your voice crack for a second there.
I'm just happy that you're okay, Athena. Although... I can't pretend I have no connection to this case. That's why I'm gonna see to it that Juniper's name is cleared! And I'm sure you feel much the same way.
Yeah... that's right. Come what may... this is one trial... we just can't lose...!
Ungh...
*huff, huff*... Aaaaargh! I... I have to... defend Juniper!
Huh...? What are you gonna do?
You're not seriously--
All by yourself?! Athena, stop for a sec and think about what you're saying! You've never once taken a case on alone before, right?!
............
............ ...All right. I can see your mind's made up anyway. I hate it that I can't be there... but I know you'll give your utmost to defend Juniper!
Sorry, but I'll be taking a leave of absence.
I can only say... that this is something I must settle on my own.

You've already watched it five times! Let's watch something else now!
What's so "therapeutic" about watching a killer whale?
You're kidding. That kind of thing really exists?
Work? But we've already cleaned the toilet... Twice. Each. ...Hey, wait a minute. Is that your badge I see?
Gee, Mr. Wright... With that badge on, you suddenly look so... capable!
But what made you suddenly so fired up to get your badge back, anyway?
What could be so important...?
Isn't that the aquarium we were just watching, Athena?!
If there's anything you need, all you have to do is ask!
Wait a minute... Don't tell me she picked you all because of a bad pun...
And I'll go, too!
How come I'M the one who has to stay behind?!
The murder of the owner of Shipshape Aquarium? ............Gah. I can't think with you looking at me so expectantly. I don't really have any ideas. Sorry I'm not any help.
Are you two making fun of me?
Well, I think you should give that Swashbuckler video a glance.
It's not so much that... I just thought it might give you some leads, seeing as it's the scene of the crime and all.
I've got nothing better to do, so maybe I'll watch it a few times myself.
The return of a legendary lawyer! It's kind of exciting.
Wow! You present that thing like a real pro! You must've done it a thousand times.
I get wanting to show it off. When I first became a lawyer, I flashed that badge left and right!
What's this? Something you wear around your neck?
What am I, some kind of circus animal to you two?
Need I remind I'm a lawyer?! Besides, Athena doesn't know any tricks!
Well... that's, uh, really something, Athena...
Evidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?!
Oh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think.
Fish? I haven't had fish for a while, come to think of it... ...The obvious question, though, is "What are you doing with a bunch of raw fish?!"
Penguin?! So why are you giving it to me to cook?!
Then why don't we all go out for sushi when you wrap up the investigation?
...Why did I even open my mouth?
Did you... lose the case?
Huh? Then why are you so dejected?
What?! Picking on the new kid? Not cool, Mr. Wright. Not cool...
So what are you two going to do now?
If there's anything I can do to help, just say the word!
...I meant, anything I could do as a lawyer...
Great job, Trucy. You never fail to impress. I have no idea how you did that, either.
How is the investigation going, Mr. Wright?
I see...
If you have anything for me to do, I'd like to help, too.
Well, I'll be right here... hanging around watering Charley... if you think of anything!

Athena already made me watch it so many times, I remember the whole show.
I bet Trucy would like it.
Magician versus pirate, huh? That would be one wild show, I bet.
Evidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?!
Oh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think.
You bet I would! What do you want me to work on?
Okay... And it's suddenly crickets...
You have work for me?! What is it?
Sure thing, Mr. Wright! I'll go to a hospital or something and have somebody take a look. Let's see... I'm pretty sure the closest one is Hickfield Clinic.
Oh, you're back! How is the investigation going?
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
Mr. Wright! I went to Hickfield Clinic!
S-Sorry about that! Anyway, I found out a lot, so I wanted to tell you right away! It turns out that mysterious capsule is a powerful sleeping drug. Apparently, the brand name is "3 Zs."
And they said the Shipshape Aquarium vet recently bought a large quantity from them!
"3 Zs" is supposed to be for people. But Dr. Crab told them it would work on other mammals, like orcas and dolphins, too.
And I found out more than just about that capsule! Dr. Hickfield himself gave me some information. Shipshape Aquarium had someone on their staff named Azura Summers, right?
Well, Azura Summers was getting a certain medication from Hickfield Clinic last year... ...the same heart medication as Sasha Buckler!
Okay. Trucy and I will be here!
I saved you all seats, Mr. Wright!

Yeah... uh, I'm kinda busy.
......
Ow ow ow! What? What!? ...I was writing about our last case in my journal.
Hey, it's a long story. ...I did a lot, you know. I want to vacuum pack the feel of the moment for later. Right now I'm wowing the crowd by figuring out how Lamiroir disappeared.
*sigh*... I was just getting to the good part. (I suppose I should watch a little TV with her. After all, her father's expecting me to look after her while he's away...)
The Sunshine Coliseum? Hey, that's where the Gavinners concert was!
(The legendary Gramaryes... ...If Trucy's real father were still alive... ...he'd be on that stage performing miracles.)
(Not exactly the kind of greeting I'd want to hear from my own kid. Though he has been gone a long time.)
So, you still can't tell us what your "mission" is?
Huh? With... me?
(Can't I just be a defense attorney...?)
What...?
Huh? Uh... Maybe?
(The "Jurist System", huh?)
There's quite a few magic books in there, too, you know.
(For a moment, I thought Mr. Wright might do magic, too... A scary thought.)
Not really. It's just the only thing in here that doesn't have some secret function.
Not really.
(Really, I wasn't.)
No, no, I was just touching it.
Yoooooowwwwwwwwch!
The human body wasn't meant to bend like that!
I can't believe you're using this cutting-a-person-apart box as... shelf space.
...You should really examine your props before the show.
That magician in the photo, is that your...?
...I see. (She's smiling, but I'll bet that smile doesn't go very deep...)
(No one's practicing the piano, as usual. Even calling him a pianist is an insult to pianists everywhere.)
Huh? What, was I making a funny face or something?
There's no "of course" about it! You guessed wrong. ...Besides, that's not what I'm thinking... it's what you're thinking!
At least you've got that pudding.
...Try not to eat my share, will you?
That hat... Is that a spare? It looks exactly like the one you always wear.
Or... like fingerprint powder.
A plate of plastic spaghetti for displaying in a shop. ...Where the heck does she get this stuff?
...Um, why not get a more sturdy table?
...There's no "maybe" to this. That thing is a deathtrap.
...Only from TV. It's twelve people, chosen from the community, right?
Ah, and there will be only six of them under the current proposal, right?
(Mascot...? Hey!)
So... What is this secret mission?
Uh, I'm not that bad. Am I?
Helping... how?
(Once a lawyer, always a lawyer, I guess.)
Huh? Oh, right. The card tricks.
...So what, that's three whole days from now.
Have fun.
Riiight!
But... what about the "secret mission"...?
(I don't trust that smile. He knows something that he's not telling me.)
(*sigh* I suppose it wouldn't kill me to pop over there.)
(I'm glad I provided this opportunity for a little family bonding.)
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
Ready? For what?
I-It's not like I'm getting up on stage or anything...
Huh? You mean, I can't go in this?
(...Doesn't get more straightforward than that.)
(Why try to fight it? I can't win...)
So... what kind of case is the trial simulation about?
That's not simple at all!!
Um... with what?
Yeah, but there's still a verdict to be decided.
Ack! You mean... the verdict's for real!? That's not a "test" trial! That's a... real trial!
Wh-Why am I only hearing about this now!?
Eh...?
Alright, so what case are you going to use?
Of course I do! I mean... I'm going to be defending, aren't I?
There's a difference between having a blank slate and just being totally clueless. Who's [sic] dumb idea was that anyway?
Oh...
Good! That's better.
What!? Then how am I supposed to defend...?
But you don't want it to backfire, do you?
...!
A... Alright.
But you just said I couldn't talk to anyone involved...
Huh? Today? Um... I think it's "Recycle Your Plastics" day...
(I've given up trying to understand them. It's much easier that way.) ...So what is it?
(...Because that would be the logical thing to do.)
An envelope about the Gramaryes, huh? Hmm...
Ah, lookey here. A handwritten signature. It says... I can't read it.
Isn't enough if you can read your own?
......
That's 20 minutes we've been waiting here! 20 minutes!
You know the minute we get angry, the client will show. It always works that way.
Wh-Wh-Where'd you come from!?
W-W-W-Well... ...Anyway! Please have a seat!
It's the silence. It builds suspense. Why don't you do something, Trucy? You're a magician, aren't you?
Hmm. Ms. Magic Underwear might have been a better bet.
The security camera stares down from the ceiling, all-seeing, unblinking. Not that I'm nervous or anything.
The same old security guard is glaring at us. ...He winked. Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all.
Um. Uh. Hi! Well, I'm your defense... ...I really think it has to be fate, you know!
And by fate, I mean destiny! Did you know I'm good with astrology? Tell me, what's your sign?
...No, never mind. I just got carried away there. (I seem destined to get difficult clients, it seems.)
Um... So, what's your name?
Oh, right, I'm supposed to introduce myself first! I'm Apollo! Apollo Justice!
...I know. (This is getting nowhere fast.)
Hey, I know! Maybe you can tell us what happened? I'm your defense attorney, after all!
Um, anything out of the ordinary happen lately?
...Later, Trucy. (I feel like I need to ask directions myself here...)
Um, see this here?
Um, does it ring any bells?
(Does anything I say ring anything?)
(Well, that was fruitless. Though I think I understand despair a little better now.)
What? Are nails more important than defense? Is that it!? ...Let's go, Trucy.
...!
Um, sure.
(I feel like a teenager on a first date! And this is the love letter we passed from desk to desk at school...)
It... It's a business card. With a name and an address. The name is... Vera Misham? The address is for "Drew Studio".
And you're giving me this card because...?
...... Well, looks like we're finished here.
Let's go find out.
And on the back... Hmm. Just her name.
Huh? What does?
That's not a bad idea, actually.
(...She's drawing something. Hey! My hair's not THAT spiky!)
Yes, that's right!
Most. Annoying. Client. Ever.
Wow, this looks like... it looks like a studio.
Yeah... Looks like we found our crime scene...
Hey, don't touch those.
...Looks half finished. (You can still see the rough sketch underneath.)
Yeah, good point. (That is odd...)
You know about the trial simulation tomorrow?
We don't even know what the case is about.
Yeah... We just saw her at the detention center.
(We can't talk to anyone related to the case this time around... ...Which means we'd better find out as much as we can here at the scene. ...Or else.)
I would hope so.
What do you mean?
Huh? Whaaaat?
There's quite a bit of paint on the ground.
...Hey, you're right!
You certainly seem pleased by the possibility.
That's hardly something to get mad about... ......
Well, doesn't this painting look like... never mind.
(I'd better get a professional opinion on this...)
Well, doesn't this painting look like... never mind.
(I'd better get a professional opinion on this...)
Let's take a look... Empty.
...These paints are all dry. I'm just surprised at how different these all are.
It must have been a work in progress. You can still see the rough sketch below...
I noticed. (That is weird...)
This painting here looks like a work in progress.
I know. (Very peculiar...)
It certainly is a bit curious. (...And a whole lot of suspicious.)
Did the police already analyze this cup, too?
(So the killer was after Drew Misham alone.)
(Why would a painter need a drafting table? Was he an architect, too?)
Why would a painter need all this?
(This corner doesn't fit with the rest of the studio.)
...This is a crime scene, Trucy.
Let's take a closer look at this desk here.
This envelope has been opened and resealed.
Whoever did this wasn't so delicate.
(Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.)
This envelope has been opened and resealed.
Very strange... (Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.)
Isn't that a pen? Like an old-fashioned quill pen?
(...Exactly what about that was "bold" or "scientific"?)
Hmm. Something about the way that figure is posed...
Please, I am a professional. (...I wonder why it's posed like that? Coincidence?)
Is this... a journal?
......
...It's new. He didn't write a single line.
So this is Drew Misham?
Until you arrested his daughter.
Uh huh. Right.
Tiny is right. That thing's barely two inches high. What picture would fit in that?
(There's no glass in it, either. What's it doing sitting on the desk?)
I wonder why there's poison on this tiny frame.
I don't think they sell that kind anymore. And the poison was atroquinine, anyway. (A tiny, mysterious, poisoned frame...)
That'll be enough of that, thanks.
(Huh? So it was a standalone painting or something? Is that what she means?)
Letters? Do people still write letters?
I mean, when was the last time you wrote a real letter? Don't most people use e-mail and stuff these days?
...The "suspect", please.
Could you tell us a bit more about what happened the night of the murder?
So, this woman, Vera... She's Mr. Misham's daughter, right?
That... does sound like a scene.
(...Why can't I ever get a normal client?)
So, about the poison... It was found to be in his coffee, right...?
(It means "see for yourself", I think.)
And it just so happened that he died the night of his first interview...?
Wait, but why is she the suspect? If anyone is suspicious, it's the reporter!
(Regardless, I want to know more about this "reporter".)
So, about the reporter...
(I bet Ema could help us out here...)
Well... I was thinking. I mean, what is it we always do when we run into you at a crime scene? What is it we always do... scientifically?
OK... meaning we can get erm, scientific now?
Ema, about this painting...
Er, that's not what I wanted to ask you about.
(...I guess she wants us to do a little footwork on our own first.)
Oh, Ema, I was wondering about this painting here...
"What about it"!?
Take a closer look at it, both of you. Now... look at this one. This is the third painting he was working on.
(Copying a painting...? What for?)
So, Ema, about this coffee mug...
...I suppose you are the detective here.
Let's check out this mug, shall we?
Um, Ema, about this mug... ...there's a pale blue, uh, "residue" on the rim.
I'm pretty sure it isn't actually blue, Ema.
So, the poison that killed the victim was on this mug?
(It certainly is helpful... Maybe Ema'd be willing to help us out a bit more...)
(It's certainly worth talking to her a bit more.)
Ema, about this...
(She sure is jumpy...)
Y-Your "lips are sealed"...? (That's a first!) You mean... you know what's inside the envelope?
(But she did sneak a peek at it, apparently.)
(Tools I wouldn't mind getting my hands on...)
(Never heard that one, but it's good advice... Let's try talking to her some more.)
Oh, right. Sorry.
Ema, I was wondering if you could take a look at this...
(Somehow I knew she'd get around to science.)
Well, what do we have here...? It looks like a person... thinking about something.
...Maybe that's what this person's thinking about.
Is that... a pufferfish?
...They're not the same thing?
(...Must remember to keep Trucy away from small, round fish.)
Oh. Looks like it was only half-completed.
...They do, actually! (What's that all about...?)
Huh? Really!?
...That might possibly be the strangest thing I have ever heard.
Something tells me that even Blue Mountain Coffee isn't THIS blue. No, this stain is probably... (Hmm, better ask Ema.)
...You're right. I wonder if there's some way we can see what's inside?
Let's not tamper with the evidence, shall we? I've got a better idea...
Um, about poison analysis...
(...Uh oh, I know that spark in her eyes. She's getting excited. Best tread lightly.)
Th-That's fine, really. We don't need to know all the gory details.
Aaaaugh! What are you doing!?
How's this for a reaction: Never do that again! I'm not poisonous!
(Let's just get down to checking for real poisons, shall we?)
I'm sure Ema checked out all the likely spots. ...Wait a second.
Did you spray that little desk over there?
Let's check it out, just to be sure.
(Never mind that I was the one who found it.)
(Why would the inside of that frame have poison on it? ...It looks like we found the only other place that was poisoned, in any case.)
Why not? Just to be sure.
(I bet she spends it all on Snackoos.)
Yeah.
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Look, I know! I meant I won't lick it!
(...The concern is touching, really. Next thing you know she'll be telling me not to drink coffee before bedtime...)
Hmm... Looks like you have to take this back part off first to put a photo inside.
True. And that pale bluish stain... Why would there be poison in a place like this?
That's not very obvious, Trucy.
So, Ema, I was wondering... What's the story about this reporter that came here for a story the night of the crime?
About that envelope we found... ...I was wondering if you could help us out with that "tool" you were mentioning?
Yeeeeargh! What are you doing!?
Point that thing at me any more, and it might all fall out.
(Let's just get down to business, shall we?)
...I don't see anything.
Except... I can't read them.
I'm not entirely following you, but what good is it if you can't read anything?
Well, it's Ema's ticket. Let her buy another one.
Why all the secrecy, though? And...
...Why was this letter the only one in here? ...It's seven years old, right?
(She knows something she's not telling us. ...Looks like she's keeping mum about it.)
(I don't think his paintings are worth THAT much. Something's not right here.)
So, Ema, I was wondering... What's the story about this reporter that came here for a story the night of the crime?
So a reporter comes for an interview with a painter. His first interview ever, and that night, he's killed. Seem strange to you?
I'd like to speak with this reporter if I could.
Magician...? (Well, if it's not Trucy, that leaves only one other person.)
(So, he's out interviewing Valant Gramarye... Looks like I'll be heading out to that coliseum again sooner than I thought.)
Really. What's this... a camera lens finder?
I guess if he's freelance, he'd have to.
Why don't I become a rock star too, while I'm at it?
Just a while ago it was the place where murder and nightmares converged.
(What about the case...?)
(Humility is definitely NOT one of his stronger traits...)
(Yeah, yeah, you're amazing, we get the picture.)
...Hey, that creature there. He was handing out balloons during our last case, too.
Oh, sorry. Was I mean somehow?
Kind of takes the fun out of seeing the Blue Badger.
You know, I thought this at the time of the Gavinners's concert, too, but... ...this coliseum is just way too big. It's huge.
Don't tell me. You're going to make the coliseum disappear, right?
(Oh. Oops. Looks like I was right.)
It was just a wild guess, really.
With the Gramarye seal on it, no less.
(They both sure seem excited about it. I guess it's a big deal for magicians.)
They've changed the sign since our last case.
I hope nothing bizarre and mysterious happens this time.
I don't have a problem with mystery as long as it's legal.
(She really is looking forward to this, isn't she.)
(I'm guessing that memory was a bit embellished.)
Um...
If the world was waiting, why did you hold off for seven long years?
...I have, though I'm not sure it qualifies as "magic".
("Seven years"... That phrase sure likes to pop up, doesn't it...)
Intellectual property, maybe?
You mean... him!?
(I think I see where this story is going...) Once a person is classified missing for a certain period of time... ...they're considered legally deceased, correct?
Yeah. It's called "death in absentia". He's declared missing... permanently.
Just now...
That incident?
(The detention center...?)
Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about this?
("Lord Daddy"? That's kind of stretching the whole archaic thing a bit...)
...I-I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that!
(What's in this envelope, I wonder...?)
No means no! Trucy's father didn't want us to open it yet.
(...What could be in this envelope...?)
So, a journalist was here on a story?
He doesn't look too happy about it.
(He really didn't like that guy, did he?)
Ack! N-N-No thanks! (Are all magicians like this?)
I was just thinking how hard it is to get any information out of a magician.
Uh, sure...
Is he going to fix the card? (Not sure that qualifies as "big" magic...)
(He must have really not liked that journalist...)
What do you think that journalist was after? And why did Valant react like that to this envelope?
Workers are busily preparing the coliseum for the magic show three days from now. Maybe we should go check it out... once this case is solved.
A hot air balloon. You hardly see those anymore these days. It kind of reminds me of when I was a kid. Maybe Valant's playing the nostalgia card to drum up interest in the show.
That was a Gavinners sign last time, wasn't it? I hope nothing strange happens this time around...
...Looks like someone's already meeting here.
Ah, sorry, we didn't know someone was already here. I'm Apollo Justice, attorney at law. (Talk about a nervous monkey.)
You... know me?
Th-That's not true! (What's he writing...?)
...I should've guessed.
(What's that nauseatingly strong mint smell every time he grins?)
...I can see that. (He's writing something again! Well, if he's a reporter, maybe he knows something...)
(...Huh?)
(*sigh*)
(I think I may have actually understood that one.)
I don't think so!
(What could he possibly be writing? He didn't listen to a word I said!)
Right. Guess we'll leave then.
An oil painting...?
(Someone stole an oil painting... of a giant peach.)
Actually, there was one thing I wanted to check with you.
(And what's with the "I know something but I'm not telling" face you've got going, Ema?)
This painting... came from behind that dresser.
...It was stolen, no?
Do you think you could tell us a bit about this?
Ema... about this painting from behind the dresser there.
I see.
What do you mean?
(I get it now...)
(True... That would be interesting. And maybe valuable for our case.)
(...Hmm, maybe I should ask Ema to help us out.)
Um, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting. And I was wondering if your "tool" there might do the trick?
What... What the heck?
Ah, I think I follow you. So, in essence, it wouldn't matter what was underneath the finished painting.
(Not particularly... But something about the sketch itself is kind of... odd.)
You think we could check out one of the other paintings!?
This one, too!
Um, you think I could just look at the last of these?
Wh-Wh... What the heck is all this!?
Trucy! Look at these three sketches! ...Do you notice anything?
These sketches... are of the three cases I worked on!
The murder in the poker room at the Borscht Bowl Club! The dead man pulling the noodle stand! And then... ...the events that transpired during the Gavinners concert!
That's what I want to know!
Give me a break! Does that seem even REMOTELY possible to you!?
(I'd never even heard of any Drew Misham before. I hadn't even seen a picture of him. But there were my cases, drawn on his canvas! ...Every single one of them. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Just who was this Drew Misham... and what did he have to do with me?)
No clues here.
Good morning!
I'll never understand artists.
Well, it is called "oil paint" for a reason. I bet it's pretty oily. The paint I mean.
...! (She... She speaks!)
Trucy! Let's... take it easy for starters.
(Okaaaaay... Well, that's a start, I guess.)
(There she goes with the nail polish again...)
*sigh* Girls... (The victim, Drew Misham, was a forger. And a stolen painting was found in his studio. A life of crime, really... ...And maybe one that led to his death.)
Why... aren't there any jurists in the courtroom?
(The jurists are unbound by the letter of the law. They don't affect the trial with evidence... but by their "feelings". And we're about to find out just what effect they're going to have.)

There wasn't any poison in the coffee!
(That journalist, no doubt...)
In other words, a freelance journalist, right?
But, you are a journalist. You said so yourself yesterday.
(A "simple case", eh, Gavin? For me, the jury... is still out.)
I'm so happy for him.

9:00 at night? Isn't that a little late for an interview?
Right. Can you tell us what it was like when you arrived?

You were the first reporter ever in "Drew Studio"?
(...By which he means Vera did it.)

...Would you mind being a little more specific?
That's not what I meant!
R-Right! That! (That's what I was going to say, really.)
...Who touched the coffee!?
......

What's this about a star falling?
...Does this matter?
(I think we need to hear about something a little more substantial...)
Um, about when Mr. Misham passed away...
Could you describe that a little more simply?
Well, as an account of the moment of the victim's death, I'd say it's very important. ...Please add it to the testimony.
(You'd think the moment of Mr. Misham's death would be important... ...But Mr. Brushel's story really didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.)
So, you drank the coffee that Vera served you, too?
But you're still alive, which is to say, you didn't die.
...That's not exactly what I was getting at.
(Hmm. No chance the guest would take that one by mistake, I guess.)
We're talking about the coffee the witness drank. I'd say that is important!
(So Brushel drank the coffee, too... Doesn't look like this is going to lead to much...)
You say Mr. Misham had the coffee, too. But did you actually see him "drink" the coffee?
"Yet"?
(Does this guy have a pause button?)
(The coffee Mr. Misham drank... That has to be important somehow... ...Nah.)
The victim drank his coffee, then immediately fell over?
Your Honor! This is a vital piece of information! Please add it to the testimony.

You say it was "definitely death by poison"... How can you be so sure?
(Food poisoning doesn't count. Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?)
(Let's just go with what we have for now.)

You're sure you drank the coffee?
But you say the victim took one sip and fell over. ...And you still kept drinking?
(Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?)
(Let's just go with what we have for now.)

So he either took a sip, or he didn't, and then fell over?
(So Mr. Misham drank the coffee, and fell over immediately... Hmm. I think Brushel's telling the truth, too. Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?)
(There's no real need to change the testimony. The problem with the testimony is already pretty obvious!)


Can you say that for sure?
What if they had been hiding in there from before!?
There's only one moment we need to focus on, really.
Exactly. There has to be something there!
You know what I have a problem with? A particular property of the poison used, atroquinine.
(Why are you using me as an example!?) Unfortunately, we weren't told everything. There was a vital omission in Prosecutor Gavin's information!
Atroquinine is as virulent as he says. But death doesn't come upon ingestion, not immediately. That's because atroquinine is slow-acting!
According to one forensic scientist...
If we suppose that the moment Mr. Misham sipped the coffee was when he sealed his fate... ...then he would still have had time left to enjoy his last cup of joe!
Well, Mr. Brushel? Anything to say... on the record!?
(*sigh*)
"Attorney Utterly Confused", end quote.
Or "I Still Have No Idea What You're Talking About", end quote, I might say.
What was?
...!
Would someone commit suicide in the middle of an interview?

Was there anyone at the studio other than Mr. Misham?
Was anyone besides Mr. Misham and Vera present?
The only person who didn't belong to that studio there... ...was you, wasn't it, Mr. Brushel?

So he put the letter away when he saw you?
I'm not sure I follow.
Are you sure that's OK to do? I mean, isn't that unlawful entry, really?
(I wonder... It does have the ring of something important...)
(I can't see what, though. Nothing seemed unusual.) ...It won't be necessary to add this to the testimony, Your Honor.
The defense finds this testimony vital, Your Honor!

You didn't think anything might be wrong at the time?
So what about now? Thinking back on it, did you sense anything strange in Mr. Misham's behavior?

A "suicide note"...?
So you didn't actually check the letter.
...You can always check the label.

And you saw him seal this yellow envelope with the letter?
...Our big break. Yeah. (What I need is to show some decisive evidence now...)

If he was, that would solve the case in a jiffy.
As it just so happens, there was a single letter in a desk drawer at the scene. In a red envelope!
...Prosecutor Gavin!
Was a yellow envelope found at the scene of the crime?
I guess. But not this envelope. You see, it was postmarked already. Seven years ago.
(And what about the whole red and yellow envelope contradiction, chump!?)
"That night, the victim put a letter he had been writing in a red envelope"...
It's entirely possible!
Oh... You're right! (Gah! The answer was clear if I'd only given it a little thought...)
That's impossible.
It's simple, really.
...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope! With, erm, the assistance of a forensic scientist.
Note that this letter is addressed to "Drew Misham".
Why would he address a letter to himself? Let alone send a suicide note to himself!
His desk drawer...?
Yes, Your Honor?
...Um, I hate to state what should be pretty obvious to anyone... ...but when you catch the scent of a story... ...you make that... er, rather unique face.
("Judge Has Active Imagination"... end quote.)
(A certain case, seven years ago... Wait... "seven years ago"?)

The victim, Drew Misham, had an aversion to reporters?

...Exactly what sort of story was this?
(So a suggestion was enough to get an interview? Mr. Misham must have really wanted to keep it under wraps...)

A certain case, seven years ago? Tell us! What case!?
Wh-Why not!?
(He sounds pretty determined not to talk.)

On the one hand we have your "story", and on the other, this letter. What makes you think the two are related?
(All of them? No. Just the incredibly suspicious ones.)

Just how amazing was "Mr. Misham's talent"?
(This guy is full of wacky gestures... But that one just now was wackier than usual.)
Definitely. I'm sensing something different than before here... (Maybe it's time to bring out you-know-what...)

It all makes sense. Nothing jumps out as ridiculous.
(Something powerful enough to drag Drew Misham out of hiding. I wonder... Maybe it had something to do with Mr. Misham's art?)
Sweat much, Mr. Brushel?
It's more than that. When "Mr. Misham's talent" was mentioned... ...you suddenly began to sweat buckets.
You're hiding something... about his talent!
(Evidence time. Let's show where Mr. Misham's true "talent" lay!) It just so happens I have evidence showing the "talent" mentioned in that letter!


Oh...
(...Let's try that again. All I have to do is reveal what Mr. Misham really was. That shouldn't be so hard, right?)
This painting was found in Mr. Misham's studio.
There are two problems with this painting. The first is it wasn't painted by Mr. Misham. The second is that there was another painting in the studio... ...which looked exactly like this one. Except it was only half done!
Then we have a letter discussing a payment of $100,000. Which suggests a certain business operation. The business of making forgeries!
...That is all, Your Honor.
Criminal elements...? What...!? You can't seriously be talking about...
(Ah ha! This is my chance!) So the victim had ties to the criminal world, right? He could have had plenty of enemies we know nothing about!

But how do you explain all this money? You have to admit there's a possibility of some illegal activity here!
...!
The cross-examination showed Mr. Brushel didn't have reason or means to poison him. As long as there're no other suspects... ...then the killer had to be Vera. That's what. ...This next testimony is our last chance!
R-Right... (...I still have one trump card left to play. And I won't let this trial end until I use it!)

But that doesn't prove Vera poisoned it!
...!

And you witnessed her pouring the coffee?
...Wha--!?
(I don't think I'm going to get anywhere with this coffee mug. I need to find another weak spot in this case.)

...You're sure about that?
One of those candies might have been poisoned!
...! (It was a long shot anyway.)
(The possibility is there, I can feel it. Just maybe not prove it, not yet. And possibility isn't going to cut it, not now!) Mr. Misham ingested that poison via a route other than that coffee!
Proof... is possible. (I gotta risk it...)

I-I know that!
(*sigh* Another hole in this case that needs plugging before I can prove anything. But first things first. I'd better uncover a weak spot before I try to strike again!)
It... can't be proven.
(*sigh* Another hole in this case that needs plugging before I can prove anything. But first things first. I'd better uncover a weak spot before I try to strike again!)
It... can't be proven.
(Wait a second... We already know a letter might have left the studio that night. Couldn't that have opened another path for poisoning? The situation's already changed... I just need to take advantage of it!)

Not one thing...? You're sure?
(Did something leave the studio that night? Why does that sound familiar? Where have I heard something like that before...?)
...... (I can't think of a single thing!) ...If anything did leave, wouldn't Mr. Brushel have noticed?
I think one thing might very well have left the studio that night, actually. A certain something that has vanished from the crime scene.
...Of course.
Believe me, any comic relief I may provide is entirely unintentional.
Well, this thing wasn't at the scene of the crime, so I can't show it to you. But I do have evidence that shows how it could have been taken from the scene!


(There goes my career in stand-up...)
This is the only link between that studio and the outside world.
What did Mr. Brushel just tell us? When he entered the studio on the night of the murder... ...the victim had just finished writing a letter!
Furthermore, you went on to tell us... ...that he put the letter in a yellow envelope and put it in the letter box.
But that very same letter box was empty! In other words... ...that night, the "yellow envelope" disappeared!
Huh...?
Well, if it did disappear, then something did leave the studio that night. That seems very important to me!
(I wouldn't be so sure. A letter disappeared from the crime scene that night... This is exactly the opening I've been looking for!)

Nothing could be more serious than an envelope disappearing from that studio! And you were hiding that fact from us!
(...Right, how Mr. Misham was poisoned. I know. But Mr. Brushel's testimony has changed, which means the facts of the case have, too. And what he's told us means something entirely different now, I'm starting to think.)

You say "clearly" as though it were obvious. But this claim that the defendant poisoned the victim is merely conjecture!
(If only I could believe that.)
...Well, that's kind of what you want from a testimony, really. (...I need to keep my eye on what matters. How, and why, was Drew Misham, killed? Vera poured the coffee, that's not going to change. But if that coffee didn't kill him, I need to find what did... and prove it!)
Proof is... possible. (Here goes nothing...)
Of course. And, Prosecutor Gavin, I hope you understand... ...I'm ready to give you that proof.
I have proof of the disappearing envelope!
Of course, which means... ...that envelope had a stamp on it.
As we all know, stamps come with dried glue on the back. In order to use the glue you have to wet it... ...by licking the stamp!

Even if you wanted to talk to him, you couldn't. ...He's dead, after all.

If he licked the back of a poisoned stamp, the poison would get on his tongue, yes? What would then happen if he put the coffee mug to his mouth, hmm?
Those traces on the mug weren't the killer's doing! It was the other way around!
The coffee mug didn't poison Mr. Misham... ...Mr. Misham poisoned the coffee mug himself!
Recall, if you would... ...atroquinine is a slow-acting poison, yes? The poison entered his body when he put the stamp on that envelope. But his time wasn't up until the very moment he touched his lips to that cup of joe.
(Uh oh. His nose is picking up another scent...)
...!
Actually, I'm glad no other stamps were found. It makes proving the stamp he used was poisoned possible!


(Grr... Do you smile like that when you torture all your victims, or just me?)
(...I think I'm making this out to be way more complicated than it really is. That stamp would have left a small atroquinine residue on something... But what?)
It was on the victim's desk, Your Honor. ...Quite empty, as you can see for yourself.
Ah, apparently you weren't as observant as you should have been. You see, when you saw this frame, it was missing something quite important.
Yes. A pale bluish stain on the inside of the frame... Atroquinine residue!
The frame is only two inches square. The face of the frame is even smaller. Maybe an inch wide at most.
...Oh, but I am. Tell me: what fits in such a small frame? A commemorative stamp, perhaps?
So the poisoned stamp might have been a murder weapon, aimed at him!
(Finally, something we agree on.)
Oh, I disagree.
Recall, if you would, the victim's reclusive lifestyle. Drew Misham hid from the world. He avoided meetings. His only contact with the outside world... was the mail.
Now, if you wanted to kill someone you couldn't meet, but you knew read letters... ...a stamp would be the perfect weapon!
(I might not have "evidence" per se... But things are finally starting to come together!)
I think I know what happened! I don't believe it... but I can see it! I think I know how Mr. Misham was killed!
...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor. I can show you how someone with the intent to kill sent Mr. Misham the stamp of death!


Huh...? (Was I wrong?)
Yeeeeargh!
Yes, Your Honor. (Let's think this one over again.)
Think about the text of the letter again. There were two pages in the envelope. This is page one. ...And this is page two. I want to draw your attention to one phrase in particular. "...Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp within 3 days." The enclosed stamp, Your Honor.
Now, what if he had done exactly as the letter asked?
Fifteen minutes wouldn't have elapsed between affixing the stamp, and mailing the letter. But the clock started ticking, and when the time came... he drew his last breath. And the murder weapon would be taken away from the scene.
......
...W-Well...
(Ack! It was seven years ago, and we don't even know who sent that letter!)
Ah... Ema!
...Don't quit your day job.
Mess...?
That's right! The poison detection spray...
Well, um...
I think we just won!
A c-contradiction?
E-Ema explained that! He must have realized it was poisoned!
...!
Ah...!
...... Uh... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!
I don't think we're winning anymore.

OK... Then how do you explain the poisoned stamp that was in this envelope?
Uh...

What about the atroquinine residue, huh!?
...! Y-Yeah, but...
...... Urk.
I-I can't believe it! The poison traces match up! It can't be coincidence!
...Yes, Your Honor!
(I haven't been on the wrong track this whole time, I'm sure of it! The traces of atroquinine, the envelope, the frame... ...and Drew Misham's mysterious death... They're all connected somehow!)
...The defense stands by its case, Your Honor. We've seen that the logical outcome of the evidence makes no sense. Which means that one of our clues... must be a fake.
The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...
...Without a doubt, Your Honor.
...Oh.
Oh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. "It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!")
...Without a doubt, Your Honor.
...Oh.
Oh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. "It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!")
...I'll explain. We have an envelope, a frame, and a mug, linked by poison. That all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the victim himself!
(The fake clue... Fakes... forgeries...) Ah...!
I don't know if I'm right... but I'm going with it anyway! What if our "forger" is the "fake"!?
Seven years ago, our forger sniffed a trap, and stepped aside. ...Seven years passed. Now the forger stumbles into that very same trap, and dies. ...Why?
Because the forger who was killed... was a fake.
One forger smelled the trap. One forger fell into the trap. That's two forgers! And one of them was a fake!
(If Drew Misham wasn't the real forger... ...there's only one other person it could have been!) ...Understood, Your Honor. Forger Drew Misham was himself a forgery! The real forger was...!


(Ack! "Attorney Makes Wild Claim, Becomes Subject Of Mass Ridicule"... end quote! Better come up with something quick before that story goes to print...!)
There can be only one explanation, really. The real identity of the forger known as Drew Misham is none other than... ...his only daughter, Vera Misham!
Let's consider it before you write it off entirely. If you look at the paintings in the studio, one fact becomes quite clear. Forgery had been taking place in that studio for quite some time! The forger wasn't caught in that trap seven years ago. This can only mean that the one who was caught in the trap wasn't the forger!
One more thing! Only two sets of fingerprints were found in the forger's studio. Drew Misham's... and Vera Misham's.
If we know that Drew Misham wasn't the forger... ...that leaves only one possibility, by process of elimination. The forger was Vera Misham. ...Well?
(Was that... an expression of emotion I saw on her face? She's staring holes into Prosecutor Gavin's face...)
...!
(The court was in an uproar, and it wasn't coming down. We had to break for a ten minute recess.)
Well, the Drew Misham who was killed... ...wasn't "Drew Misham the forger", basically.
Well "he" was actually...
(...Doing her nails.) So, you really made those forgeries?
Anything...?
...Forgeries.
So, you were already a, um... You were already creating your "works" back then?
So the one who figured out the stamp was poisoned, that was...
R-Right! (Out of time...)
...Yes!?
Your late father...?
...How'm I supposed to know?
Judging from the relative ages involved, I'd say it's highly unlikely. (Things are already confusing enough with all these daddies running around. We know that the victim's daughter, Vera, was the forger. What does this mean for the case...? Guess we're about to find out.)
(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)
(There's that stare again... She's drilling more holes into his head.)
What's "hard"!?
...!
Right! OK! (I need more information about this "forger"... ...This "Drew Misham"...)

So, these "things" you were making, er... ...you mean paintings identical to other paintings, right?
...Your Honor! She had no idea what she was doing was illegal!
...... About this "commemorative stamp". Could you tell us more about it?
Yes?
...! (This is something new!)

By "other than a painting", you mean... ...you'd only done paintings up to that point?
For instance...?
(...None of this makes her sound very innocent at all!)
(Uh oh...)
...... About this "commemorative stamp". Could you tell us more about it?
Yes?
...! (This is something new!)

So, you didn't know how the things you were making were being used?
Can you tell us what happened to the "papers" that were in this envelope?
Um... did he follow the instructions? "Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp"...

What do you mean, you "received" it!?
Y-You didn't use that stamp because it was dangerous, correct!? Deadly poison! On the back! Atroquinine...!
...!
So... you didn't know about the poison?
...... (I guess not!)
...... About this "commemorative stamp". Could you tell us more about it?
Yes?
...! (This is something new!)

You mean you moved to where the current "Drew Studio" is?
So that was the real essence of the artist, "Drew Misham". You did the work, and he supplied the face.
...... About this "commemorative stamp". Could you tell us more about it?
Yes?
...! (This is something new!)

M-Magicians...?
You're confusing "mysterious" with "freaky".
Fine, great, yeah, sure. No need to get all excited.
...... (Did she just say what I think she said? Magic "troupe"? Now where have I heard that before...?)

(The red envelope came after she'd completed her first "job"... That makes it a letter from her client... whoever wanted a forgery made.)
We're close. We just have to piece together the parts: A deadly weapon in a red envelope... ...and the path it took to take Drew Misham's life.
Those magicians you liked, was it this bunch!?
Good question!
(What's with Gavin...?)

...Prosecutor Gavin! The defendant is answering all of your questions! Stop badgering her!
Sullied... who?
...!
...Whaaaaaat!? (Phoenix Wright, tossed out of the profession by false evidence... And the forger who made that evidence... ...is this girl standing right in front of me!?) Vera! You must tell us! The evidence you made was used in a trial seven years ago. Who asked "Drew Misham", you, to forge that evidence!? ...For all of our sakes, who was it!?
You... You met the client!? Well, who was it!?
Who was it!?
Ve... Vera!!!

The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track...)

Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
...Um... You sure about that?
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)

This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...?
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)

Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)

Mr. Brushel! You're hiding something!
Ack! Sorry! It's just... the way you were moving just now. It was particularly suspicious.
...Sorry. My mistake. You're fine. (I know I'm on to something here. Time to focus!)
The nail polish Mr. Wright gave me. This must be the brand symbol. It's an "A", drawn like a flower. It's refreshing to see a brand with a simple, clear design like this.
There's an address on here... And a name I've never heard of. At least, I think so... It's too blurry to read.
...The defense is ready, Your Honor.
It... is unusual.
That's being a little harsh. (They can't delay the trial any longer. ...Or they risk having no one left to try.)
(Right... if Vera dies, the trial will be cancelled. ...I'm not going to let that happen! Mr. Wright told me everything that's been going on behind the curtain all these years. I'm going to get Vera her innocent verdict while there's still time!)

But Vera was poisoned with atroquinine! The exact same poison that took her father's life!
...What we need to worry about isn't the verdict... but the trial itself! The defense holds that Vera Misham is the victim not the killer!
(...I've got two things to prove here. Who did it, and how. Which to hit first?)
How did the killer poison Vera Misham...? I will focus first on the method used.
...Yes, Your Honor.


(OK, I'm wrong, I get it.)
Something the matter?
As Prosecutor Gavin has told us, this is nail polish.
...It's like paint for nails. Know any women with red nails?
Let's recall yesterday's trial. Remember when Vera was testifying to the court?
(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)
Whenever Vera became nervous, she had a habit... ...of biting her nails.
...Prosecutor Gavin? When the prosecution had Vera examined, did they check her nails?
...Yes?
...Yes.
Why do you ask? Know someone else who might have a bottle like this?
...Understood, Your Honor. (No problem. I know what I'm doing this time.)


(...No slouching now, Justice! This is my chance to drag the real killer out into the light of day! I know who gave Vera that bottle!)
...I know. However... ...that doesn't mean it was impossible to do what he did.
Ask yourselves "when" he put the poison in the bottle. It could have been yesterday. ...It could have been a month ago. Maybe it was a year ago? ...Or perhaps, it was seven years ago.
Just who poisoned Vera Misham? I have a name for you.
...I understand. (No problem. I know what I'm doing this time.)


(...No slouching now, Justice! This is my chance to drag the real killer out into the light of day! I know who gave Vera that bottle!)
...I know. However... ...that doesn't mean it was impossible to do what he did.
Kristoph Gavin had the opportunity to poison Vera Misham!


(OK, I'm wrong, I get it.)
Something the matter?
As Prosecutor Gavin has told us, this is nail polish.
...It's like paint for nails. Know any women with red nails?
Let's recall yesterday's trial. Remember when Vera was testifying to the court?
(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)
Whenever Vera became nervous, she had a habit... ...of biting her nails.
...Prosecutor Gavin? When the prosecution had Vera examined, did they check her nails?
Kristoph Gavin didn't have to "poison" that bottle the day of the poisoning, Your Honor! The moment Vera first held that bottle in her hand, her fate was sealed!
...Prosecutor Gavin doesn't seem to think so.
...That face tells me one thing. Kristoph Gavin's own younger brother doesn't find it inconceivable at all.
......
I think you already know, Mister Kristoph Gavin.
(Ack... Why do I feel like somehow, he's still my boss...?)
...Does this bottle look familiar?
She's not dead yet!
Her "taste" indeed! This nail polish was how Vera Misham was poisoned!
......
(I'm accusing Kristoph Gavin, my ex-boss. But I know he poisoned the Mishams! The question is "when" could he have done it...? Not to mention... "why"?)

Tell me, is this nail polish expensive?
And you, and Vera, just happen to both use it? That can't be a coincidence!
Huh?
(Are we all done showing off our refined tastes?)

Can't you still make contact with the outside world in solitary?
Yeah... You think so, too, Trucy?
(Hmm... And maybe that's a weakness I can turn to my advantage...)

The defendant is not dead yet!
You seem to know a lot about atroquinine.

Vera had no reason to want to commit suicide! And also... ...who would commit suicide by doing their nails!?
"Something that she liked"...?
They could use a little more teamwork, though.

Both Vera and Mr. Misham were poisoned with atroquinine. That really can't be a coincidence.
I think that's how prosecutors are supposed to be, actually. (Though he is acting different than usual... ...I'll bet it has a lot to do with his brother Kristoph being in the room...)
Right. Quick and painless. (...My bracelet should do the trick!)

(OK... I'm questioning my ex-boss. His testimony seems water-tight... but he's lying. I'm sure I'll be able to see something... as long as I focus!)
It was you who killed Drew Misham.
Oh, really? ...But you see, I saw it. Right when you said "her father, too"! Your hand tensed unnaturally, and a little devil appeared to give me the news.
...Sorry, but there's more than one way to poison a man. You don't need nail polish to get to someone's mouth.
...But you found a way, all the same. And I found it, too.
This is how you poisoned Mr. Misham!


Huh...?
(...Relax, Justice. I've come this far, I must know the answer... ...How did the killer get to his victim, when the killer was in jail...?)
I'm sure this commemorative stamp requires no introduction.
The night Mr. Misham died, he was seen writing a letter. Atroquinine was found on this stamp, Mr. Gavin.
Yes, you are. Oh, and yes... ...this stamp was found in your prison cell!!!
...That is all, Your Honor.
After Drew Misham was killed, someone paid a visit to this witness's cell. ...Phoenix Wright.
That's when he found the stamp. You made Drew Misham write you a letter! That's how you killed him!
His desk drawer...?
What are you getting at?
...!
Wh-Whaaaaat!?
(He's right, though... ...How could anyone have known Mr. Misham would use that stamp that night? Least of all Kristoph Gavin locked away in his cell...)
Huh!? Oh, it was that...
Uh...
"Coincidence"...
Wh-What?
(Now here's something: why didn't he bring up the motive from the very beginning? ...Unless he was afraid it was a battle he might lose...!)
...It means there might be a weak spot! Maybe I have some evidence to prove a motive...
(That's... pretty vital.)
(I'm going through with this no matter what!) ...Understood, Your Honor. I'd like to present evidence.


Hmm...?
(Drew Misham had another "business" besides painting. Add a "lawyer" to that... and the puzzle is complete.)
Your Honor! I'm plenty numb now... Can I try again?
Kristoph Gavin's motive becomes clear... ...when we consider why the stamp came to Drew Misham's studio in the first place.
Forgery, Your Honor. Go back seven years. Drew Misham accepts his first job creating forged evidence.
...This evidence is a fake, yes. But did Mr. Wright request the forgery be made? That was never proven!
...... Just out of curiosity... ...do you remember this letter? This is the first page. ...And this is the second.
The "enclosed stamp" was none other than the poisoned commemorative stamp! Drew Misham drew his last breath just the other day. However! The motive for his murder was already seven years old!
The client who requested this forgery was very cautious. He tried to erase anything... and anyone with connections to the forgery!
...But he made a mistake.
...The killer's "time bomb" was delayed. The poisoned stamp was sealed within a glass frame... ...where it sat for seven whole years.
......

...Sorry, but that's not how this is going to go down.
I checked through the records on that case... when I found this. ...Seven years ago, just before the trial began...
And one more thing...
Phoenix Wright was put on the case the day before the trial started. He didn't have time to request a forgery!
Now here's a question. Just who was Shadi Enigmar's previous defense attorney?
...But it is all true. There was another man, a defense attorney with a badge on his collar... ...it was you! Kristoph Gavin!

It's easy enough to look up, Mr. Gavin.
...!
...!
(Prosecutor Gavin looks like he's in physical pain! That darkness... ...I have to pull that darkness out of him... And proof is the only way I can! What proves Kristoph Gavin's link to Drew Misham!?)
It can be proven.
...I am.
...Fine, Your Honor. (All I have to prove is any kind of link. Something that ties Kristoph Gavin to Drew Misham... And... I have something that clearly does the job.)


...Your point?
(In other words... wrong evidence.)
(Great, a new nickname already. Time to rethink my evidence... carefully!)
This evidence proves there's a link!
...Is there some problem?
Hmm...?
This is Mr. Wright's reproduction of what was written in the real letter.
When Mr. Wright visited Kristoph Gavin's cell... ...he brought with him a small video camera.
He recorded his entire conversation with you, Mr. Gavin. And the contents of your "personal" mail!
Prosecutor... Gavin?
...!
I'm thinking! But... without evidence... ...I don't have anything I can use on him!
Prosecutor Gavin! Try to remember... ...what's really important to you!
...!
...I'm familiar with the trial. I've watched the video several times.
Well, you did seem unusually well prepared. I mean, Mr. Wright had only just presented his evidence. And the next moment you call in Drew Misham. It was almost as if...
...... (Funny, it didn't even occur to me to wonder... ...But now that I do, I see there's only one possible explanation!) Almost as if... from the very beginning... ...you knew Mr. Wright was going to present that evidence.
...!
Wh... Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Prosecutor Gavin...
Which would have included Magnifi's diary... wouldn't it?
...You're the one missing the forest, Mr. Gavin.
...I think we're finally going to shine a light on the black belly of this thing, Trucy. We've done everything we could. I hope it's enough.
(...Zak wasn't watching his points, or the cards. He was watching the man behind the cards... Kristoph Gavin.)
Hold it! So, the one who requested that forgery was...?
...So you asked Mr. Misham to forge that evidence... ...so you could "win"! But then, when you were dismissed as Zak Gramarye's attorney... ...you used your forged evidence as a trap!
You were afraid your forgery would be revealed, and your reputation trashed! You couldn't leave things to chance... ...so you watched everyone involved with the case, for seven years!
...... (Finally... I knew this moment was coming... I just didn't think we'd get here so fast. Zak Gramarye... gone missing for seven years... Trucy's father!)
...Right. Leave it to me. Allow me to refresh the court's memory. Six months ago, Kristoph Gavin was charged with murdering a "mysterious traveler".
...The details don't really matter right now. What matters is... that traveler was Zak Gramarye!
...Huh?
...! (Did... she already know?)
It all started seven years ago... ...The great magician, Magnifi Gramarye's death started it. Magnifi Gramarye's death, and his student, Zak Gramarye, the suspect. Whoever defended Zak in court successfully would be famous beyond belief. ...Thinking that, Kristoph Gavin did the unthinkable. He forged evidence.
Actually, it was his daughter, Vera, who really did the work. You took precautions when you had that forgery made, didn't you, Mr. Gavin?
That's when you planned your poisoning of the forgers.
But, luck was on Mr. Misham's side. The bomb didn't go off.
...But that wasn't the only bomb he set up.
You noticed something when you requested that forgery. When Vera Misham is nervous, she has a bad habit... ...a tendency to bite her nails.
That nail polish... was her "good luck charm".
It was his insurance.
As long as she lived quietly at home, there was no danger to her. But what if she had to go outside!?
His time bombs sat there for seven years. And then... they went off almost simultaneously.
Mr. Gavin! Have you heard a single thing we've said!?
What...?

What about the restaurant? You killed Zak Gramarye! To keep him from talking!

OK, then why did you kill him!?

Your Honor! Phoenix Wright spent seven years collecting this evidence...
...!
Wh-What...?
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Y-Your Honor!
...!
...! That's right! (I'd totally forgotten!) The Jurist System!
They're not in the court, actually. They're watching everything by video camera.
Incidentally, the one responsible for making this happen... ...was Phoenix Wright.
(...I couldn't think of anything to say. Maybe... because I still haven't seen enough. But someday, I'll know what law is. And I'll fight to change it if I have to!)
Vera!!! I'm so glad, I...
Hey now, don't you start crying, too! Um... sorry you had to see us like this.
V-Vera...?
No, I'm sorry... I shouldn't have pressed you like that... If... If I hadn't you never would have bitten your nails!
Vera...
(It looks like that poison had some effect after all. It killed off whatever was holding Vera back from life.)
No, really, it's OK...
(Is that... me?)
The other lawyer...?
...I'm sure he'd be happy to hear that.
You mean that stack of videos? (...Mr. Wright finished watching them all?)
Huh...?
Y-You did wha... How?
Oh... Trucy... (In the end... he couldn't keep that promise, could he?)
That he can't...
Glad I made your list.
I think he said he had to meet someone.
(*sigh*)
Not loud enough. And I like Ms. Magic Underwear better, anyway.
...And that's pretty much the end of my story. For now, anyway. I've still got a long way to go. And this power of mine... well, it needs some work. But... there's hope now. We'd lost it, but somehow, we found it again. That's why people are smiling again... Hope. Yeah, I think I'll keep at this lawyer thing for a while. Oops, training time. Gotta go. Chords of Steel... here comes Justice!


The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track...)

Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
...Um... You sure about that?
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)

This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...?
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)

Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)

Mr. Gavin! You're nervous about something!
...!
(...Confident or not, I've come a long way, Mr. Gavin. Just a little more to go. ...I need a "word". There must be some word that sends shivers down his spine...)

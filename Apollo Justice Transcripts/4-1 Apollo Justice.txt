(Panicked... Palms sweaty... I can admit it. I'm nervous.)
G-Good morning, sir!
W-Wound up, sir? No! I'm loose! I'm fine!
I-I'm fine! I got up at 5 AM to do my "Chords of Steel" voice workout! I'm fine!
...*cough* (I overdid it again...)
Drift gotten, sir! I-I'm all over that drift!
Yes. Yes! I'm fine, sir!
*gulp*
My name is Apollo Justice. If it isn't clear already, I'm a new attorney. And today is my first trial. N-Not that I'm worried or anything! The defendant has been accused of... murder. My boss wants to help him out, of course... and so do I! I mean, there's no way he did it. Not him! No way!
Whoa!
Good uh, morning!
(First trial: nervous. Meeting him: cardiac arrest.)
... (I think I'm supposed to say something... Uh... help?)
Fine! I-I'm fine!
Uh.
(Well, we're off to a great start.) Um... Are you sure you're OK, I mean, with me?
Mr. Gavin is a top-notch defense attorney. And he's your friend! So why...
Uh?
Um, I... I'm really sorry this happened to you. I mean... I mean, I...
Y-Yes, sir! (...OK. I need to focus. First trial, here comes Justice!)
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
Uh, the defense is, uh, fine! I mean ready, Your Honor! (Mind going blank... Don't panic... Ack, too late!)
Y-Yes, Your Honor! But I'm fine! Really!
...*cough*
(OK, so Gavin's got trial experience, fine. But does he have Chords of Steel!?)
(Mr. Wright... How could this have happened?)
Grape juice... How long has it been since I drank grape juice? Apparently, it's Mr. Wright's favorite drink. I wonder how well it goes with borscht?
The bottle is completely empty.
The Court Record... Right! I've heard of that!
(Right, the Court Record Button. Sounds like it's time for some hands-on action!)
(This is it, my first trial! Here goes nothing!)
R-Right, Your Honor! (My first cross-examination! Don't blow it!)
Bullets...!? Where!?
My brain feels strained and raspy, sir.
(What to do? Should I ask Mr. Gavin for a refresher course in cross-examination?)
(Better safe than sorry, especially this early in the game!) Yes, teach me! I know nothing!
But I didn't hear anything strange at all in the testimony just now...
Press... him?
(Uh... But isn't Mr. Wright my client?)
Yes! Thank you, sir! I think I can do it!
No need for help here, sir! I think I've got this one covered!
(I'm fine! The Chords of Steel are ready for battle! My weapons: press and present...)
("Inconsistencies"? "Lies"? Phoenix Wright...? As if! Phoenix Wright would never lie, and it's up to me to prove it.)

You can hardly play...?
(Was that supposed to be a boast just now...)

They pay you just to play poker?
Wha--?
Wait, you've never lost once? Not even one time!?
(He's played poker for seven years and not lost once... Is that even possible!?)
Th-That's right! It was a simple game, after all!
Huh?
Ack! (Argh! I completely let that one slip by!)
S-Sir?
(Just one little press... ...and I've got myself a whole new testimony!)

The room in the crime scene photo... is an attraction?
B-Black market?
(That window does look like it would be good for keeping a look-out but little else.)
Th-That's right! It was a simple game, after all!
Huh?
Ack! (Argh! I completely let that one slip by!)
S-Sir?
(Just one little press... ...and I've got myself a whole new testimony!)

Two decks of cards?
...?
Th-That's right! It was a simple game, after all!
Huh?
Ack! (Argh! I completely let that one slip by!)
S-Sir?
(Just one little press... ...and I've got myself a whole new testimony!)

So, you claim you weren't gambling?
You didn't bet any money? Not even a little?
(Um... Can we get back to the trial now?)

S-Silence?
But why? That clearly puts you at a disadvantage...
(Great. Like I didn't have enough to do already...)
Huh...? (Wait... Something he said did ring a little strangely. Just one thing... Now what was it!?)
(A contradiction in Mr. Wright's testimony? But why!? I'd better check the Court Record.)

(I can't imagine Mr. Wright lying in a testimony...)
R-Right! I got it! I'm fine! (Time to listen to that testimony again.)
So you say you didn't touch the murder weapon... this grape juice bottle? ...Right?
...
Objection!
Aha ha ha...
(B-But what about my Chords of Steel...?) Any... Anyway! What's so strange about fingerprints on a bottle in a restaurant?
...Huh!?
Auuuuuuuuuuuuuugh! M-Mr. Gavin! I think things just took a turn for the worse!
Huh?
"Near" the scene...?
Wow. The batteries are held in with a piece of tape... He should just buy a new one. Maybe he can't afford it... or he just doesn't care.
(Nice save, Mr. Gavin! I'd better not waste this!)
(So someone else was in the room the night of the crime! That must mean they witnessed the crime...)
(So I used a little hair gel! Relax, people!)
Isn't violence against hair a crime, Your Honor?
Excuse me? The Hydeout?
Whaaaaat!?
(So there were three people in the room at the time of the crime... The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... ...Olga Orly, our witness! ...And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer, that means...!)

That's ridiculous! Um, because... Because Mr. Wright can't lose!
But! He hadn't lost in seven years!
(I think he means "poker face"...)

You were dealing cards... Do you do this often?
Thank you for NOT handing out flyers during the cross-examination.

It's already April. How could it be cold?
(No way am I going there.)

His "locket"...?
Um... The defense would like a clarification: this is a locket we're talking about? I mean, a pendant with a picture in it, right? Not a "rocket"?
No, a locket's a locket! It doesn't matter what shape it is
(Hard of hearing, or hard of understanding?)


Something terrible!?!?
Er, sorry. (I need to seriously reconsider this vocal training thing...)

But the defendant would never do such a thing!

Oh really? "Strangled", you say? That's odd.
No, I mean this report shows that the victim died of a blow to the head!
Ms. Orly! Really now... Did you witness the crime!?
(Oh really, Ms. Orly? I think I've caught you in your own lie this time!)
Wh-What do you mean? I found a contradiction!
(There's such a thing as thinking too much... This horse is dead, let's stop beating it!)

You didn't say anything about hitting before!
(So he strangled him, then hit him...? Something's fishy about all this...)
Right, sir! Leave it to me! (There were only three people in the room at the time of the murder. The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer... I've got you now, Orly!)
(You know, there was one curious part in her testimony just like Mr. Gavin said. But what does it mean?)
Recall the testimony, Your Honor... The victim played with "his hand on locket at his neck", I believe she said?
No, but look at this photograph. Do you see a locket on the victim's neck?
B-But what does it mean?
Lockets don't just "disappear", Your Honor!
Taken it off... Wait, you dont mean...!
C-Come again?
(So Mr. Wright has a locket, too...? Why don't I buy that this is just a coincidence...?)
(Methinks the judge watches too many old court movies. Mr. Wright said he hasn't lost in seven years, so this testimony must be wrong!)

Are those the usual starting points? Were any special rules used...?
(Please, this isn't calculus. It's not even long division!)


Are the chips in this photo all the chips that were used?
...? (Something's fishy with these chips. Should I press harder?)
(...Nah. ...It's her nature to be jumpy and suspicious-looking.)
Maybe you could explain a bit about these "chips"?
...Thanks. (Now that I've pressed her I'd better ask something...) What are these chips worth? Are they in dollars? Or rubles, even?
Sir!
In more ways than one, sir.
(Way to fill me with confidence...)
Yes, I do think this deserves further scrutiny. Add it to the testimony! (I wish I knew where I was going with this...)

(Mr. Gavin said this testimony is important! ...To be honest, I have no idea why.)
Ack! Sorry! I'm fine! (I'd better think of something to ask... and quick!) Um... The two types of chips...
Um. The small ones are 100, and the big ones 1,000... Uh? Right? Right. Of course.
*sigh* ...
Um... Yeah. *gulp* (Great. Mr. Gavin made me stop her, and now I'm the one who looks dumb.)
Huh? Who? Me!?
(What...!?)
("Calculation"...?)


You're telling me that Mr. Wright, undefeated for seven whole years, was losing?


"Last hand"?

And...? What happened next!?
What "such thing"!?
What "such thing"!?
Yes, sir! (Look out contradiction, here comes Justice!)
You're sure it was the victim who won? Absolutely sure?
Of course, Your Honor. In this photo I see small chips and I see large chips. Tell me.. which were worth 1,000 points?
Oh, I thought so too... but then the totals don't add up.
Let's review what the witness told us: Each man started with 3,500 points in chips. And the combined total value of the chips was 7,000 points.
Um, they are, Your Honor. Now! Look at this photo that allegedly shows all the chips. If the big chips are worth 1,000 points, and the small chips are worth 100... And you add them up...
(Do it yourself... You aren't in kindergarten, are you?) ...10,600 points. The chips don't add up! This clearly contradicts the witness's testimony!
(Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)
This calculation makes the answer clear! If the total combined points at the table was 10,600... Then each man started the night with 5,300 points!
Eh?
(Uh oh... Time to head back into the kitchen!)
The odd thing here is the number of chips... Right, Mr. Gavin?
Uh... Just in case?
(That's not the only thing failing the judge.)
Each man began the game with 3,500 points. If all the chips are indeed shown in this photograph... Then there can be only one answer.
The value of the chips... was the other way around!
Want to know what I think?
The small chips were worth 1,000 points, not the big ones!
Well... I'm just glad I was the one who said it.
...Exactly. If the small chips are 1,000 points, and the large chips are 100... Let's do a little math. Add up the points for each side of the table!
Well now... It seems that Mr. Wright was winning that night after all!
My client had even less reason to kill the victim! After all... he was winning!
Now... Ms. Orly. You must have known the true value of the chips. Since you were there at the scene of the crime... weren't you?
(They're all the same thing!)
(Great... Just great... First we have lying... now cheating...)
Ms. Orly! Why did you not tell the court about this from the very beginning!?
(I thought I smelled a cover-up here... Well folks, it's time to throw back the covers!)
Um... Mr. Gavin? What's a full house?
(What is this, some kind of secret court poker ring!?)
Uh, yeah! No problem! Two cards with the same number makes a pair, and three makes a three of a kind!
(Hmm... That doesn't sound very easy to make, does it.)
(Wow... They both have full houses!)
(If he did cheat in the last hand, that still leaves one important question... Mr. Wright lost that hand. Who's ever heard of a professional con man losing when they cheat!?)

Just how hard is it to make a full house, anyway?
... I guess that's right.
(OK. Full house: Hard. This line of questioning: A waste of time.)

Four of each card, you say?
Huh, you don't say.
Huh, you don't say. (Isn't that one day short?)
Huh, you don't say. (We're going to be in this courtroom for a year if it keeps going like this!)

How was it "clear"?
A f-fifth ace!?

A fifth ace...?
Nnnk...!
You bet! I've no intention of staying quiet! Not me! No sir! (...I'd better find some contradicting evidence fast!)


Do you recall what the men were arguing about?

However! Mr. Wright lost the hand! That seems to cast the shadow of doubt on Mr. Smith!

By bottle, are you referring to... this?
(Hefty enough to brain a grown man, apparently.)
(First she says it was a serious competition, now she says there was cheating...)
Actually, yes! I had noticed that!
Right! Leave it to me!
It appears the witness is mistaken...
Look, this piece of evidence clearly contradicts what you said in your testimony!


Why, it's here, of course!
Where... Uhm... Good question!
Er, sorry, Your Honor. (I'd better rethink this.)
Ms. Orly, in your testimony, you made the following claim: "Mr. Smith's hand has three aces"... But as you can clearly see, the victim's hand only held two aces!

Take another look at the evidence! As you can see, the defendant also had two aces in his hand. Where's this fifth ace? I see cheating alright, and it's going on right here in this courtroom!
(That's odd... She must be lying, yet she's the most sincere I've seen her all day.)
Mr. Gavin?
(If these cards don't prove cheating was going on, nothing will! Now... which of these hands is more suspicious?)
(It was the victim's hand that "changed" over the course of the witness's testimony...) The defense requests time to examine Mr. Smith's cards.
Y-Yes, sir!
(Let's start with Mr. Wright's hand.) The defense would like to view the defendant's hand.
Right... Right, sir!
(OK... Let's do this!)
The card backs are red... For some reason I thought that they were using blue cards in that final hand... Didn't you, Mr. Gavin?
(Uh... I think I found out that I found nothing out.)
(Well? Do I examine the other hand of cards?)
(Guess I'll examine Mr. Wright's cards.) Your Honor! The defense requests time to examine Mr. Wright's hand!
(Don't worry, Justice is always swift!)
(No... According to the testimony, it was the victim's hand that changed. Better take a closer look!)
(Uh... Not unless you count utter confusion.)
(Well? Do I examine the other hand of cards?)
(Maybe I missed something the first time... Better check them again.)
(Guess I'll examine the victim's cards...) Your Honor! The defense requests time to examine Mr. Smith's hand!
(Don't worry, Justice is always swift!)
(Wh-What...!?) Your Honor! Look at this! One of the victim's cards... The back is a different color!
The card backs are red... For some reason I thought they were using blue-backed cards in the final hand...
Only one of cards has a blue back... I'm much more of a red guy myself. Blue is so... not red, you know?
Wait, so you mean... This witness... Ms. Orly...
(Focus, Justice! Time to take advantage of her! ...I mean, of her mistake!) Your Honor! Please recall the testimony we just heard!
...Ergo! Ms. Olga Orly conspired to cheat, not with my client... ...but with the victim, Mr. Shadi Smith!
Not only did she cheat, she cheated poorly! Therefore! It's not hard to imagine an altercation between her and the victim...
(Time for Justice! There were three people in the room at the time of the incident. And if Mr. Wright isn't guilty, that means...) ...I am! The defense accuses the witness, Ms. Olga Orly, of murder!
Your Honor!
And that means...!?
(I did it! I held out!)
M-Mr. Wright...
Why use different colored backs?
(Um, you used different colors and they STILL got mixed up.)
(Yeah, me too... I'm sure someone said something about blue cards...)
Y-Yes?
("When...?)
(When was the card swapped into the deck?)
Well, it must have happened before the murder.
Huh? Why?
Ack! The back...
Sorry, let me think about this some more...
Well... weren't they swapped during the murder?
Huh? Well, the very moment of the act, I guess...
... Uh... could I have a moment?
Sorry... Let me rethink this.
Perhaps it happened... after the murder?

Yes! But tell me... How do you swap cards during the game!? I'll take "silly" over "impossible".
Oh? Even when the backs of the cards are a different color!? If you pulled that during the game, you'd be caught in no time!
Wh-Who?
(OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?)
The one who swapped the cards was... Mr. Wright! It was you, wasn't it?
Ack! Uh, well, because, uh... ...maybe you were trying to hide the fact that you'd cheated?
Oh.
(Come to think of it, he would lack a motive for helping his opponent to win...)
Why, it must have been Olga Orly who swapped the cards! She was trying to cover up evidence of the cheating.
Huh?
(Actually, I have trouble imagining even the judge making that mistake.)
R-Right!
The one who swapped the cards wasn't Mr. Wright, of course. And, well, it doesn't seem like it could have been Olga Orly, either...
Yes, yes, I know! But... But she was the one who dealt the cards, right? I... I just can't believe she would make the mistake of swapping the wrong color card!
Er, yeah, well, that is the question, isn't it?
Huh?
Right... The person replaced the fifth ace with a king.
Y-Yes, sir!
Um.. Can I ask you something?
That locket you wear... Is that really yours, Mr. Wright?
I'm... just surprised to hear you had a daughter.
One more question.
The one who cheated that night... Was it you?
Huh?
I-I never! Honest! But... (It IS odd that he managed to go undefeated for seven whole years...)
Eh...?
Poker.. is like trial law!?
Well, yeah, but that's harder than it sounds.
...!
You're kidding!
Uh... No. (C'mon, who'd notice that!?)
B-But, I'm not worthy! I mean, there's no way I'll pick up on these "signals".
Huh?
(What's he talking about...?)
Whaaaaaaaa--!? (I knew it!)
My, um, power? (I had no idea my Chords of Steel were that special...)
Witness! You will tell the court what you were really up to that night!
So you were in cahoots with the victim!
Hey, that's right!
Look who's talking!
(With witnesses like her, who needs criminals? ...And with defendants like Mr. Wright, who needs prosecutors?)

This planted card... which card was it, exactly?
When was this...?

So, everything went according to plan...
Tell us what happened with the search.

The card... disappeared?
But the card was nowhere to be found, is this correct?
(So the Five of Hearts is still missing in action...)

Wait... Isn't that a little odd?
You searched Mr. Wright, er, thoroughly, and found nothing? Which means he didn't cheat... Which means he had no reason to strike the victim!
(Wh-What was that just now!? I... sensed someting...)
No... nothing, Your Honor. (What to do? Should I press her a little harder?)
Ms. Orly...! You're hiding something!
I have one question for the witness then. You say you saw the moment the defendant hit the victim. ...Is this true?
(What's this weird vibe I'm getting!?)
(Touching her neck, was it? Whoa! What's going on? This sensation... It's coming into focus! There! That twitch! It's so clear! It's like I could perceive her habit like I couldn't before!)

Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself...
Whenever you get to a certain part of your testimony... ...you touch the back of your neck with your left hand!
When she says that part of the testimony... She's subconsciously recalling something... Her body reacts to the memory, and she touches her neck! I'm sure of it!
(Her habit is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime... So, what would remind her most of the moment of the crime!?) Ms. Orly. Whenever you recall the crime that night, you scratch your neck. I've noticed it happens when you think about the moment of the crime. There must be some reason behind this "habit" of yours. I believe the weapon that left an inerasable "impression" on your neck is this!


(Uh oh... That must not have been it!)
(I'd better get this sorted out before I develop a habit of my own...)
Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck... And what reminds us more of that moment than this bottle, the murder weapon!
But... something doesn't fit. If you were only the witness to the crime... ...why would that make you touch your neck like you're in pain?
It was Mr. Smith, the victim who was hit... not you!
I'll explain later! Just, trust me. Now's our only chance to break her! Ms. Orly! Please testify, in detail, about the moment of the crime. The very moment!
... Um, we know you're not Russian.
(Nah... I'm just seeing things.) Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue the testimony. (What was that? A dizzy spell? I gotta relax...)

You're hiding something, and that habit of yours proves it!
You touched your neck again.
It's no use trying to hide it. I can see right through you.

Let me ask, how's your eyesight?
(Yeah, but Mr. Wright didn't have a motive to hit the victim! Hmm...)

You seem... uneasy.
(Her eyes are darting all over the place... I must be getting warm!) Tell me... After the crime, what was the defendant like?
I'll tell you what I think! Her testimony is..
...pretty good, really. I'd be upset too at the scene of a crime like that. Yeah, I can picture my mind going blank, staring listlessly...
...is basically bogus. It contradicts the evidence!
(She didn't let him out of her sight until the cops got there... I know there's some evidence that contradicts that!)


This, Your Honor, is the evidence that contradicts her testimony!
(Gah! Me!?)
(Ouch. That one hurt...)

(Different personality... but the same testimony.)
There's got to be a contradiction in there!
Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said! It states that the police were alerted by a report from the defendant!
And we know that the defendant left the room, climbed the stairs... ...and made that phone call from the first floor of the Borscht Bowl Club!
So, explain how you kept your eyes on the defendant... ...when he left the room entirely!
...
M-Mr. Gavin? Sir?
A motive?
(Right, like Mr. Wright was saying before recess!)
Um... sorry.
He or she wasn't considering the color on the backs of the cards...
(Yeah, I had that impression, too... But why?)
(Why do I always get put on the spot like this!?)

I-I was right?

I... I'm seriously sorry. (*gulp* That didn't go well.)
You... You don't mean...
B-But of course Mr. Gavin knows the color of the cards!
B-But look! You can see the colors in this photo!
Mr.... Gavin?
(Is this the truth Mr. Wright was staying silent about!? Well, only one thing to do!) Mr. Wright! The defense would like to request that you testify to the court!
Mr. Gavin...?
Oh... OK. *gulp*
(This was Mr. Wright's strategy! He was planning this all along! And I intend to see it through.) ...The defense would like to request that Mr. Wright testify to the court!
I'm sorry, Mr. Gavin. This isn't about loyalty... This is about the truth!
(As much as I'd like it to, I guess the testimony isn't related to the case, per se.)
...!
I'm sorry, Mr. Gavin...
(But now that we've gone this far, we might as well go all the way!) The defense would like to request that Mr. Wright testify to the court!
S-Sir!
Uh... Understood, sir. (Mr. Gavin vs. Mr. Wright... This can't end well. Why can't I have a normal trial!?)

You had dinner with Mr. Gavin?
"Usual"...?

Five minutes? So, the two of them could have passed in the restaurant during that time?
(C'mon, Mr. Wright... What are you hiding this time!?)

About this failed "trap"... This is the same "trap" that Ms. Olga Orly mentioned?
The card she planted!
The murder weapon!?
(A card inside the murder weapon? That's strange... Did the police miss it in their investigation? Maybe I'll take a look...)

Why in the bottle?
(At least, when you get lucky and stick your hand in your pocket they don't.)

Um, Mr. Wright, if I may?
I've examined the bottle, and I don't see any card in here.
Huh...?
(...So what's going on? Is Mr. Wright hoodwinking us again? Or did the card just... disappear?)
Oh.
(Ugh. Why do I get the feeling we're not on our client's side anymore?)

You made the call to the police from the first floor of the restaurant, correct?
Was anyone else on the first floor at that time?

And when you returned, the victim was already...
(I guess I'd be startled, too, if I walked in on a scene like that.)

Mr. Wright, if I may.
Take a look at this photograph of the crime scene. See the victim here? He's wearing a hat. ...I wouldn't think you could see blood on his forehead.
Eh...?
So... Ms. Orly didn't see it? "It" being the victim's... er, his head.
Mr. Gavin?
(H-Hey, he's still our client! ...Isn't he?)
Oh.
(Ugh. Why do I get the feeling we're not on our client's side anymore?)

Could you explain why you called Mr. Gavin...?
(Is this the "truth" that Mr. Wright was talking about?)
Y-Yes, sir... (I have to think! What's Mr. Wright trying to tell me with this testimony? The truth has to be in there somewhere!)
Uh, Mr. Gavin?
Mr. Wright! If you intend to ever tell the truth about this case... It's now or never!
Eh...?
Your... cell phone?
"Bone china plate"...?
(Wait a second... Something's not right about that phone call!) So, after Mr. Gavin ate dinner with you... ...he left the Borscht Bowl Club?
Then... Then how did he know? When did he see this "bone china pate"?
(Mr. Gavin and Mr. Wright are both in the judge's chamber! Who'd have thought today would turn out like this!?)
Huh? What?
(Wh-What's all this about?) Uh... Is this one OK?
A trump card...?
(An ace... Where do I remember that card from?)
(The missing fifth ace! Wait... This blotch of red... Is this blood?)
This blood-stained card... is my trump card for finding the truth? (I fell deep into thought as my mind raced to understand what this all meant. That girl... I'd seen her recently... But where? That's when I made the connection...)
A single drop of blood marks the front of the card.
(By "secret", I'm guessing he means the fact that Mr. Smith was bald.)
M-Mr. Wright!
That one time... being the instant he was hit!
When Mr. Wright returned from reporting the crime, the hat was lying on the floor. Mr. Wright picked it up, and placed it on the victim's head... In other words, in order to have seen Mr. Smith's bald head... ...you would have had to be at the scene of the crime... at the time of the crime!
...!
Uh, Mr. Wright?
Oh...
Yes, Your Honor... (I can't believe I'm going up against Mr. Gavin... This trial is getting weirder and weirder!)

"That man"... You mean Mr. Smith?
(Well, it makes sense that he'd know. They were friends, after all.)

The little window... You mean the one used to keep watch up the stairs?
Why did you go through the trouble of peeking in through the window? Wouldn't it have been easier to just open the door and go into the room?
Upset Mr. Wright?
(Hmm... So far, everything he's saying makes sense.)

How do you know it was "right after" the murder!?
Urk...
(With friends like these, who needs enemies...)

By "photo" you mean the second photograph of the crime scene?
(And then Mr. Wright came along and replaced his hat.)

Those were the only three at the scene of the crime?

There must have been someone else there at the moment of the crime!
B-But, that goes against what Mr. Wright said!
...!
(How can I show something I can't find myself!?)
The fifth ace... right.
...No. Not yet, Your Honor.
(Great! I don't even know what the heck I'm looking for...)
Y-Yes, sir!
I... already know the answer?
(...It's now or never!) The defense would like to present evidence to the court... Evidence showing the reason why a card was swapped out!


The reason is made clear by... this piece of evidence!
Unnngh...
Yes, Your Honor! (I sure can't let my first trial end like this!)

Wouldn't it have been better to wait for the police to arrive?
(That makes sense... or does it? ...I'm confused.)

Where were you when the phone call came?
(Hmm... So far, everything jives with Mr. Wright's testimony... I think.)
I... I'm fine! (Who was it that taught me never to pull punches in cross-examination? It was you, Mr. Gavin! I learned it from watching you!)
My reason is... uh... This!
Um, well, that's the thing... (Why's Mr. Gavin so upset? It's just a fishy card from some fishy girl...)
I suppose...
Y-Yes!?


Well, for one thing, the killer's in the wrong place. I think.

The witness's location is clearly at odds with... something!
That's right. When it comes to cards, it's "Quick-Fingers" Orly or no one!
... Uh, was I supposed to say something else?
Your Honor! Please, give me another chance!

The second witness's position is the problem!
(Uggh...)
Your Honor! One more chance! Please!

The problem with this picture is... here!
... Er, ack! My h-hand must have slipped. Sweaty, you know.
Y-Yes, Your Honor! (I'm going to need a beach towel.)
Well, isn't it the victim's position that's the problem?
Well... Look, the victim was struck on the head, sending him back in his chair. You'd think any blood would fall behind the body, not onto the table in front of him.
Take a look at the photo again. If he bled in this position... The blood would fall on the floor, not on the cards.
S-Swivel chairs!? Oh man...
It would have to be. So, we have to assume that at the time of the murder... ...the victim's chair was facing away from the table!
That would mean... the killer turned the chair back around.


Well, the contradicting position here is the victim's!
(Uh oh, I missed again.)

The contradicting point is the location of the witness!
That is unclear, even to me!
(I have to take pride in something...)

What doesn't make sense... is the second witness!
Oh! Um, no, of course you do, er, sir.
(Help...!)

The problem with this picture is... Here!
... Ack! Darn sweaty hands! My finger must've slipped!
(Eek!)
The victim was struck from the front, correct?
Well, wouldn't it be hard for the killer to hit him from the front? Sitting where his indicator currently is?
Wha--!? B-But...! (There's no room to put a mark where the killer should be!)


Well, I guess the killer would have to be, uh... Here?
... Um... Sorry?
(C'mon, give me a little hint!)
The killer had to be standing, well... uh... Here!
Ack... (I thought I was on to something there, too!)
Wait! I know! At the moment of the crime, the cupboard... wasn't there!
(Huh? Oh dang!)


The indicator in question is... the victim's!
Ah, good. That's good to know.

The indicator that doesn't make sense here is the killer!
Y-Yeah really! Well, maybe really...
(Maybe if I just came clean and admitted that I'm totally lost he'd go easy on me...)

What doesn't make sense is the witness!
... Erm, yes, I suppose she was.
Your Honor! One more chance, please!

This indicator has to be wrong!
... Um... Look closer?
Yes, Your Honor.
Um, about this cupboard... Are we all OK with assuming it was moved?
Well, if it was... something really doesn't fit. The cupboard would completely cover up the window to the stairs!
That's right! Someone standing outside wouldn't be able to see in. Someone... like Mr. Gavin!
(I do remember him saying something about that, now that he mentions it.)
So the room has a secret passage. Where does it go?
(I see it, but I don't believe it. That girl wasn't kidding when she said I needed this trump card for the last hand.) At the time of the murder, the window was blocked, and the victim's hat... ...was only off his head for the few minutes between Mr. Smith's murder... ...and Mr. Wright's return from calling the cops. In other words, the only place anyone could've seen the victim's bald head... ...was from inside the Hydeout! ...Well, Mr. Gavin? (Come on, say something!)
Actually, I think we can probably figure it out ourselves at this point. That night, for whatever reason... Our killer had a date with Mr. Smith... A date with destiny. There he crouched, hidden in the secret passageway behind the cupboard... Holding his breath, waiting for just the right moment... Then the chance came... and he took it!
Ms. Olga Orly was out cold, struck by Mr. Smith... But his time was soon to come. Mr. Wright went upstairs to call the cops. Leaving Mr. Shadi Smith alone in the Hydeout with the unconscious dealer. Then our killer stepped out from the secret passage and into the Hydeout.
He wheeled his chair around to look, and...
Too bad for him he didn't linger any longer in the Hydeout that night. If he had, he might have noticed the cards on the floor... And the fact that they were all red!
Mr. Gavin...?
The bottle of grape juice Mr. Wright was drinking...
...! (I seem to recall this being an issue earlier...)
Y-Yes!?
Um... Yeah. (Just like what!? Why would anyone grab a bottle upside-down, other than to... *gulp*)
Um... Is there really another?
(Um, how about you just say the answer in plain words?)
(Mr. Gavin said that the court, and this case, demand an explanation... Don't worry. Justice won't leave until justice is done.)


...
(What do they expect!? I have no idea how to explain it.)
It's actually easier to show you than explain, Your Honor. Place that bottle on the floor, next to your chair.
Yes. Now, reach down and pick it up. ...Without getting out of your chair.
See? You naturally go to pick up the bottle by its neck... ...with your fingers upside-down! Look at this photograph taken on the night of the murder. The defendant, Mr. Wright, sat here... ...playing piano, bottles of grape juice on the floor to the side of his piano bench. He would have naturally picked up the bottles upside-down several times.
Basically... you used the bottle on the table to do the deed... But then you must have remembered! So you went and picked up one of the bottles from under the piano... And you switched the bottles! You took one of Mr. Wright's bottles and made it look like the murder weapon!
Wh-What!?
P-Proof!? Well, that's, uh...
(Mr. Gavin probably wouldn't make such a novice mistake, true... That bottle won't bear a trace of anything!)
Y-Yes!
B-But why?
Mr. Wright...
What!? (That's some bottle!)
...! There's something inside the bottle! Wh-What's this?
Er, Ms. Olga Orly?
W-Wait, this isn't...! You're telling me that this is the planted card you "disposed of"? The one you mentioned in this piece of testimony?
Me...?
Mr. Wright...
I'm pretty sure I didn't do a thing in there! It was you who cornered Mr. Gav... the killer.
...Ability?
(Wait, I wonder if he means...)
I have one question for the witness then. You say you saw the moment the defendant hit the victim. ...Is this true?
(What's this weird vibe I'm getting!?)
What... What was that, Mr. Wright?
The answer... Right... Today was full of questions without answers... Most of them about Mr. Gavin.
Huh? Wait... You don't know, do you?
Huh? Oh, that reminds me, I met the girl whose picture is in your locket. Your... daughter, right?
Eh...?
Wait! But that's perjury!!! You testified! You said that locket was yours!
Huh?
Wait, but then... why!? Why was the victim wearing a locket with a picture of your daughter inside it!?
...Speaking of which, I may be out of a job. I work for Gavin Law Offices, after all. (I still can't believe I just saw Mr. Gavin get led away in handcuffs...)
Yes?
Eh!? You mean... at the Wright & Co. Law Offices!? I mean... there's not a single attorney in my generation that doesn't know it!
Wait.. but didn't you... You're not a...
(That incident seven years ago... That legendary trial... And at the middle of it all was one man... Phoenix Wright! The case reached its sad conclusion.. and he left law for good.) Have you ever thought about coming back to the courts?
Forged evidence!? Wh-What are you talking about!?
(Hmm... One piece of evidence struck me as odd, it's true. It just seemed, well, too perfect. I'll bet this was the forged evidence.)



(Hmm, guess that wasn't it.)
...Ah. (The card that girl gave me!)
Then... You really...?
But... But you can't do something like that and call yourself an attorney!
So it's true... The rumor is true! Seven years ago...
...! Nnngh... Grrrraarrrgh!
(I... I punched him...)
Mr. Wright...
And with that, Mr. Wright walked out the door. ...And that's how my first trial ended. A lot of mysteries went unsolved... And, at the time, I had no idea they were all related. Every mystery that day... ...connected by a single thread of logic... I'd find that out soon enough. My name is Apollo Justice, attorney at law. And this is how my story begins...

Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)

This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...?
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)

Your Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence!
...Um... You sure about that?
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)

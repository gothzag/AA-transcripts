Huh? Did you say something? My ears are still ringing... The Gavinners: putting the "sick" back in "music".
When you invite people to a concert it's usually free.
Um, Trucy... You didn't know who Prosecutor Gavin was before that case. What kind of fan doesn't know the lead vocalist's name?
God-awful, maybe.
...That was quite a bit of impulse shopping.
...For Mr. Wright that sounds like a real act of generosity.
(Who would have imagined me here... ...at a Gavinners concert, watching Prosecutor Gavin "rock". To be honest... ...he was kind of cool. And I'm kind of envious. Not that I'd ever admit that to Trucy.)
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
...And the invoice you sent along with them.
Oh yeah... That flyer said she flew all the way over for this show.
(Whoa! Who's this guy? He's huge!)
(That voice... I wish I could understand it... It's beautiful.)
(Lamiroir... Mysterious songstress... Her quiet, deep song glides through the air... Lilting above a sparse, but elegant piano accompaniment. Now this is music. She's a real artist.)
(I've seen this kid somewhere before.)
Good pianists are a dying breed, I hear.
(They're like characters from some fairy tale..)
She does seem quite pretty. At least, her eyes do.
(I should have learned to play the guitar. There's not much romance in Chords of Steel.)
I was surprised Prosecutor Gavin actually burned his guitar.
What a destruction. (I don't think Prosecutor Gavin was expecting it either, oddly. He looked as surprised as I was.)
I'm not sure I'd call that "art".
How many breaks does this band need?
Hey, I didn't do it!
...I'm not sure that's the best move right now.
Those are some pretty heavy-duty gloves. Maybe they have to carry around hot pots or something?
...... That's exactly what I was thinking.
Why is that plastic bowl of stew sitting there?
That's just mean.
I think you need to take a deep breath, Trucy.
This place is decorated like a high-school dance. Though I think our decorations were paper, not... chains.
Huh, no kidding.
They're really into the whole police thing, aren't they.
...They don't have to turn on the red light.
Rocking it hard... under the speed limit.
...I'm not so sure about that last one.
...I don't think that requires an actual whistle, Trucy.
Someone drew the Gavinners's mark in lipstick here.
Oh? You don't use lipstick yet, Trucy?
You'll be waiting a long time then, I'm afraid.
A police uniform hangs on the stand here.
...It's OK, you don't have to go that far to be "special". I mean, you're not exactly the type who's "just another face in the crowd".
(...Now I feel like a meanie for making that insinuation.)
What are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.
Borginese, huh...?
It's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. They have an air of mystery to them that matches her voice.
I thought rock was supposed to be rebellious, not... civic.
Ah, the fickleness of youth.
I like my hair the way it is, thank you very much.
That speaker looks familiar.
Yeah, like the one for the P.A. system back in school.
(That's right, she's still in junior high. ...I feel old.)
What's a police recruitment poster doing here? "Rock on ...with the police."
But that's just silly. Who'd name a band the "police"?
(Sounds like he got lucky.)
(He got lucky, and he didn't realize it...)
Unusually frugal for a rock band.
What's this...?
(All I ever get to sign are client defense agreements.)
You can't do a collaboration alone, you know, Trucy.
What about your magic act?
Then you'd end up only being average in both, no?
Urk! (That's right, he is. I'd totally forgotten.)
(Ugh... I'm having trouble enough with just one thing.)
Y-Yeah?
Right... (I wish I had an alter-ego to hide behind sometimes.)
What are those postcards there, Prosecutor Gavin?
...Ah, that's good to hear. Trucy already swiped one, is why.
...Let the kid dream.
(Grr. Maybe I should try to write some lyrics someday.)
Huh? Oh, I was just...
(OK, I suppose...)
Uh... I think I'll pass.
I liked the bit with Lamiroir. But the rest could use a volume knob. Turned way down.
Ack! (Does 22 quality as "old" to a 15-year-old...?)
(Hey, you're older than I am!)
Thick leather gloves and sunglasses... Maybe I'll try these on... ...On second thought, no. They might be evidence for one of Prosecutor Gavin's cases.
A delicious bowl of stew! ...Made of plastic. Huh, the bottom of the bowl has a "G" on it. They sell these at concerts? Whatever happened to T-shirts?
Chains dangle from the ceiling. They aren't "glimmerous", but I bet Detective Skye'd have something to say about them.
That guitar looks like it was made out of a cop car door. ...... That's right. Trucy's not here to set me straight. Now I feel kinda lonely.
There's graffiti on the mirror... in lipstick. Wait, but the Gavinners are all guys. ...Maybe Prosecutor Gavin wears lipstick?
A police uniform. Next to it is a policeman's hat, and a pair of handcuffs. One of the band members must like the police. Must be Mr. Gavin's "bad influence". ...... I thought rock 'n' roll was all about being rebellious.
A postcard of Lamiroir... I can't read a single word of the sentence at the bottom. Hmm. Trucy might want one of these. I'll show it to her next time we're here.
That's an odd guitar. The design is that character I saw in the hallway, but with sunglasses. What a strange mascot. He looks like he's crying. Since when was rock about crying? ...They should name this guy "Emo".
An old-fashioned speaker hangs from the ceiling. That must be to monitor what's happening out on stage. I think we had the same kind for my school's P.A. system.
...That police officer looks ready to rock. Some kids must see this and actually want to be cops. Somehow I don't think a rocking defense attorney would work too well.
Detective Skye! (I'll let that "Wright kid" business pass.)
That's a new one. So, um, Ema, what are you doing here?
Security...? Did something happen?
(...He is a big rock star.)
So... Where's this door here lead to?
(Is she ever in a good mood, I wonder?)
What's that odd looking doll doing there?
Could you try either talking or munching, but not both?
(She hit me with a snack.)
...... (Sorry, I don't speak Snackoos.)
What's this? Some kind of headset earpiece?
Why would someone leave this in the hallway?
Maybe Lamiroir's bodyguard dropped it?
Ema! Will you stop eating those snacks for one second and listen!?
(...At least I got her to stop munching.)
That's a pretty sturdy-looking box there. Maybe it's an instrument case. There's a guitar next to it.
I don't think I could even carry it...
(She Snackoo'd me.)
That's Prosecutor Gavin's... er, the Gavinners's dressing room.
Hold on! But I just came out of there!
(*sigh*)
Come to think of it, I am a little thirsty.
...... I think I'll get a water.
If you want tea so bad go buy it yourself!
(She Snackoo'd me.)
A Gavinners "Guilty As Charged" tour poster.
Well, this is the concert venue. It makes sense.
People like to see the poster at the concert... It's part of the experience.
(She Snackoo'd me.)
Um... Ema?
(I've never seen someone eat snacks with such vehemence. Better give her a wide berth...)
(She Snackoo'd me.)
Ema, could you take a look at this?
Um... What do you think?
(That must be a bottomless bag of snacks.)
So this is Lamiroir's dressing room.
......
What was that?
Was that... a gunshot?
(Something's going on!)
E-Ema!
(What's that awful noise... Oh, it's the concert.) Aaack! That's-- (It's Lamiroir's manager! Mister what's-his-name...)
M-Me?
R-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right?
(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)
...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
Who? Who shot you!?
Ask? Ask what?
Witness... There was a witness!? Who!?
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
(..."Siren"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Mr. LeTouse! Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?
Ema! Did you see anyone just now!?
(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)
...! (I lost him!)
(Romein LeTouse... shot. And I heard his last words... "The witness is the siren"... Whatever that means.)
Tell no one... Not even Lamiroir?
On that? Hmm... An "Investigation Request"...?
(That should be OK to sign, I think...)
Huh? Me?
(Gee, I wonder why...)
(We were all questioned as witnesses... ...And now none of us can go home. We'll investigate alright. ...Our way!)
I still can't believe I was there when it happened. Not an experience I care to repeat any time soon.
(I worry about Trucy. She seems to have a very loose idea of what it means to be an "attorney". Of course, that's not surprising considering who her father is...)
No... Let's get cracking!
(I'm the only one who was there... The only one who heard Mr. LeTouse's last words.)
(First order of business is to find out what he meant by "siren"!)
Does the Blue Badger have something to do with the band?
Huh. Go figure.
(I'll have to take a closer look at one some day.)
Not a phone, a transceiver. It's called a "headset".
Hmm. I don't think he was wearing one when we first met. (The L.E.D. on this thing is lit. It must be on.)
Looks like an instrument case. A big instrument case.
Huh? What kind?
So it's the girl who's miraculous, not the escape?
That's the Gavinners's dressing room. The crime scene was Lamiroir's dressing room... ...Next door.
(After you, Trucy, P.I.)
Lamiroir's dressing room...
We're not supposed to go in there.
Sadly, no. (Though, the situation being what it is... Now may be our best chance to do some snooping...)
...Want something to drink?
("Now in Real Steel flavor.") ...Hmm.
...Here, my treat.
The machines outside are cheaper. This one is highway robbery.
A concert poster for the "Guilty as Charged" Tour.
...Seems kind of negative to me.
It kind of loses its impact, doesn't it?
Prosecutor Gavin's probably busy with the case, too. No rest for the wicked.
I was hoping to get a chance to talk to Prosecutor Gavin...
I guess...
Look at all these electronic devices. I'm guessing they have something to do with sound.
Don't touch that!
(They should require parental testing, clearly...)
Now that's a big instrument case.
You could fit twenty violins in there, I bet.
You could fit five Trucys in there, I bet.
Look, a ladder. I guess they need one to work on the lights and such.
Not wrong, just... well, why do you prefer stepladders?
...... (I prefer my ladders rigid and stable, thank you.)
Yeah, like a real pianist.
...Good thing Mr. Wright didn't hear that one.
The lights were so bright I couldn't see the whole first part of the concert.
Just hold back on the lights, for my eyes' sake, please.
You probably don't want to blind the audience if you plan on showing them magic.
You have to let us investigate the scene, please!
(LeTouse did tell me to ask the witness, the siren... ...With his dying breath, no less. Doesn't that count?)
Great! Let's get to it!
(She's letting us look! And she's not munching her snacks! This bodes well. There are clues here, I can feel it! Leave no hanger unhung, no spot unspotted!)
......
Ah? Um, nothing. It's nothing.
Eh.
Hmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...
......
Eh.
I know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.
(Hey! What have I done?)
It's not healthy to envy the young, Ema.
(Note to self: Ema lacks a sense of humor. Use caution.)
(...Something seems so familiar about that brooch.)
(Trucy's still after that brooch, clearly...)
(I'm a little concerned for Trucy's future... But I'm more concerned about the owner of that brooch.)
Looks like it. There are two here in the wall.
(No kidding. I wonder about this murder weapon...)
Whoa whoa whoa! Stop it! Are you two crazy? Ema, you of all people should know better...
(Please, grow up...)
Huh, another ladder.
Well hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.
(Why is the ladder there? Well, to climb, right? To reach something on the ceiling?)
What's this poster...?
...One I wouldn't mind seeing real soon.
There's another Gavinners poster here.
No tampering with the crime scene, Ema!
That speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...
Yes, I seem to recall it being loud and vaguely musical. (It made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.)
Um, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those.
Great, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.
What an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.
What happened to preserving the crime scene, Ema?
(How scientific...)
This is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers?
Um, no thanks.
Me!? No, you should go first, Trucy, really...
(She's munching on Snackoos again. Hope she's not too annoyed.)
Hmm. He's holding something.
You can throw all the snacks at me you'd like, Ema. But sooner or later... you're going to run out of them.
...A key ring?
(What an unusual key ring... And what unusual keys. This could be a vital clue.)
The body was holding a key ring...
It doesn't look like the kind Mr. LeTouse would use. So the question is, whose key ring is it?
...... (I'm glad it brings them so much joy to mock me.)
...Says who? (Something is strange about this blood, though... Is that what it looks like?)
Seeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room.
Look at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.
This is the murder weapon, isn't it? This revolver...?
......
I didn't...
I know, I know! No one here thinks you did it, Ema.
(Hey! What have I done?)
A 45-caliber revolver, very deadly.
Huh?
Wow, chalk one point up for forensic science.
It's barely big enough for me to get my head through.
Right, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)
Lamiroir. No one here might have had a motive, but she's from...
Urk! H-Hey, it was Ema's idea!
(Always with the snacks...)
Which is why whoever it was used a revolver, I'm guessing.
That's true. It was us who found the body.
Hey, I wish I was watching the concert. ...Anything would be better than this.
And when we heard the shot and entered the room... ...the killer was already gone.
Hmm, that window is a little too small, isn't it?
(The mystery of the disappearing killer...)
Well... it's pretty big. And heavy.
Really?
...Um, and that's not a problem?
Strain...?
(Used to shooting a high-caliber weapon? Hmm...)
Huh?
(...Come to think of it, why do I carry this around? Though I suppose that's one compliment it's got me.)
So this... is the murder weapon? (This revolver is incredibly heavy!)
What's odd?
Strange...?
(A self-styled one, at least.)
A sort of pin-fastener for attaching things to clothes. Not a safety pin-type, though.
I suppose if you stuck it in your eye, then yeah, sure. But you could do that with a safety pin, too, for that matter.
(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)
Yikes! Don't point that thing at me!
I don't want it shooting any bullets, thank you!
A cat... comes out of a gun?
(Honestly, That one sounds halfway interesting.)
The middle of the weapon is a revolving chamber. That's where you load the bullets. A revolver, see?
Uh... I guess.
...... So many different words, so many different people. (...People like Trucy.)
There are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. Hmm? This middle key is shaped like... a guitar?
A guitar case key... (I'll bet I know who this belongs to.)
(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)
I guess you're right.
Huh? Oh, actually, we have to--
...She left.
Great. Now how am I supposed to investigate?
Huh? Go?
Well, that's true, but... ...On second thought, why not. I'm sure everything will be fine.
...... That air vent bothers me. If Ema and I came in through the door... That makes that vent the only exit from the room.
Hmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...
......
Eh.
I know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.
(Hey! What have I done?)
No snatching people's brooches.
If there is, you can't have that one either.
...I think the word you're looking for is "principled".
Looks like it. There are two here in the wall.
Not necessarily... Some revolvers can put a bullet through a person. So it wasn't necessarily a miss.
Better not. Ema will find out. Somehow, she will. "How could you eat those without telling me!?"
(I don't think that's the issue here...)
Huh, another ladder.
Well hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.
I'd say this ladder is used to climb up to reach things. ...Is there something on the ceiling?
Look, there's another Gavinners poster. Ema didn't seem too happy about it.
You walk around with that thing and she'll sniff it out.
(It's probably wise to be wary of Ema...)
That speaker was blaring when it happened. Apparently, it monitors sound from the main stage. ...Which made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.
...And this would have helped me hear him how?
Um, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those. Someday when I'm a famous attorney, I'll get one...
Great, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.
What an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.
..."Dazzle-frazzle"?
Um... Who taught you to say that?
(...I knew it.)
This is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers? It's one of those permanent hair things.
Want to?
(It's... just a hat, Trucy.)
The body was holding a key ring...
If it's not Mr. LeTouse's, that seems like a possibility.
Seeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room. Look at all that makeup.
(I guess she's not into makeup yet.)
Look at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.
That's pretty cool.
(That's called getting paid, and I certainly hope I do.)
A 45-caliber revolver, very powerful. This is definitely the murder weapon.
Someone unusual, that's for sure.
Me either. Unless it's in court, of course!
It's only big enough to stick your head through. And it doesn't even open all the way.
Right, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)
Who's there!?
He was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?
(Whoever that was, he sure looked suspicious!)
I have a hard time thinking of "Klavier" as anything but a prosecutor, honestly.
Probably the case, I'd bet.
This is hardly the time...
Ah, um, hiya. ......
Sorry. Wait... You were what?
What did he just call him? "Detective...?
Uh... H-Hello. ("Criminal Affairs"!?)
(Something tells me that's about to be remedied.)
Um, about the crime...
The murder, what else!?
Huh?
Well, what to do next. We've already checked out the scene. (Prosecutor Gavin may be right. We might be the most informed, for once.)
Um... I know America exists.
The Police?
...Um, OK.
(I'd hope murder would be a bit more off-putting than a ruined concert...)
(Great, I love nothing more than questioning tormented artists.)
(Aren't we supposed to be investigating a murder...?)
I'm more concerned with the other criminal. The one who kills people.
(I guess rock 'n' roll comes before prosecuting.)
Huh? Me!?
But how...?
(I guess... I'll admit, this looks kind of fun.)
(Sliders and the bar, got it.)


This part sounds a little off.
Yes?
(How'd he know!?)
(Yeah, yeah, I know you sold a bazillion records.)
Actually, it's probably better if you stay quiet... (Let's give this another shot.)
This part is off.
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to ask about the concert. It's starting to feel like we're just wasting time.
(I still can't get over the title for that song... ..."Guilty Love"...?)
(Best to avoid bringing up that topic again... I'm sure I can think of something else to ask about.)
You were saying something about your motorcycle not starting?
The key ring...
(Prosecutor Gavin's key ring... disappeared?)
Wait, this guitar wasn't the one that...
Strange days, indeed.
What's wrong, Trucy?
Huh?
(...The name's Apollo, but yeah, I agree... Don't leave us in the dark! What are you talking about?)
Um, well...
You know, something was bugging me, too! That key ring, and the guitar, and the body...
Huh?
E-Evidence!? (Ack! I'd better think of something pronto!)


The connection... is this! Right?
(Oops. Try not to anger the Trucy, Apollo. No sudden motions... Just find that evidence slowly.)
It's this, isn't it?
...I just don't see the connection. Sorry.
Wait... You don't mean this, do you?
First, the key ring was stolen.
That's right here! "When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight." This is a "heart" holding "keys"!
"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away..."
"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away..." But... But that's crazy!
Huh?
But who would go through all that trouble...?
(She looks pleased...)
Um, I was wondering if you knew anything about this?
Does it look familiar?
(I knew it...)
Yeah, I know.
Erm, actually, the victim was holding it. Like he was trying to keep it from the killer. Even if it meant his life.
Indeed.
Ema was right about the fop, I'll give her that.
Maybe he was trying to tell us something? Maybe that Prosecutor Gavin is the killer?
(Funny, I always thought of Prosecutor Gavin as one of those cool, stoic types. The sort that never complains. How wrong I was!)
The key ring might have been dropped by accident.
That's true. (Prosecutor Gavin's as calm and collected as ever...)
Why would anyone do that?
Maybe this is the real Prosecutor Gavin we don't get to see in the courtroom.
Ja... (I guess this is all we're going to get from Prosecutor Gavin. That leaves Lamiroir to question.) Prosecutor Gavin... do you know where Lamiroir is now?
(The Gavinners's dressing room. Got it!)
Um... I know America exists.
The Police?
...Um, OK.
First, the key ring was stolen.
"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight." This is a "heart" holding "keys"!
"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away..."
"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away..."
So this song prerdicted everything that was going to happen!?
Huh?
(She looks pleased...)
Who's there!? ...There he goes again. Who is that guy!?
Huh? Trucy?
...So he is a friend of yours!
(Curiouser and curiouser...)
There are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. And this guitar-shaped key was the key to a guitar case.
...So he could slap handcuffs on you after you opened it?
(I'm glad she's on my side.)
L-Lamiroir! You speak? I mean, you speak English?
Then, your pianist is also...?
Trucy!
Remember what Prosecutor Gavin said? "Not a word"!
(Precisely who Prosecutor Gavin doesn't want to alert, I'd suspect.)
I'm sorry, we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Do... you think I could ask you some questions?
(She's as calm as she looked on stage... I can't put my finger on why, but I like this Lamiroir.)
Um, what seems to be the problem?
Uh, sure, of course.
What are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.
("A landscape painter in sound"...? That's a nice image...)
("A landscape painter in sound"...? That's a nice image...)
The Republic of Borginia... that's in Northern Europe, right?
Producers tend to look for talent, Trucy. ...Lamiroir, you're not from Borginia originally? Were you born here?
Oh, is that supposed to be a secret?
Image is important, I guess.
A painter in what?
Stop while you're ahead, Trucy.
He's very "European".
I noticed he hardly leaves your side.
He doesn't speak English, either, does he?
New?
Interpreter... even though you speak English.
I-I'm sorry... Prosecutor Gavin said we weren't to talk to anyone...
The "siren"... That's what he meant!
You are "the Siren", right Lamiroir?
...It's very important. I had to know for sure if the "Siren" was you.
...I'll tell you. You deserve to know.
"Siren"... It turns out that's a very important word in this case.
When we found Mr. LeTouse... ...he was still alive.
I heard him say something... ...his last words.
Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
I was the only one there to hear it... ...but I'm sure that's what he said!
And you're the Siren, Lamiroir.
Did you see what happened?
That reminds me... Does this brooch look familiar to you?
Yours, Lamiroir...?
(So this brooch belongs to her... That begs the question...)
(...What was this brooch doing at the crime scene?)
(So it's Lamiroir's brooch, which begs the question... ...what was it doing at the crime scene?)
Would you mind taking a look at this, Lamiroir?
Ah, don't worry about it. (Certainly one of the most pleasant refusals I've had.)
Lamiroir...?
Eh! Uh, well, no. I'm a defense attorney.
...Is that a problem?
Ack... (Why...? If she witnessed the crime, why won't she tell us...?)
...I believe so.
Whoa! Who's there now!?
Ack! Ema! ...Is something wrong? (She's looks grumpier than usual.)
(Oops. Maybe this is about us leaving the crime scene.)
Ah... Prosecutor Gavin.
I heard Mr. LeTouse's body has gone missing...
(How could Mr. LeTouse's body just "disappear"?)
There should be a body here. But there's not. How could this have happened? And why?
...Sorry. (Not much else I can say.)
(You should watch your sugar intake, Ema.)
Ema, could you take a look at this?
Um, it's not a bag of Snackoos.
(She would be more convincing if she wasn't standing around eating her precious Snackoos.)
Something is definitely different here.
That's the tower that Lamiroir and Prosecutor Gavin were singing on.
...... Maybe we should get Ema.
(I'm... not so good with heights.)
Urk...
(It didn't look that high from below, really. But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those 20 feet down. Of course, I wasn't thinking about the height any more. Not after what we found up there.)
(We found two things we were looking for, and one thing we never expected to find.) ...The body, guitar in hand, and the pianist, Machi Tobaye.
Wow, that concert last night sure went south in a hurry!
Don't look at me like it's my fault! (Machi Tobaye, the blind pianist... ...arrested on suspicion of murdering Romein LeTouse.)
I guess they had proof of some kind.
P-Prosecutor Gavin?
Don't look at him like it's his fault either.
What do you mean by the "circumstances"?
Well those are circumstances, alright. But what makes Machi the only possible suspect?
Ah. Right. (I think I like this side of Prosecutor Gavin better, actually.)
What... did you just say? Me? The defense attorney?
He...? You mean Machi? Machi wants me...?
Uh... Right...!
R-Right. Later! (I hope I'm up to this...)
...You said that already.
Um, h-hi. Maybe you can tell me about last night...
(That was when I realized how tough it must be... A little kid like this... ...in a country so far from everything he's ever known.)
But didn't Prosecutor Gavin say she was with him?
That's, um, a good question. (I can't think of anything we can do but go with this. ...And hope for the best at the trial tomorrow.)
No clues here.
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Um, what are you talking about?
The Chief Justice...?
Ah...
(She's looking at me with something like... disgust.) ...Hey! What are you looking at me like that for!?
...!
Yeah, apparently, weapons that size have a powerful kickback. If, say, the judge tried to fire one, it'd break every bone in his body.
(Ema seems... tired, somehow.)
(I'm sure that makes her feel much better.)
Yeah, pretty much.
Looks like we need a bit more information.

The night of the murder was the night of the concert, yes?
What was a detective doing on security detail, might I ask? ...If it was only a concert?
Prosecutor Gavin...?
Conspiracy...?
Isn't it possible he simply misplaced them?
Does everything with this guy have to be so over-the-top?

...We were let in, though.
Gee, great.
(So no other "outsiders" were there, then.)

I believe we were having a chat when we heard the shots.
Yes, absolutely.
Ah, thanks. So...MUNCH...how about it ...MUNCH...Ema?

Rock?
(That's right, when we went into the dressing room... ...music was blaring over the speaker on the wall.)
Did it have to be so loud?

How could you know something like that!?

B-But that air vent was too small! Who could possibly...
...!
A child...

B-But that's just conjecture!
...!
Evidence...? What!?
Wait, what...!?
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Urk...!
......
(So this was his decisive evidence...)
(I know the circumstances under which the body was found... I was there.)
I'm sure they have a good reason. (They must have had a good reason to arrest Machi... ...And I'm going to find out what it was!)
!
Ugh...
(Argh! It can't be over already!)
I know! I know! (Think! What can get us out of this!? We need evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi is innocent beyond a doubt. Without that... *gulp*)
(This is it... and so soon! If I mess this one up, it's all over...!) The court wants contradicting proof?
The defense is prepared to show contradicting evidence!

This evidence does more than contradict, it flips the whole case on its head!
(Ugh... I guess that wasn't it.)
(Grr! There's only one way out of this... Evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi's innocence beyond a doubt.)
I... don't have contradicting proof, actually.
What the heck are you talking about!?
(She's right... If we give up here, we're finished. I need proof or a witness... I must have something...!)
Prosecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime. Are you absolutely sure?
That's too bad, because there was a witness.
Because I am the only one in the world who knows this.
(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)
...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
What do you mean by that?

But it's the truth! He said it! I even told you about it! But apparently, you ignored me completely.
(Urk! There's no backing out now!)


Well, actually... (Uh oh. I can't think of anything.)
(Why's he pointing at me!? Think, how can I get him to accept there was a witness? I need some kind of proof...)
Recall Mr. LeTouse's last words.
That's right. The "Siren of the Ballad"... Lamiroir! Lamiroir was only on stage for the second set... ...and she had access to the backstage area. She could have been a witness!
(Lamiroir would say nothing the night of the murder... Not today, though. Today we'll drag that story out of her no matter what it is!)
...? (What does she mean, she doesn't know...?)
What's that?
Ugh...
(I hope he was too distracted to hear what she was actually saying...)
Grr...
(Lamiroir wouldn't talk to me the night of the crime. She must know something, and I've got to find out what!)

But you must have seen something! Mr. LeTouse named you!
Lamiroir! He said you were a witness with his dying words!

It... It was a great concert.
I was hoping to get an autograph later, actually...
(Apparently his grandson is a big fan...)

You did not return backstage once? Where were you then? What were you doing?
And was Machi with you at the time?
(So much for an alibi for Machi...)

I'm sorry Lamiroir, but I'm having trouble believing you.
You remember this brooch, do you not?
...Care to add that to the testimony, Prosecutor Gavin?
This brooch was found after the murder took place. ...At the very scene of the crime!
...Lamiroir. How did your brooch get backstage if you did not go there yourself? And, as Prosecutor Gavin has just told us... ...you had been wearing it during your performance that night!
Lamiroir...?
That trick's not going to work here!
What now?
Wh-Whaat!?
(Is she really saying all that?)
Right when the incident occurred... Ah! (Is she talking about that!?)
R-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right? Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
(..."Siren"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?
Ema! Did you see anyone just now!?
(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)
But that's ridiculous! You only looked in for an instant, but you dropped your brooch?
!
Ugh...
(That's too convenient... She's hiding something!) Lamiroir! You did look into the room though, right?
Testify as to what you saw!

What did you see in that brief glimpse?
(It's my Chords of Steel, man. Just back off!)

A wall...? Was there a wall there?
(And the murder took place in the inside half. I guess that partition might have hidden the body...)

"The late Mr. LeTouse's body", you say?
You know something more about Mr. LeTouse's death than you are saying.
I could see you trying not to remember... But the effort made you swallow! ...You can't fool my eyes.
One moment, Lamiroir.
What was that you just said? "Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?"
(She was hiding something, I knew it!) Lamiroir, I'm afraid you haven't realized it, but... ...your words just now contradict your testimony!
(...Take this! Lamiroir contradicted her own testimony, and I have the evidence to prove it!)


Huh?
(Ack! Wrong evidence! Gotta think this over... What did she say again? "Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot"? That's right... That totally contradicts her testimony!)
Tell me, Lamiroir... How did you know he had been shot?
Immediately following the incident, a gag order was placed on the scene. This is the document proving that. In your testimony, you told the court... "No one told me anything about the incident."
Furthermore, you testified that you had "seen nothing".
Yet you knew that Mr. LeTouse had been shot! How could you have known!?
(That sweet song of hers was sounding a little too sweet!)
She saw something, I know it. Even the victim said so!

Only a glimpse, yet you knew they were bullet holes?
(Hmm. Maybe I should go on a Chords of Steel tour, too.)


With Machi, correct? How was he then?

How was the incident explained to you?
(Think, what doesn't ring true about her testimony?)
She might not be lying, but she's hiding something... (What wouldn't she tell me the night of the murder?)
Lamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad... ...but lies are hardly becoming of such a creature.
(C'mon, can't I be cool for once!?) Observe the diagram! Lamiroir, you looked in from the door for just a moment. Correct?
There were bullet holes in the room, yes. But they were in the wall the door is on!
You see? Assuming you merely glanced into the room... ...you couldn't have seen those bullet holes!
But she knew how Mr. LeTouse died! And he named her as a witness! You must have seen something, Lamiroir!
......
(This whole thing smells fishy... That's what's wrong.)

So you were heading toward the dressing room?
(So this is a little before she opened the dressing room door and dropped her brooch. ...About the same time Ema and I heard those shots.)

Um, what exactly is something like a little window?
(That little window on the wall...)

You are certain you heard two shots fired?
(And there were two bullet holes at the scene... no contradictions so far.)

It wasn't Machi who shot... Are you sure?
Trucy... Let's just listen to what Lamiroir has to say. Can you tell me how you were so sure?

I'm not so sure it's all that simple, Trucy. (There's a critical flaw in this testimony... And I have to point it out, even if it isn't good for our case...)
A "grown person"... That's a little vague.
Voice...?
......
...Well, I'd have to say it's pretty good. Vital, even. This shows that the shooter wasn't Machi...
...!
Wh-Why not!?
Though it pains me to say this... ...There's something about Lamiroir's testimony that rings false.
(I'm sure you remember what the problem is as well as I do, Gavin.) As has been established... No grown man could pass through that air vent. He couldn't have fled the scene of the crime.
I know, and I know it's bad for our case, but I can't shut my eyes to this. (Believe me, the idea was tempting...)
Wh-What next!? (What's he talking about?)
(How come no one bats an eye when he says stuff like that?)
The state of the room...?

B-But she's the only eye-witness we have!
Th-That's right! That's what Mr. LeTouse...
B-But if Lamiroir can't testify...

Wait! Let me hear Lamiroir's testimony one last time...
(Grr... I hope I didn't just miss my only chance.)
The circumstances...? (Again...?)
(She's right... Why did Mr. LeTouse's body disappear from the room... ...and end up on top of that stage tower? ...Holding a guitar, no less.)
Lamiroir's... song?
Its "code"...?
Then Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flames on stage. Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet...
(I admit, I'd forgotten about the song... But there it is now, waiting for me... the grand finale, as it were.)
(I'm not so sure I'm going to be doing much singing...)

Who would steal a body just to match some lyrics!?
(What would Wocky have said? ..."That concert was wack.")

Does the prosecution have any idea why he'd do all this?
A deep reason?

But... Mr. LeTouse spoke English! He may have come to this country before!
Oh.
(Great...)
(And I'd never heard of them. What does that say about me?)

What do you mean by his "signature"?
The bullet holes...?
No! Y-You can't be serious...
(I knew those bullet holes would come back to haunt me. Think Justice, what do I do now!?)
(He couldn't see, so the first shot missed... ...As explanations go, it's airtight.)
Sure, there were bullet holes left in the wall... ...but that doesn't prove the shooter couldn't see!
Well, there could have been a struggle with the victim.
And... it might have been the revolver's fault.
The revolver was a very large caliber, correct?
...Exactly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye, is, as you can see, tiny. It's not so hard to picture him firing the gun and missing entirely! The kickback alone would throw off his aim.
(Ha ha! Take that, smug prosecution!)
Huh? What?
......Oh.
Yurk! Uhh... (Cripes! I really put my foot in it this time!)
By "signature", you mean the bullet holes in the wall?
(Why's mine frozen in my veins, then...?)

But, but you can't say that for sure!
What's so scientific about a murder to lyrics!?
(Put that bottle of finger-printing powder down before you hurt someone, like me!) OK, then explain it! Scientifically!
(Hah! Likely story...)

You can't say he was blind just because of those bullet holes in the wall! I think I've proven that!
Huh?
...!

But wait! If he was blind... ...how would he know about the air vent in the first place?
(He certainly seems sure of himself...)
I don't believe it.
But that's... Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this!?
(I've never seen Prosecutor Gavin so... so aggressive! Maybe he's caught the scent of blood...)
(Proving the shooter was sighted would do it. That would take down one of their central points... Do I have any evidence that can prove that though...?)
(I can't think of anything that proves the shooter could see!)
(I couldn't even get a word in edgewise...)
Fine... I accept the prosecution's challenge.
(What exactly am I up against here...? The prosecution is saying the shooter missed because he or she couldn't see... Therefore, Machi, who's blind, did it.)


(Ugh. Wrong evidence, I'm guessing...)
(I have to think! There must be something... anything!)

The prosecution holds that the "shooter couldn't see".
Apparently not thorough enough. I have a certain piece of evidence that completely overturns your claim!
No, it doesn't.
(First, we don't panic. Even though Machi's case is leaking water by the gallon. Gavin's on a roll, and it's up to me to stop him!)
This is that evidence!
(I don't care much for the smirk on Prosecutor Gavin's face... But this is no time to think twice... Time to press on!) Yes, Your Honor, the crime scene. There is something in here that decisively contradicts the prosecution's point!


Look! The contradiction's right there! Plain as day!
(Ugh... What a time to mess up.)
The contradiction is right here!
(Thanks for making my point for me...) Yes, in fact, that's what I think happened here.
Um... No one has anything else to say?
So the prosecution accepts this? You agree this was the victim making an attempt to record the name of the killer? ...And that the killer tried to rub the name out?
What's my point!? Let me ask you this: How did the killer know the victim was writing their name?
But what did you just testify about the shooter?
Yet the crime scene itself contradicts that! The killer had to have been able to see! Why would they rub out the name in blood otherwise?
May I remind the court that the defendant, Machi Tobaye, is blind! He couldn't have been the shooter!
(I... I'm not sure I like the vibe I'm getting here.)
Wh-What did he say?
(No way...)

B-But you said...
!
Bu-But that's...
Ack...!
Urk...
Yeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggh!
(He's angered the Trucy now. Look out...)
(Ugh, don't say that...)
"Ah ha" what?
That seems to be what happened, yes.
...! Really...? You can do that?
Huh? I have to do the test?
(A chemical that reacts to blood... I've heard of this somewhere.)
(...The eyes of the entire court are focused on me!)
(Ugh... Grrrah! Let's do this!)
(Wow... it really works!)
...So what is it?
Why would Mr. LeTouse even know a number like that!?
(Why did LeTouse know an Interpol ID number...? That's what I want to know.)
...What are you talking about?
Huh? Me?
(He's known from the start of the trial. He's been leading us on the whole time!)
(What does that have to do with anything!?)
It wasn't for himself...!?
(Machi had no reason to pretend he couldn't see... Which means... No. It couldn't be!)
(Grr... Why can't I figure these things out on my own? I hate having to take my cues from this guy.) ...Very well. Look at this. This is why he was pretending he couldn't see!

Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye. Recall their relationship. In particular, their unique arrangement over the years before visiting our country.
That's right. Because he was "blind". She led him at all times, never letting him go.
Yet, we have just learned something that makes their arrangement peculiar indeed. Machi could see! Why did they have to keep up this act the whole time?
I think there's a simpler explanation. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. That can only mean one thing.
Really. It was all the other way around. The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!
Yes, Your Honor. Lamiroir is blind.

Well, see, it... (...is the wrong piece of evidence.)
(Keep it up wise guy...)
Aaaaah! You don't mean---!?
...... (I have no idea!)
(Keep it up wise guy...)
Aaaaah! You don't mean---!?
Don't ask me! I had no idea she couldn't see... I hadn't even imagined it until now!
(Those eyes... She really can't see? Really?)
...!
...? What's that?
Ah...
I think we're all a bit lost here, Your Honor.
...... I'd like to cross-examine.
There was one thing in her testimony that bothered me.
...OK. (There was only one part that bothered me... Just let me ask about that and I'll be happy.)

So, you don't know why you went blind?
(Hey! Why I oughta... take a deep breath and calm down.)

Weren't you nervous to hit the stage in your condition?
What about your PR motto?

Perhaps your music reminded him of the Borginian scenery?
The opposite?

Was that to protect your image as the "landscape painter in sound"?
I'm not sure you can compare your father to Lamiroir.

(I suppose that's her confession, of sorts. There's just one part that bothers me... ...And I'm going to get to the bottom of it.)
When you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?
(So he knew... and that's what's been bugging me!)
...!
...Yes, I was.
...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
Mr. LeTouse told me to ask the witness, and he named you.
Why would he do that? He knew you were blind!
...!
Meaning what...?
...Before? (What came before that...?) Ack!
...Urk!
Ah...
So, when he wrote those letters...
...Was just a cover, most likely.
(So the victim was an Interpol agent on an undercover op... I wonder how that ties into everything.)
Yeah, somehow...
Whaaaaaaaat!?
(The courtroom fell into such a chaotic state, the trial had to be suspended temporarily. I'd never seen that happen before. Of course, it's not every day that you get an accusation like that one. Lamiroir, fingering Daryan Crescend. Not only is he a guitarist, he's a detective! Could it really have been his voice Lamiroir heard? Things were changing fast, and frankly, I wasn't sure I could keep up with it.)
What?
Out with it. The suspense is giving me an ulcer.
Score? Um, gee... I guess I would... um, or maybe... well... ...Bah. I'm just as bad as you.
Clearly. Machi avoided a guilty verdict, which is something. Though I can't say I'm any less confused about the case.
And the victim, Mr. LeTouse... Who would have guessed he was actually an undercover Interpol agent!? ...What a mess. And we don't have any idea what he was investigating.
I don't. Speaking of mysteries, what's Mr. Wright up to? I wouldn't mind asking his opinion.
What, is he some kind of stray that just wanders in and out at will?
Top secret...?
Fine... right. Well, time's a-wasting, as they say. Let's investigate.
There are several books of magic mixed in with the legal books on the shelves. I dusted them recently. Nothing like the gleam of clean books!
Mr. Charley, the potted plant. Huh? His leaves are looking a little... brown.
Maybe you weren't giving him enough water?
Hey, don't blame it on me! You are watering him, right?
Mr. Wright has been away on his "top secret mission", no?
You know, that ring kind of gets in the way. Our client the other day tripped on it and fell on the floor.
You know how long it took to calm down the client? And in the end, they walked out without hiring us. Could you clean up a bit?
I'm not sure law offices have to be festive and fun-filled.
(I guess it is her office... isn't it?)
A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. No matter how many times I see that there, it still strikes me as... odd.
What kind of a home did you grow up in!?
I bet you would be...
A faded photograph showing one of Trucy's favorite magicians. She talks to it daily for good luck, I hear.
(I suppose if you're going to talk to inanimate objects, a photo isn't so bad.)
How is your magic act coming along?
Is that the one where the ball moves from under one cup to the other?
...It's not there.
Nice try.
(*sigh*)
That's one of those hats you pull things out of, right?
Hmm... That reminds me of a sci-fi show I used to watch.
I get the idea.
I've seen some restaurants that set out real food to show what's on the menu.
...I'm sure someone just swiped the lettuce and ate it.
Just how hard up do you think I am!?
Um, thanks. That's nice. ...But this is not the time to be drinking tea!
Lamiroir dropped a bomb in court today... "It was Daryan"...
Um, I guess.
...Somehow I don't think that means what you think it means. ...And she has to be wrong, this time.
I mean, look... Those gunshots were right during the concert!
Right... Did you happen to look up on stage? Maybe... at Daryan, even?
Right. All the Gavinners have a rock-solid alibi. He couldn't have shot Mr. LeTouse backstage.
(Somebody's either wrong, or lying very badly here...)
An Interpol agent... hmm.
Huh? Interpol? They're the guys who catch international criminals.
Yeah... ...Anyway, you think he was investigating Lamiroir?
Don't be fooled by appearances is all I'm saying.
If only it were that easy. ...In any case, we know he was working on something.
Something like that. ...Frankly, the whole thing is making my head hurt. (What was Mr. LeTouse up to?)
...Well I'm not. So there.
......
Um, Trucy? Was that another one of your tricks?
Who's there!?
He was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?
Ah, um, nice to meet you. Who... are you? (And could you please stop smirking like that?)
Uncle Valant...? He's your uncle!?
(And could you please stop smirking like that?)
Um, I hate to intrude, but... What is a Great Magician doing paying us a visit?
(He does have a certain aura to him, it's true.)
(His "aura" sure isn't lost on our magician-in-the-making. She's practically drooling with enthusiasm.)
Wh-What? Daddy... you mean Mr. Wright...?
...! (Trucy's real father!?)
Troupe Grammarie... huh? No. But it does sound kind of familiar...
(Valant Gramarye... The name began to surface in my mind. It was a name I'd heard on television as a child.)
Um... ...You said he is a magician?
...Wait.
I do remember... seeing you on television... a long time ago. Weren't you with someone else...? Like, a duo?
Yeah, you had a partner. "Something Gramarye"...
? Why's everyone so quiet?
Daddy...? (Huh!? Oh, no way!)
And this Zak was...?
(Trucy's father, a magician... I guess it makes sense.) ...I had no idea.
...Oh, I'm sorry.
Glad that I'm good for comic relief, at least.
Ack! No evicting, please! (...Are all magicians like this, I wonder?)
Reasons?
...Not one for modesty, are you?
Um, I'm his defense attorney, actually.
(There are more mysterious things than her song going on... Way more mysterious...)
(This Valant Gramarye has good reasons to be here today... But I wonder what his "reasons" were to be at that concert?)
So, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there...
What about Lamiroir vanishing and reappearing!?
(So young to be so jaded...)
So you're the one who knows how it was all done.
Um... Well... Do you think you could... ...tell me how it was done!?
Trucy...?
Not during a murder investigation, it's not!
Also what?
Oh.
(Grr. Whose side are you on?)
So... you'll be at the concert venue today?
(With a whir of his cloak, and a wink of his eye... ...he turned and walked out through the door. Normally.)
...Right. (Valant Gramarye... I've got a few more things to ask him. Foremost among them, that bit of magic that made Lamiroir disappear... ...And how he knows Trucy, and her "real" father...!)
So this photo is of your father, Trucy?
(No wonder she's so devoted to her art...)
Uh, yeah... (Is that how it really happened?)
(Machi may not be guilty, but he's still a suspect.)
Yeah, but only someone as small as him could have gotten out of that room.
And... he lied.
(Machi Tobaye can see...)
Speak of the devil.
I forget. Why did we come here? It's not like we can talk to him or anything.
It's kinda hard to build a court case on feelings. But, since we're here, anyway. Might as well get what I want to say off my chest.
(I think she's actually worried for me...)
That security camera is looking at me. Why do I feel this sudden urge to make a silly face?
A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. His eyes when he looks at Machi are gentle. Maybe he has a kid the same age.
Hey, all's well that ends well. You have to be more goal oriented. If he's not guilty, we win.
...! (Huh...?)
Daryan of the Gavinners... The detective. I wonder if Machi knows what happened?
I mean, if he could follow how the trial went at all. If no one told him there's a new suspect, how would he know?
Hey...
No... It's nothing.
(...Yeah, I guess it does...)
...This is why I never trust a translator.
...I must be imagining it.
It's just, I couldn't help but feel that... I dunno. Machi... ...He doesn't understand what we're saying, right?
Yeah, but my bracelet is reacting to him.
Was I that bad? (Machi lied about not being able to see... But what if that's not all he lied about?)
(I think it'll take something big to get to him... Some kind of undeniable evidence.) ...We'll be back, Machi.
The weather matters for an investigation?
Um, sure. Let's get started, shall we?
Um, what stuff?
I did enough at home, thanks.
I'm happy in the courtroom, thank you. I am a lawyer.
Look, the weather has nothing to do with lawyers. Let's get going already!
Those balloons next to it have ad banners on them.
Oh. It's an ad for the department store next door.
What's that... creature there?
Eh? It's life size!
...I'd run from that thing even if I wasn't a criminal. Why does its head wobble like that when it walks? It's freaky.
Sunshine Coliseum sure is living up to its name today.
Battle?
Um, they don't do gladiatorial contests at these places any more, Trucy.
(Sometimes I worry about her.)
Look, a massive sign for the "Guilty as Charged" Tour. A giant Prosecutor Gavin stares out over the arena.
Um, where would you put it? You couldn't even get that thing through the front door.
Just as long as no one comes expecting us to prosecute.
(Is this part of some twisted plan of hers to make her singing debut, I wonder?)
Lamiroir! I'm sorry about today... I...
(Ears that heard the crime taking place... Or so she claimed yesterday. ...But how?)
That would be the Blue Badger, the police mascot. There's a guy outside in a giant Blue Badger costume, lumbering about... He stands out even more than those Gavinners posters.
I can't picture Prosecutor Gavin going for that kind of thing.
It's small. Maybe no one's noticed it.
(It does stick out in my mind for some reason...)
That's the Gavinners's dressing room. They're all out on the investigation. Being backstage isn't half as glamorous without a band here.
That's Lamiroir's dressing room... and the scene of the crime. It's kind of lightly guarded for being a crime scene.
(How is Ema doing, anyway...? I hope she's not getting cavities from eating all those chocolate Snackoos...)
It's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. There it is... The "landscape painter in sound"...
Yet the way she sings so effortlessly... you'd think she had life easy. Some people are just impressive like that.
(I hope we can solve this quickly and not add to her troubles...)
The speaker here is the same as the one in Lamiroir's room. I wonder if this one was blaring as loud as hers.
...You mean equal punishment.
They found Machi Tobaye's fingerprints on that air vent.
What's with the long face?
Lackluster...?
...... Things must look different through a magician's eyes.
Don't go there. You'll get your head stuck.
Right after the shooting took place... ...Lamiroir tried to come into the dressing room, and dropped her brooch.
Yeah... Something about it bugs me, that's for sure.
Look at the way those bullets tore through this thick wall. That revolver really was something else.
Dislocating your shoulder would kind of put a crimp on your stage career.
Don't even mention it. I'm afraid he might go out and actually try it.
...I heard you the first time. It sure is a lot of fruit. I doubt anyone would miss a bit of watermelon...
Better not. They might make you pay for it. And if you have the money for that, you should probably repaint the office first.
*shrug* These could've been imported from some exotic locale, for all we know.
The shooter must have used that to climb up to the vent.
...I don't think Mr. LeTouse was shot because of the ladder.
I guess... That air vent is pretty small, after all. (Does that prove he was at the scene...? Did he escape in the time between the gunshots and us opening the door?)
It's a poster for another show. "This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'."
...That sounds so boring, it's probably pretty interesting.
How many of those did they put up, anyway?
...We'd certainly be a novelty act, if nothing else. (I'll think about it if I ever lose my attorney's badge.)
A speaker for monitoring the stage. It was blaring at the time of the shooting.
I guess they don't care about sound quality back here. As long as you can hear it... (Not that a loss of fidelity could possibly make that music worse...)
Probably a good ten years of your allowance, give or take.
...... (Five dollars a month...? Poor Trucy... Wait till she finds out you need to buy two speakers for a stereo...)
That's one of the biggest, most expensive-looking TVs I've ever seen.
"Never"'s kind of harsh, Trucy.
Same difference.
Hey, look. A part of the carpet has been torn up here.
Luminol... right.
As long as it's not us... Maybe... the shooter?
I would hope that carpet replacement costs weren't the only thing holding you back.
I have trouble thinking of flowers as being "heavy-duty".
Not flowers, they don't.
I think you mean "heady".
They still wouldn't be heavy.
What, like a magnolia made out of steel?
That's one of those permanent dryers you see in hair salons.
Do I look like a beautician? I just know they dry your hair and give you a permanent...
OK, how about a "permachine"!?
...This isn't a bad game, thinking up official names for things. Not that it makes the name actually official or anything.
...Here, have a piece of candy.
(She must not get a lot of presents... Poor girl.)
The murder weapon. So it belonged to Mr. LeTouse.
Mr. LeTouse was a big man. (But how about the person who shot him? Wouldn't they have to be about his size?)
This was the window where Lamiroir "saw" the crime from... I wish it was that simple.
Yeah, but the window was closed...
Look at all the electronics. They must be sound-related.
No, no fiddling! You'll break something.
These eggs look kind of expensive.
That's the ladder we used to climb up the stage tower. ...Not a moment I'm likely to forget any time soon.
...I'll never be able to climb a tower again, period.
Yeah. I used to not like high places. Now I hate them.
Huh, no kidding.
(...Poor guy.)
Yeah, you're right. "The Guitar's Serenade"...
I'd come to see that.
Not bad... wait. Aren't you a magician!?
(Some dedication...)
What exactly are you doing here?
Heh. You should get Mr. Wright to teach you sometime.
(I kind of feel bad for the guy now...)
Did you make that noise just now?
(Someone must have thrown this into the piano...)
What do you think that thing was doing in there?
Not to mention you wouldn't be able to play whatever notes go with the strings it was on. (But the piano was fine during the concert... That must mean it was thrown in here after Machi played.)
Like a dream...
She disappeared from the top of the tower... ...But in order to move, you would have had to use some sort of secret tunnel.
It troubles you...? Why?
(I think it's probably quicker if I just go check it out myself, thanks.)
Um, actually, yes, you're right.
...Or everyone tells him that and he made a good guess.
(I do have a vague memory of someone like that on TV...)
(When you start playing supermarket parking lots, you know you're in trouble.)
Your partner...? You mean...
(Trucy's father...)
(...Apparently someone doesn't remember it as well as they thought.)
(How do we manage to get off the topic of the case so quickly all the time?)
Um, yeah.
Ack! What'd you do with my attorney's badge!?
(He called that pouch at her waist a "topit"...? Is that some kind of magician speak?)
Ack! No, no, I was just... Um, never mind. (The way he looked at the revolver... What was that? It was almost as if he had seen one before... and maybe wasn't too happy about it.)
I was wondering about the stunt in the video, right in the middle of the song.
(So young to be so jaded...)
So! Can you tell me how you did it?
Trucy...?
Not when you're doing a murder investigation it's not!
OK, so you tell me how he did it, Trucy.
(C'mon, you're a magician! Aren't you part of the same secret club?)
(So he doesn't care about what I have to show him, I get the point...)
Don't. You might blow up the whole coliseum.
Alright, Trucy P.I., please enlighten me. What do you think this switch does?
...A switch as big as razor to turn on a razor? OK...
That was quite a statement you made today in court. ...About hearing Daryan Crescend's voice at the scene of the crime.
I'm guessing Daryan and Mr. LeTouse were talking about something?
Why didn't you call security?
Yeah... (At least, she certainly thinks it was.)
And he was playing the piano?
Is that when you started playing "opposites"? With Machi pretending he couldn't see...
(I think I see what she's getting at... ..."Machi would never harm a soul"...)
About Mr. LeTouse...
So, you had no idea?
But someone was after him... They had to know who he really was.
You have no idea?
What makes you think that?
Clouded... right.
In your heart?
(What was it that she said about not being able to remember the light...?)
Do you think your past might be related to this case?
We took a look at your performance again. It was even better the second time!
(Valant Gramarye...) I was wondering, do you think you could tell us how it was done?
I was afraid of that...
Do you think you could tell me about this?
(Maybe that explains why she didn't react when I showed her stuff the other day. She was still pretending she could see then...)
Can I ask you about this headset, Lamiroir? You said that all concert staff were wearing one?
(So Prosecutor Gavin and his lackeys had them on, too, then...)
Hmm, that makes sense. (You'd think someone would notice if they dropped their only communications lifeline. ...So why was this one lying here?)
Yes?
Device...? Maybe you mean this?
What? What did you think?
I wonder whose this is?
We'll hold on to it for you then. We'll give it to Prosecutor Gavin when we see him.
(Everyone on staff was wearing one of these headsets... This might warrant some further inquiry.)
Can I ask you about this headset, Lamiroir? You said that all concert staff were wearing one?
(So Prosecutor Gavin and his lackeys had them on, too, then...)
Hmm, that makes sense. (You'd think someone would notice if they dropped their only communications lifeline. ...So why was this one lying here?)
Why the sudden silence?
Don't be silly.
You make her sound like she's some kind of forensic investigation machine! Which is just silly. Unless... she's a super hi-tech android that runs on Snackoos! Hmm...
Uh oh... There's only one person I know who can munch with such... venom.
Hello, Ema. You're looking as grumpy as ever.
...You're talking about the blood stain Mr. LeTouse left?
Now we know that Mr. LeTouse was really with Interpol.
...Are chocolate Snackoos popular down at the precinct or something?
That's the air vent with Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.
What's with the frown?
Ack! No, of course not, I just meant...
(That's not a question I want to have to answer in court.)
(I guess girls can frown, but defense attorneys can't.)
Look, the carpet's been torn up here.
...Best learn the word and not incite her wrath again.
...If only it worked that way.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
..."The Guitar's Serenade", you mean?
Don't ask me. I didn't do it.
(Sometimes I worry about that girl.)
C'mon, it was just a few sparks.
Anyway... Now we know this is a remote for an igniter.
Well?
(It kind of seems unlikely anyone would use this on stage...)
Huh?
(I guess there really isn't a need for me to carry this around. Though it seems to have made a decent impression...)
(She may be a snacking fiend, but sometimes, she actually makes some sense.)
Which means it belonged to Mr. LeTouse. He must have had it to begin with.
So, if it was Machi... Are we saying Machi stole it from Mr. LeTouse...?
(Now that's really hard to imagine him doing...)
Do you think you could take a look at this?
Do you think you could take a look at this?
A signal... You mean an electronic signal?
Say, Ema... You know that "strange object" you said you found?
Let me try pressing this switch...
...Ack!
Hey, don't look at me like that. I didn't do it on purpose!
I'm not out to get you, promise.
(I've never seen someone munch so furiously. Better stay clear for a while.)
Do you think you could take a look at this, Ema?
Ema...?
(Her rate of chewing is increasing... Better back off before it's too late!)
We're off to look for more clues elsewhere, then.
(I'd like to know a bit more about igniters myself...)
This switch triggers an igniter.
You're scaring me. If Ema hears you talking like that she'll arrest you.
... I said she'd arrest you, not me. And she's not some kind of mad scientist.
All these little parts... It's pretty complex. I'm guessing this is where the fire comes out. Other than that...
Not really a saying you want to go around repeating, Trucy.
Not many people are these days, it seems.
Um... that's right. (The music was blaring when we heard those gunshots... ...And found Mr. LeTouse dead.)
There's no need to yell at me... (It's Lamiroir's fault... She was the one who said she heard his voice at the moment of the crime...)
Oh, you mean the thing with the mixing board?
This part is off.
He makes his court cases on a whim sometimes, too.
(Hmm? Why does that sound strangely familiar?)
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Prosecutor Gavin around much.
The prosecutor's office... (I've never been there, have I.)
Hmm... Maybe that's not such a bad idea.
...Um, we'll be going now.
Y...Yes?
W-Well...
...!
(Detective Daryan Crescend... He's one stone I'd leave unturned if I had a choice.)
...This place is deserted.
I'm sure she's OK on her own. She seems resourceful.
It's not the band's office. It's the prosecutor's office.
...Looks like Prosecutor Gavin is on the phone.
...That's eavesdropping.
(She'd make a good reporter... for a gossip mag.)
(LeTouse...?)
Erm, hiya!
(Prosecutor Gavin, the philanthropist.)
I think he's giving us a choice. We can either ask him about the concert... or the case. (Which way to go?)
That was an impressive bit of pyrotechnics that did this.
Intriguing? (How does that guitar tie into everything that went on?)
Is that... gum?
Maybe he was chewing it when the phone rang. So he put it on the plate for later consumption.
(What is that...? It looks like a lump of plastic...?)
...Looks like Prosecutor Gavin is on the phone.
Prosecutor Gavin, does this have something to do with Mr. LeTouse?
Hey, you were the one digging for a scandal, Ms. Reporter!
Would you mind telling us what you do know about it?
Look at all the guitars! Why so many?
(I didn't just hear him say that.)
No wonder it's so hard to make it as a musician.
And breaking his guitars while he watches? That might be a little too rocking.
(What happened to Prosecutor Gavin, god of rock?)
Maybe you can get Mr. Wright to talk to them, work something out?
...Maybe I'll go have a word with Mr. Wright, too.
This display shows all the evidence for the case.
(Each monitor shows evidence for a different case. He does them all at once!?)
What would you possibly do with three television sets?
The first two seem useful, I suppose.
......
I was just wondering where the "work chair" in this office was.
...That's a massage chair, isn't it?
Try working on cases.
(Is it so hard to admit that you like staring out your window and daydreaming?)
...I read the funnies.
"Concert of Tragedy -- The Prosecutor's Deadly Song!"
(Hey!) Hmm? Is that a newspaper over there, too?
Um, thanks, but I can't read Borginian.
That makes sense. I hardly know what to think of it myself.
You co-wrote it with Lamiroir, if I remember correctly?
I think he's sort of a special case, Trucy.
You mean... this charred lump?
(What happened during that song, anyway? Why did his guitar suddenly catch on fire?)
I'm sure he doesn't mind. What more could happen to it?
Um, I still think he's a special case.
What was it that you were saying earlier? ...Something about intriguing results from an examination of the guitar?
Ah, so that's what it's called.
(Odd. That device looks strangely familiar...)
A replica... (It's a small lump, about an inch and a half long.)
You mean... whatever Mr. LeTouse was after?
(Mr. LeTouse went through all that trouble to become Lamiroir's manager... ...just to come to this country to find out more about... this lump? And he died for it.)
Ah yes, the "cursed song that turned a concert into a tragedy", wasn't it?
...It was Lamiroir singing, actually.
(......Ack! I've run out of snide comments!)
Actually, we found it at the venue and thought you might want it.
(She does look like she belongs on a stage, that's for sure.)
Prosecutor Gavin, about this remote... (Wait!)
(This remote control might be valuable ammunition for the trial tomorrow! It's too early to show my hand now...)
(It has to be one of these...)
That "device" that was found in your guitar...! ...Take a look at this.
It's an igniter.
It was at the crime scene... In Lamiroir's dressing room. Detective Skye found it, actually.
(I'm not here to get your attention, Gavin... ...I'm here to get your information.)
There's lightly scorched, and then there's this...
Yep, It's pretty much a useless piece of junk.
(Which part? The burned clean through, or the useless piece of junk?)
"Sample", huh? Think they out a big enough label on it?
Yes, they might think it was an otherwise tasty, white lump of plastic.
Sounds like a company Mr. Wright would like.
Oh.
Thanks...?
Oh. That.
(...I guess I could have hid it, but somehow, showing it felt like the right thing.) I could say the same... to you, Prosecutor Gavin.
Thanks for the information. About the, er, strange lump of plastic. The one that Mr. LeTouse was investigating.
...Especially not the ones where people are killing to song lyrics.
......
...I can live with that.
That's pretty simple, too.
The charred remains of what was once a fine guitar.
And he had it shipped back from Borginia in a vacuum-sealed case.
(...Not to mention there was an igniter placed just inside the sound hole. I wish I knew why...)
Why the sudden silence, Trucy?
(Ah, the young magician at work again.)
(There she goes...)
These guitars are vintage models. Probably pretty expensive, too.
Weren't you good at picking locks?
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
(Sorry, my little thief in the making. Maybe next time.)
That's an insanely big speaker for a room this small. Oh, look... All the CDs are Gavinners CDs.
Nah, wouldn't want to make him angry.
You just want to play with his TV. I know you.
I hate to break it to you, but it's actually a monitor. It doesn't play TV shows.
...Nope. Sorry.
(There, there, you'll get over it.)
(Who would have thought a chair could bring so much joy into someone's life.)
You know, that was a remarkably good imitation.
What floor are we on again? The view is incredible!
Uh... He's a little too small to see.
Oh yeah, that's Daryan alright.
Huh, the police must have a Borginian interpreter. That's no fair. I wish we could talk to him.
I guess so.
That security camera is looking at me. Does that thing just sit there recording 24 hours a day? It must use one of those ultra-long-play tapes.
A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I think the guard is trying to set a record for the longest time without blinking.
Hello there, Ema. What's up?
Um... well, I saw her in the backstage hallway a while ago.
(Lamiroir's missing!?)
Yeah. We'll help you look for her.
The power breaker must be off for this section... Great.
Dark... That's all Lamiroir has, when you think about it. (What would it be like to live in a world of darkness?)
Huh? What?
Changed?
(Now it's bugging me, too! What's she talking about?)
Huh. I guess someone closed it.
Something's sticking out! That... doesn't look like an instrument. You don't think it's...
Ema! We have to get Ema!
(Lamiroir was taken directly to the hospital. Ema ran around, barking orders, making phone calls. Trucy just clung to my arm and cried... And me, I was still in shock. Two bodies in two days is two too many.)
So, what happened!?
By who!?
Is that alright?
Lamiroir!
I-I'm just glad you're OK. Tell me, what happened?
The door down the hall reads "X-ray Room". I never did like X-rays... I don't think I'd enjoy looking at someone's insides. Spotting nervous tics is intense enough.
That must be a recovering patient. He keeps staring at us. What's so unusual about an attorney and a magician?
A nurse watches, hawk-like, from the reception desk. She glares at me whenever I talk. Maybe my voice carries?
Some visitors are here in the waiting room, watching TV.
Huh, looks like we're on the news.
...... Prosecutor Gavin this, Prosecutor Gavin that! Where's my fifteen minutes!?
Ah, Lamiroir, I wanted to ask you about this. Do you know what this is?
Mr. LeTouse was carrying it. It's a replica of the thing he was after.
...! You mean, you know what...
(Why haven't I heard of a Borginian Cocoon before?)
(She looks like she's had a rough day... I'll just put this piece of evidence away for later.)
The giant instrument case that Lamiroir was hiding in. Things like this wouldn't happen if people didn't make such big cases!
Don't worry. We'll find her assailant.
...You were hit?
Why the stage?
So the assailant couldn't see you!
Wow, that sounds like a really close call.
Do you have any idea who it might have been?
Too bad...
Good point... (She's sharp!)
So, that means it was likely an adult, and probably a man. (...Could it be him!?)
Hmm...
(I thought she said all in Borginia knew of these?)
...What's that?
Why!?
He was carrying a replica... but looking for the real deal. That's my best guess.
Tracking down Borginian Cocoon smuggling...
And Mr. LeTouse was placed as an undercover agent to look into it.
But... Mr. LeTouse wasn't a Borginian, was he. He was an Interpol agent, which means...
Well, there must have been some reason other countries didn't want the cocoons out. Something scary enough to get Interpol involved.
(Cocoon smuggling... And Mr. LeTouse had Lamiroir marked... Hmm...) ...It couldn't be her.
(There's one other person I need to talk to!) Thank you for talking to us, Lamiroir!
Actually, I have another request.
I need an interpreter. Someone who speaks Borginian.
Would you come with us, if you're well enough?
C'mon, Trucy. We're about to get to the bottom of this!
Machi... We came to talk to you about the case.
Could you interpret for us, Lamiroir?
Machi... I'd like to talk to you about when we first met. ...When we still thought you were blind.
Now we know the truth. You can see, right?
Machi... Isn't there another secret you're hiding from us?
What do I mean by "secret"? Well...


Do you know what this is?
I don't need a translation to understand that. I'd know that "wrong evidence" look anywhere.
(Ugh, let's try that again.)
If I'm not mistaken... ...you know something about this, don't you!?
...Trucy and I are trained to see people's uncertainty. Not that we would have needed any training to see that one.
Lamiroir, please, interpret!
I know you know something about this by your reaction. If you won't tell me, I might have to give it to the prosecution... ...and have them look into it!
...Yes, everything. Well, sort of.
It must cure some disease.
A cure for Incuritis?
OK, well, at least we know what it is: a cure. And Mr. LeTouse was after cocoon smugglers. Wait, was Machi...?
Well, you're only 15, and you're sort of a magician, aren't you?
(She said "sort of"! Oh, to have a copy of that security camera tape...)
I wonder... Do you think he brought a cocoon here to sell it to someone? If Machi really did bring one into the country... ...was he planning on making a deal for its sale?
(That's right! It's punishable by death!)
(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)
Wh-What do you mean? Visiting hours aren't over yet.
Just give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.
Huh...?
(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)
(...And there can be only one reason why.)
Oh, sorry! (This is it... I know who I'm after now. It all happens tomorrow... in court!)
Today's the day it all goes down. (And then there was yesterday...)
Just give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.
Huh...?
(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)
(...And I think I know why. Time to bring down a little Justice!)
Wh-What was that!?
...Valant Gramarye! (...Using the door like an average muggle, no less.)
A... glamour?
He sure seemed happy about that illusion thing...
So he was talking about what we saw at the concert.
And Prosecutor Gavin's exploding guitar.
Well, it's about time. Shall we go?
Y-Yes?
Huh? Did something happen? This is a first...
(Great. I bet he stayed up too late last night, watching courtroom dramas.)
The hospital?
The Chief Justice's son...
("Incuritis"...? Where have I heard that before?)
...Try not to lose the page with the funnies if you can.
The defense is prepared, Your Honor.
I-Is something wrong, Your Honor?
...And your reason is?
I sure did.
(It's true. When I heard those gunshots, he must have been on stage. Still, there's something here that doesn't quite add up...)
(Ack! But Prosecutor Gavin's case is airtight! Lamiroir might have been lying to protect Machi! How can I rely on her testimony...? Wait... What about yesterday in the detention center...?)
(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)
(Machi was trying to tell us something, I know it! ...Maybe the best thing to do is ask him... under oath!)

Your Honor!!!
Your Honor, before you declare a verdict, I would like to call another witness!
A witness who, until now, has not been given a chance to speak in this court. ...Because he doesn't speak English.
I do. The defense calls defendant Machi Tobaye to the stand!
We'll use an interpreter!
The defense would like to request Lamiroir as the interpreter.
But she'd be interpreting for the defendant! Why would she lie?
(Finally! Some progress!)
(So far, so good...)
Huh? If I would what, Your Honor?
What do I want him to testify about...? (Ack, I hadn't thought that far yet!)
How can I if I don't know what he was saying...?
(Machi wants to testify about something? What could it be?)
(Argh! The suspense is killing me...)
(What? What!?)
(This is sounding too good to believe. And I know what that usually means...)
Lamiroir! Did you ever explain the lyrics of that song to him?
......
Yes, Your Honor. (Something's hidden in that testimony, I know it. I'll just have to trust my bracelet to tell me where! It worked yesterday, it'll work today!)

Were Machi and Mr. LeTouse close?

"The Guitar's Serenade", correct?

By "could not have done it", you mean...?

Wouldn't it be difficult for him to perform without knowing the meaning of the lyrics?
(Um... OK?)

Machi... ...You can't fool my eyes.
You glanced toward her the very moment Lamiroir said the word "English". Why? And don't bother interpreting that! He understands me!
Machi, tell the truth. You can understand English, can't you?
(Must he continue this charade...?)
Huh?
What? Give me a break!
(Well, yeah, but...)
W-Well then explain this! How does he know the crime followed the lyrics!?
The newspaper!?
...... (I was right!)
(...Machi is lying! Maybe it's time to show them proof that he's lying!)


This evidence proves that you're lying!
(Urk! I must have gotten it wrong... One more time! So, he claims he read about it in the newspaper...? That means he's lying!)
I have here a Borginian Newspaper! The Borginian Daily Bugle, as a matter of fact!
Indeed, there is a feature article about the case. Could you read this for me, Machi?
That's right. It doesn't mention the lyrics!
I'm sorry Machi. You couldn't have read about the lyrics in a Borginian Newspaper!!!
So, the lyrics weren't in the newspaper and the police didn't mention them. The only place you could have heard them was in this courtroom! ...In English, no less!
You remember...?
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
(No... No! I was onto something, I know it! I can't let this chance slip away...!)
(If I'm going to keep on cross-examining, I'd better have an angle of attack... ...Or else!) ......! (My bracelet's still reacting!) Your Honor! Please allow me to continue!

Exactly how much did you explain to Machi?
(This interpretation thing is getting old fast...)
Did you mention any particular words of the song relating to the case, such as "heart"?

I believe he is, too, Trucy. I do...
(Something's hidden in that testimony... If it's the truth, I'll find it!)
Lamiroir... I'm currently cross-examining Machi. ...Why should you be uncertain?
Yes, you swallowed the very moment you told the court... ..."It was I who explained."
Lamiroir, are you, indeed, protecting someone?
Then, allow me to answer for you. Lamiroir, you're protecting...


Well...
(I don't need your pity! What I need is another chance. C'mon this is easy: Who is she protecting?)
Lamiroir, you are protecting Machi. That's why you lied and told us that you had explained how the crime followed the song!
I don't fault you for trying to help, but this is not the way!
Machi! I believe you didn't do it, really! I trust you! But you've lied to us twice. And now you have Lamiroir lying on your behalf!
If this is going to work, you have to trust me, too.
Your two lies cover a simple truth. You understand English. You have to!
Machi... could you tell us what really happened?
So, you weren't in the dressing room when I heard those two gunshots, correct?
(Which would be after the shooting, right...?)
So when Machi went into the dressing room, Mr. LeTouse had already been shot. And then we came to the door.
So it was you who escaped through that air vent!

No! He's clearly denied that he did it!
(Is that it? Is there nothing else I can get hiim to testify about? Wait... no, of course there is!)
(That cocoon has to have something to do with this!) Machi. Please, tell us the truth, for your own sake.
(Hey, you were the one who didn't believe him!)
(That's "Justice". Better learn how to say it if you ever want to get some.)
(Machi claims Mr. LeTouse was already down on the ground when he entered the room.)
You heard gunshots?
Wait, you're saying you went into the dressing room... ...and found Mr. LeTouse already dead, and THEN you heard shots? (If that's true...!)
And you escaped through the air vent.
(So the vents went to both the stage and the backstage area? Is that what he means...?)
Huh... Yeah. But how did you know it was connected like that?
Magician...?
(A magician, huh?)
Yeah, but what does that leave us with? We're supposed to say he went into the room to find the body and then he heard the shots? (That one's going to go over well in court. Not.)
Um, I'll just pretend you misheard him. Every time. So... what do we do?
(That cocoon...)
(That's right! It's punishable by death!)
(Of course... He's scared.) ...Oh well, I guess we'll just have to try a different approach.
If Machi won't testify about it, we'll have to get someone else to testify.
...I think we're out of time. Let's get back in there.
Yes, Your Honor. We had a good talk.
Your Honor, the defendant... will not testify.
Actually, it is. ...The defense would like to approach this case from a different angle, Your Honor!
(If Machi won't testify... ...then I know who will!) I would like to cross-examine the witness in this case... Lamiroir!
...Lamiroir was taken to the hospital yesterday with injuries.
She was assaulted, Your Honor.
Someone wanted Lamiroir dead. Thankfully, she was able to save herself...
Prosecutor Gavin...
Why would anyone be out to kill Lamiroir? Can you think of a reason?
Think of how she is known in our country... A singer, from overseas, who doesn't speak English, yes? Yet someone tried to keep her mouth shut! Who could that have been?
I do! It was the same person who shot Mr. LeTouse! The killer was afraid of her, afraid of what she might say! The defense believes that something was hidden in her testimony yesterday. Something that the killer doesn't want getting out!
...Exactly.
Let's review your testimony from yesterday. You told us you heard two gunshots and the shooter's voice through the window. ...And that the voice belonged to Daryan Crescend, yes?
......
I don't know exactly what, yet, but I do know there's something there!
Do I have to repeat myself? Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony!
Wh-What? Trucy?
(...Maybe I do better when I don't try to think ahead.)

......
(I raised an objection... ...but she's saying the same thing she said before...)
S-Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue with your testimony.
(You're the last person who should be pointing fingers, Mr. Rock Star...)

Daryan Crescend...?
Because the window at the scene was closed? Is that why?
(She's right. Maybe there's a different angle I can try?)
Did you happen to hear anything else at that time?
Anything else besides the victim and the shooter's conversation. Anything at all.
(Ack! I was hoping for a little more than that!)
(On second thought, maybe I'll just play it safe here. See, I can be calm and collected, too, sometimes!)
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
(Argh, so which should I be? ...Maybe I am overthinking this whole thing.)
Lamiroir, do you by any chance remember what they were saying to each other? If so, please tell us!
(I was afraid of this. She doesn't remember...)
A whole phrase!?
Why didn't you say anything yesterday!?
(This could be it! The clue I've been waiting for!) W-Well what did he say!?
The shooter, then. (Daryan Crescend...)
Urk. Um, I mean, sure...! I-I'd be delighted... It's, um, very, very vital! Maybe we could add that to the testimony!

So, you remember a part of their conversation.

And it was Detective Daryan Crescend's voice?
Yeah... what of it?
...... Daryan Crescend is a native speaker!
("Press the switch"... That's not something a killer usually says to his or her victim, is it.)


There were two gunshots...
(That fits with the bullet holes at the scene. Nothing really new here to pick up...)

Why didn't you tell someone immediately?
(That's strange... Could she be hiding something?)

You were in a hurry... to go where?
Why were you in such a hurry then?
It very well might! Please answer the question!
(Grr... What, so he can just dismiss questions he thinks are "too traumatizing"!?)
(Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony. I know she was... So something's got to be hidden here!)
I guess we'll just have to get her to fill in the blanks.
..."Press the switch." There's only one key that can unlock the mystery of those words!
True, there wasn't a switch at the scene. But, it just so happens... I have a "switch" right here.
The problem is... ...this was found not at the scene of the crime, but on the stage.
Where the concert was held, yes. This was found hidden there!
...It's a possibility.
...Why?
...Sorry, but he wouldn't have needed to shout.
You heard what I said. Or... do you need me to shout it out for you? It would have been quite simple to be heard on the stage from that dressing room. Oh, wait, you like evidence don't you? How about this! Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room.


...... (Um... Maybe I was wrong?) ...Sorry, Your Honor.
(Ha ha, very funny...)
Your Honor! If I might show another piece of evidence!!!
Neither did the shooter need to shout, Your Honor. Not with this...!
Prosecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?
This is a type of transmitter. A communications device.
From what I've heard, that night... ...everyone on stage was wearing one of these. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Gavin?
So you admit that if you were wearing one of these... ...talking from the backstage to the stage would be simple!
Look at this cross-section diagram of the concert forum.
Exactly. The walk from the stage to the backstage seems far. But the direct distance is less than thirty feet!
Well, I guess we don't...
Ugh... (I was sure this was the way to go with this...!)
...... (Wait a second... I do know what this "switch" is! And if you follow that train of logic to its incredible conclusion... ...it ends up in proof that completely changes this case!)
We know about this "switch", right? We know what it is.
Well... think of when it was used that day... Think of what happened!
...Your Honor!
I've been remiss in not telling the court this before. I know what this "switch" is.


(...Huh?)
(Ugh... I knew it.)
Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?
This... is an igniter. (What phone looks like this!?)
Yes, actually.
I am. This is a remote trigger for an igniter.
Look, I'll show you.
Er, sorry. That was a bit more fire than I'd expected.
...Prosecutor Gavin. Let me repeat myself. This switch is a remote igniter trigger.
Doesn't that suggest something to you?
Exactly. That night at the concert there was one unusual burst of flame. ...When your guitar caught fire in the middle of the performance!
Prosecutor Gavin was entirely unaware such a thing had been planned. And the guitar that burned was a valuable keepsake.
Yes?
I am. It's really simple when you think about it. Mr. LeTouse and the shooter were at the crime scene. The shooter was wearing a headset. He ordered someone on stage to "press the switch". The switch was pressed, and the guitar caught fire.
Really? It seems pretty simple to me.
......

Are you sure about that?
Maybe it's not the premise for my explanation of the switch that's at fault... ...Maybe it's our premise for the entire case so far!
I'm glad you asked. I'm saying that maybe the killing didn't take place in the third act!

Gunshots rang out... And, according to his testimony, Machi was in that dressing room at the time.
Stay with me, Your Honor! He also told us this in his testimony: Namely, that the victim had already been shot! We all heard gunshots... but no one saw the shooting!
Just before the "shooting" took place, the "shooter" was heard on his headset... ...telling someone to "press the switch"! The next moment, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. We know that a remote triggered igniter was inside the guitar. From all these facts, we can draw only one conclusion! The crime did not take place during the third act... ...but during the ballad performance... The second act!
...What does, Your Honor?
You're thinking about it the wrong way.
Look... Why would the shooter craft the events of the day to follow the lyrics anyway? It's an awful lot of trouble to go through. ...With little merit for the person doing it.
Yes, they did. A reason that made it advantageous to follow the lyrics.
...Couldn't have put it better myself. We were only meant to think that the shooting came after the guitar burst into flame! That was the criminal's objective! The crime followed the lyrics to a point, but that was the ruse! Why else would the killer risk discovery by moving the body? That was the final touch to make us think he'd followed the lyrics the whole way!
It does! The killer changed the order of events to create himself an alibi! In other words... The killer was someone who had an alibi for the third set, but not the second!
......
Flawed?
Oh...
...... (Right... Lamiroir's testimony is my entire case... ...That voice she heard... The shooter's voice...)
Look, what do we have. A man saying "press the switch!" And near the crime scene, we have a switch. Which acts as a remote trigger for an igniter. And last, but not least, Prosecutor Gavin's flaming guitar. (It can't all be coincidence! But how do I make it work?)
(OK Justice, you've got one thing to prove, and one thing only. Lamiroir heard a "voice"... ...and she heard it during the second set! Think! How was Lamiroir able to hear the voice?)
Obviously, the window was open... It had to be for her to hear the voice!
B-But...
Well, no, but...
(Grr... Time to rethink this!)
The window was closed, as you say, yet Lamiroir could still hear the voice... ...because she has the power of divine hearing! That's the only explanation!
Um, I said "hearing", Your Honor, not "healing". (Well that fell on deaf ears.)
Uh... Erm... Can we just move on now?
(Time to rethink this...!)
When we investigated the scene, the window was closed. The shooter had no reason to close it, had it been open, either. Meaning, it was impossible to hear the voice through that window.
...As I was saying, Lamiroir could not hear the voice through that window. So there can be only one explanation. She heard the voice from another location entirely!
......
...Are you sure?
Think about it... Isn't there another "small window" at the scene?
Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!


There! That's a small window!
(Not much, I know...) ...Erm, I couldn't find anything better, so...
(You're not the only one crying here...)
I know... I'm trying... (Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a "small window". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)

...The state of modern society can be read from numerous objects and artifacts. In a sense, anything can be a "window" on our society.
(No points for trying...? Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a "small window". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)
...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.
What did she tell us? She said she's a Borginian, unfamiliar with our language! It's not a stretch to imagine she called this "air vent" a "small window"!
That's the only logical explanation, yes.
OK, what about it isn't logical?
The explanation for that is simple, Prosecutor Gavin. Isn't it... Lamiroir?
You have been listening to our discussion here, yes?
The problem here is words. Lamiroir, this "small window" through which you heard the voice... Was it up high, on the ceiling of the room? Not low on a wall?
Yes, well... why the heck were you up there!?
(Well... Looks like I'm on the right track...)
...!
...I'm going to find out the truth. (...She was up above that ceiling for a reason. I just have to get it out of her.)

Above the ceiling... Could you be more specific?
Because you're bound to secrecy?
(Hmm. Doesn't sound like I'll be able to coax it out of her just by asking...)

By "small window", you mean the air vent?
(Daryan's voice...)

So, without a word, you just let the third set start?
You could have prevented this whole misunderstanding if you had only told us sooner!
(Singing without a voice? ...If only all contradictions were so obvious. ...If only I could get Lamiroir to talk. Pressuring her like this doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.)

You heard the gunshots during the second set, during your performance. ...You're quite sure?
Yes, you did... ...But you never told us why.
(Unable... or unwilling?)
We'll just have to prove it ourselves. ...As long as she is bound by this pact of silence, she won't talk. But if I can prove why she was up there, she'll have to admit it.
Yes she could.
I've got a theory as to why, too... And maybe I've got the evidence to prove it!


Exactly who bound you to secrecy?
(Interesting reaction, Prosecutor Gavin...)
(Lamiroir was bound to secrecy... ...It's going to take some hard-hitting proof to make her talk! I think I know why she was up there... but how do I prove it?)
Lamiroir, truth be told, the reason for your presence above that ceiling is quite clear. Especially when you consider what happened during your performance.
Yes. It's all right here on this video.
As we can see, Lamiroir was clearly not on stage for her entire performance!
Though it saddens me to be so realistic... Lamiroir is incapable of actually vanishing, let alone teleportation. So, the only explanation is that she was hidden from view. And during that time, she moved to the back of the forum.
Wh-What, Trucy?
But I'm a lawyer! I'm not supposed to be nice!
...This was his concert, his show. He knows how the illusion was performed.
He's just realizing his own oversight. Let's look at the cross-section diagram again. Here, we can trace a route through the ceiling... It goes from the stage, through the backstage to the rear of the forum.
Recall Lamiroir's testimony from yesterday...
Lamiroir knew of this because of her part in the illusion. But she wasn't the only one who knew.
Just now in the lobby, Machi told me something:
Oh, were you not informed, Prosecutor Gavin?
(Which is why he bound Lamiroir to secrecy...) ...Well, Lamiroir?
Why's that, Your Honor?
That... That's a good question.
Yes?
Um, what thing, Your Honor?
Ugh... (Why do I get picked on? It's Lamiroir who isn't going along with the program here!)
...Right. (I feel like a student before finals...)
(I suppose it was too much to hope that the judge would come up with something...)
...Right, Your Honor. (All I have to do is find the contradiction between what Lamiroir is saying... ...and what we can see plainly in the video.)
Well, tell me!
(Hey! You're supposed to be on my side here!)

How did you, er, proceed along this "route"?
But you arrived behind the forum much too fast to have been walking! Tell the truth Lamiroir... you rode some kind of vehicle!
(Hah hah, yes, laugh at the dumb attorney. I don't mind.)
(Argh! If it wasn't a vehicle what was it?)
(Why do I feel like I'm on some kind of quiz show?)

Did everyone on the concert staff know about the trick?
(So, not many people knew about the trick...)

So when you came back out, you were behind the audience.
(That's the part I don't get either...)

Two minutes...?
Running? In that cramped, dark tunnel above the ceiling?
Ah, that's true, but...
(Lamiroir disappears on the video for twenty seconds. But she says she made the trip in two minutes! How?)
Ack! (Evidence explaining the discrepancy...?)
(What kind of evidence could prove that...?) Um, what's your professional opinion about this one, Trucy?
And I don't work in tricks! I'm an attorney, not a magician for crying out loud!
Thanks, that makes me feel oh so much better.
(Easier said than done...)
There's one piece of evidence that explains the discrepancy between video and testimony!


(...I was kind of hoping someone else would jump in at this point.) W-Well, you see...
...Right! By which I conclude that... I was wrong.
(Was that a tear I just saw in the judge's eye? ...Alright, nothing to do but rethink this through. The key's in the video somewhere. I'm sure of it!)
Lamiroir... do you happen to remember this brooch?
It was found at the scene, Your Honor.
So did I... but we hadn't.
Take another look at the video... Here, you can see she's wearing the brooch!
Let's look a bit later.
Yes... the brooch disappeared in the short space of twenty seconds. And it takes a full minute to run from the stage to the backstage... Which means there can be only one explanation. The Lamiroir we see before the vanishing act and the Lamiroir we see after... ...are two different people!
The brooch was found on the floor at the crime scene. And not just on the floor... ...but on the floor directly beneath the air vent! Lamiroir, tell me... Did you drop the brooch on your way from the stage to the backstage? ...At the very moment you "witnessed" the crime?
So... I was right? There was a switch?
(It was Gramarye...!?) That's... quite the illusion. But I still don't get one thing...
...The switch happened before the tower rose, correct? So you weren't on the stage!
But this, er, fake Lamiroir is still singing! And she's pretty good!

All made possible by the switching trick.

And it was Daryan's voice you heard?

Hold on! I think the identity of the killer is a little more important, don't you?
(Trying to avoid the problem? This is a murder trial, the killer is the problem!)

(The contradiction between Lamiroir's testimony and the video... Unraveling an illusion can't be so different from solving a normal case... Right...?)
(...Fine, fine.)
You were... singing...?
Wait... so you were singing the whole time? Even when you were crawling above the ceiling toward the backstage!?
That... is right!
You'd have to be pretty hard of hearing to miss someone singing in the ceiling!
What state...?
The speaker!?
That speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...
So Lamiroir singing in the ceiling... ...sounded just like Lamiroir singing over the speaker.
Lamiroir?
So you...?
(The song... stopped!?)
The mixing... huh?
Oh, this! I'd completely forgotten about it... Let's take a listen!
The song does stop there!
Look at the lyrics sheet, at the top of the second verse. See where it says "Pleasure, Pleasure..."? Now listen again!
The crime didn't happen during the third set. It happened during the second, during Lamiroir's ballad.
Which means that Daryan Crescend could have done it! He wasn't on stage for the second set!
Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
!

But you have no proof...!
(...Finally! The rat's coming out of his hole! And I'm ready to catch him! Daryan Crescend, get ready for Justice!)
Why she was in that air vent... ...and that "switch" and the flaming guitar. When you link it all together, that's what you end up with.
Mr. Wright! You... believed in me?
Huh?
...Why do I even bother hoping?
Like Mr. LeTouse, only shorter and not as well dressed.
Huh? You're leaving?
What?
...Right.
...... Um... Is that all you came to say?
Yeah, but...
Daryan Crescend...
The current court system...?
So what do I do!?
Ugh...
Detective Skye... Ema!?
Under the sofa...
Right... this. (Well, finally, some evidence that makes sense...)
So... you think this was some kind of firecracker?
Did you know that in China, they use firecrackers on New Years to scare off evil? So, it's kind of same thing.
(At least my useless fact had something to do with the evidence...)
Right...
...Excuse me?
(And he walked out the door, just like... just like a magician. Normally.)
I guess we just have to take his advice, and hope it makes sense when the time comes.
(We're almost at the finish line. Hang in there, Trucy.)
That's nice, but it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. ...Correct?
(I see what you're doing, Daryan. You're "pressing" the prosecution!) ...Your Honor, if we could begin the trial?
...... (Conventional methods are out the window, huh... ...Here goes nothing!)
(He didn't waste any time finding our weak spot... I can't do this with Lamiroir's testimony alone. I'll have to find some other way to prove when the shooting took place!)

You don't have any proof she was lying!
No! I'm just saying, uh...
(I couldn't help it! I flinched by reflex!) Detective Crescend!
Um, n-nothing.
(This guy's hard as nails! He makes Wocky look downright cooperative.)

You never talked to her, even though you were playing in the same concert?
But, weren't there planning sessions or something?
Ugh...
(Lamiroir's hearing is very sensitive... She could remember him if she heard him, I'm sure of it... I just can't prove it. And I need proof!)

We know she missed the words. The mixing board proved it!
What do you mean...?
(I'm detecting a rift in the Gavinners's ranks.)

Actually... I was there, too.
Yes. We heard "gunshots". Neither I nor Ema actually saw the shooting, mind you.
(So... how do we figure out just what those "gunshots" during the third set were?)

Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.
The first was this small device...
Correct. And... one more thing.
Eh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)
This raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!
How so?
...!
Urk...! (How do I explain this...?)
Something... odd?
...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)
You could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!
Huh? For me...?
Ugh...
The other half...?
!
Uh... Yeah, I think...
It can be proven!
(This isn't going to be easy. I need some decisive proof, and fast...)

That could have been what the shooter wanted us to think!
(Ack! I'm back to relying on Lamiroir's testimony!)
Don't make us into some comedy duo.
(New facts, huh...?)

Remember this, Detective Cresend?
...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.
(C'mon, we just used this! And don't get me started on "gramophone"!) This device was used to record the performance part by part.
According to Lamiroir's testimony... At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.
...Exactly.
(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired... Find that spot, and I'll find the gunshots!)


Your Honor! Listen to this part!
(Wait, isn't the judge hard of hearing?)
(Ack! He heard me thinking!)
(Ugh... I guess that's the wrong spot.)
Ugh...
Your Honor! Listen closely to this part! This is the track with Lamiroir's vocals!
Admit it! You lost, Detective Cresend!
No, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots. But... they weren't!
And I have evidence that proves it!
The evidence showing what we really heard... is this!


This is your "gunshot"!
(Even I wouldn't stoop quite that low...) S-Sorry, Your Honor. One more time, please?
Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.
The first was this small device...
Correct. And... one more thing.
Eh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)
This raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!
How so?
...!
Urk...! (How do I explain this...?)
Something... odd?
...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)
You could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!

But the "gunshots" heard during the third set could have been...
Uh...
Well, if you know how to do that, I'm all ears.
What do you mean?
...When she forgot the words to the song, yeah.
True... Not easy, but true... (Is there some way to prove that...?)
Er, right, Your Honor! Sorry! (Just let me take a quick look through the Court Record...)

...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.
(C'mon, we just used this! And don't get me started on "gramophone"!) This device was used to record the performance part by part.
According to Lamiroir's testimony... At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.
...Exactly.
(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired... Find that spot, and I'll find the gunshots!)


Your Honor! Listen to this part!
(Wait, isn't the judge hard of hearing?)
(Ack! He heard me thinking!)
(Ugh... I guess that's the wrong spot.)
Ugh...
Your Honor! Listen closely to this part! This is the track with Lamiroir's vocals!
Yeah, because her testimony is basically our entire case.
...I've got a few ideas. (I just need to find another way to prove it didn't happen when he says it did!)
Just after that, there was a gunshot... and then the guitar caught on fire.
Lamiroir was moving through the air vent, Your Honor. She must not have been close enough for her mic to catch the first shot. But then, as she passed over the dressing room... ...the gun fired again, and Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Well, Detective Crescend?
...?
This part is off.
Wait...! You mean his playing was affected because he hurt himself shooting that revolver?
Me?
(Great, now I need to find a motive...)

Her manager, sure, but Mr. LeTouse was...
(That's cold, dawg!)

But that's the same for Machi! No motive was proven for him!
(Ugh...)


Daryan, you're a detective with International Affairs?
Even if this was Mr. LeTouse's first trip to this country... ...you still could have met him prior to the concert!
Or don't you take any international trips in International Affairs...?
What!? But you're in International...
(That's... so unfair.)

So you didn't fraternize with him at all during the concert?


...You sure about that?

(So, he's using this motive question as ammunition, huh? Well, I've got ammunition too... Evidence!)
Your Honor... Take a look at this.
Er, it's not. Don't lick it, please. Detective Crescend. ...Ever seen this?
What it is... is evidence. Don't lick it before you try it.
Specifically, this is a replica of a cocoon... ...It was found among the victim's belongings.
It does! ...Wait! I mean, I think it does.
...Not this one. This cocoon makes a powerful "curative".
Right! The victim, Romein LeTouse, was an Interpol agent. Detective Crescend! You insist on referring to him as a "manager"... But that is misleading! Romein LeTouse wasn't killed as a manager! He was killed as an undercover agent!
I'm saying that could well be a motive for murder.
"Unthinkable", you say? Why?
(This is the only motive I've got... He was up to something, and I'm going to find out what!)

That memo! That's how you knew about the cocoons!
You had to know about the cocoons to plan this.
Well, Lamiroir knew about them, though not their use.

So there are other Interpol agents like Mr. LeTouse?

Dangerous...?

...Why not choose a less dangerous buyer then? I would.
Why sell to a black market buyer? How about someone... like this!?
A deadly poison can be extracted from the cocoon. But so can a cure! And not a cure for just any disease... ...A cure for Incuritis!
(You went to visit a victim of the disease this morning!)
Our witness is a detective. He would have contact with the Chief Justice!
...Not even to save his own son's life?
That's Detective Crescend's insurance! If word ever got out, the one with his neck on the line... ...would be the Chief Justice!
W-Well...
...Do tell.

Just how strict is this Customs' check?
(That's right. Gavin was in Borginia, wasn't he.)
(Here's a travel tip for you, Gavin: leave the bling at home, you glimmerous fop.)


But, wouldn't scarcity drive up prices?
(...And that's a bad thing?)

...Why not choose a less dangerous buyer then? I would.
Why sell to a black market buyer? How about someone... like this!?
A deadly poison can be extracted from the cocoon. But so can a cure! And not a cure for just any disease... ...A cure for Incuritis!
(You went to visit a victim of the disease this morning!)
Our witness is a detective. He would have contact with the Chief Justice!
...Not even to save his own son's life?
That's Detective Crescend's insurance! If word ever got out, the one with his neck on the line... ...would be the Chief Justice!
W-Well...
...Do tell.

Th-That's pretty extreme.

Which is why you'd know how to find a loophole in the system!
That wasn't what I was trying to... um...
...! Why I oughta...!
(Grr! Screw cool! I want this guy's head on a stick!)

You're in a position to know quite a bit about smuggling.
(...I weep for our judicial system.)

(...The replica has to be the key to his motive... There's got to be a way to find out what he was up to!)
Actually, there is one way.
One way to get something out of the country, no checks.
...You become a prosecutor.
Believe it, Prosecutor Gavin. What was it that you told me yesterday at your office?
Did I get that right, Prosecutor Gavin? "Untouched"?
With cocoons this small, it would've been very easy... ...to use your guitar as a mule to smuggle a cocoon out of Borginia!
Which reminds me, Prosecutor Gavin. That guitar had some "work" done on it recently, right?
Exactly. Consider this, if you will. What if that igniter wasn't the only thing that was attached inside your guitar?
There was a way to get a cocoon out of the country! They could use picky Prosecutor Gavin's privileged guitar as a mule!
And who better to do that than someone with access... ...like a member of the band!
It was a safety precaution!
Every strange thing that happened that day. Care to review? Maestro, the gentle sounds of Lamiroir's ballad, if you please.
The key was stolen to retrieve the cocoon from the guitar.
But... things didn't go so well. The smuggler wasn't counting on the guitar being wrapped! Only a member of the band could get near that case. Unwrapping the guitar would raise too many suspicions. ...Then the concert began. Right about this time... ...a very large problem presented itself to the smuggler.
Mr. LeTouse.
If the cocoon were confiscated then, the gig would be up. The only thing left for the smuggler to do was to get rid of the whole lot.
The guitar burst into flames, and the cocoon... was lost. And then... Mr. LeTouse died.
There's your case.
It's not so hard to imagine. You had help. A Borginian accomplice. ...That's all.
That you had an accomplice was clear from the start! The voice Lamiroir heard proves it!
You made this transmission from backstage.
(This is it, the coup de grâce! And for once I know what I'm doing... There's only one person who could have helped him!)


...... I'd like to commend Prosecutor Gavin on his superb reasoning!
(Ouch...)

Um, actually... can I take that back?
(Ouch...)
There is only one person who meets all the requirements of the accomplice... ...and that person is the defendant, Machi Tobaye!
I assure you, no one is more unhappy about this than I. But, I am here to defend him in the murder of Mr. LeTouse. And I stand by my statement earlier that he is innocent of that particular crime.
It couldn't have been.
The reason... is electronic signals, Your Honor.
Recall that this remote only works to a range of 30 feet. Beyond that, it's useless.
Now, think back to the testimony... When the shooter made his transmission, Lamiroir was in the air vent. Right above the dressing room where the shooter stood. Let's look at the stage diagram! This is the area that the remote could reach from the air vent.
No. When the shooter made that transmission... ...the stage was slightly different than shown here. It was in the middle of "The Guitar's Serenade". Part of the stage... was raised. Prosecutor Gavin and the Lamiroir stand-in were in the air! They were on a tower which happens to be 15 feet tall! In other words! The remote couldn't have worked from Lamiroir's position in the air vent!
Well, Detective Crescend? What do you say to that?
(Wh-What? Don't tell me he has a way out of this!)
P-Punk...?
...Care to explain for us non-musicians?
Y-Yes...?
...OK...
Piano...?
Ah...!
Urk...!
Uh... Uuuuuuuuuurrrrgh! (The piano plays non-stop! He couldn't have pressed that switch...!)
W-Well...
I can't be wrong! Everything makes perfect sense! How could it all... just...
Wh-What's strange?
..."Odd"?
B-But everything points to it! Every fact says he's the accomplice!
!
I know that! It has to be him... He was the only one who could have helped the smuggler... He had to have pressed that switch!
Argh! What do I do... What do I do!?
Something odd...! Wait a second...
(What was Gavin saying just now...?)
Wh-What's strange?
(...It's not much to go on, but it's all I've got! What exactly did he hear that was "odd"?)
...I don't know if you call this "proof", per se... But... I can prove it was possible!
I... can't prove it. But... I can prove it was possible!


The basis for my claim... is this evidence, Your Honor!
(Maybe... I picked the wrong evidence.)
(Urgh... What did Gavin hear that was "odd"? That's the only hint I've got here. If Machi's hands were tied up playing the piano...)
The basis for my claim... is music, Your Honor.
Let's listen to the piano part, around the time when the switch was to be pressed... ...right before the guitar burst into flame.
But... doesn't it sound kind of simple?
He only needed one hand to press that switch! He could play the piano with the other!
Um, actually no.
Urk...! (Maybe... I don't know what I'm talking about here.) Wait! I know! Hey, Trucy!
Mr. Wright, your father, he's a pianist! Could he...
...... ...No. Not really.
That was just the easy way to prove it. There's always the hard way.
I admit, it will be rather difficult to prove. But it's highly likely he was playing with one hand.
The clue is what Prosecutor Gavin described as sounding "odd".
What sounded odd? I'll bet we can tell by listening to a certain part of the song.
(Machi was definitely playing one-handed just before the guitar caught fire! And one section of the song proves it!)


(Wait, so what was the "odd" thing that Gavin heard? The switch was pressed in the first half of the second verse, right? I know! I just need to find a place to compare to that!) Your Honor! If you'll give me one more chance, I think I can find it!
Prosecutor Gavin... I'm sure you've realized by now... ...just what it was that sounded "odd" to you.
I'll demonstrate. Let's listen to the part in question again, shall we? Pay particular attention to the "But a fleeting melody" phrase.
You're right. Enough of that!
Let's listen to another section, shall we?
The guitar burst into flame at the end of the second verse. Let's listen to the same spot... in the first verse. Pay attention to "O that night in your embrace"...!
There! Did you hear that?
Well put, Your Honor! The phrase in verse two is quite simple... But the same phrase in verse one has high and low notes! You'd have to use two hands to play that for sure!
I would think you'd know that by now.
Now ask yourselves why Machi changed how he played... and there's only one answer! He needed a free hand in order to press the switch!
(What? No comeback...? I can't believe it! I finally did it! I shut him up!)
...It's not over? (I don't like it when he looks so... so happy.)
Huh... M-Me!?
Yeah, but the facts... Anyone can see it was him!
But... But...
I don't believe it...!
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaat!? (The truth is staring us all right in the face! Why can't they see it!? What's the point of a legal system that protects criminals!?)
So what do I do!?
Ugh...
I think he just meant a weak spot, no? The kind of thing that a single spark could turn into a wildfire of emotion... (I won't be able to press him further by conventional means... I've got to find a weak spot in this guy... Something fatal...)
...Every man has an igniter.
Didn't you say "the better the guitar, the brighter it burns", Prosecutor Gavin?
Even a small spark could cause irreparable damage. Your plan has an "igniter" in it, too, Detective. ...It was there from the very beginning.
(Fightin' time, Justice. If you blow this one... ...he'll be out of your hands for good...)
...Yes, Your Honor.
(OK... This is really my last chance! The key that will take apart Daryan Crescend's plan is...)
The defense is prepared to show the court evidence!

(Ack! He's not flustered at all! I picked a dud...)
(Ow ow ow...)
(Think, Justice! Are you sure about this...?)
Your "igniter" isn't a piece of evidence.
It is true that I couldn't show decisive evidence. But perhaps what I needed to prove my case was something else.
Proving his guilt is a tall order... ...but I've got just the person to do it.


(He's... not scared at all, is he? *sigh* Wrong person.) I'm sorry... it was an honest mistake. One more try, Your Honor?
(Ugh...)
(Think, Justice! Are you sure about this...?)
The one person who can prove Daryan Crescend's guilt... ...is the defendant, Machi Tobaye!
Machi Tobaye was an accomplice to the cocoon smuggling plot. Without him, Daryan Crescend could not have gotten the cocoon. Furthermore, he can easily prove that the one who plotted to smuggle that cocoon... ...is the real criminal in this case!
It would require just one of the very cocoons Mr. LeTouse was looking for. With the cooperation of the Republic of Borginia, we could burn a cocoon. The burnt cocoon would leave a particular residue. A residue we would, no doubt, also find inside the burnt-out guitar!
Thus, if Machi Tobaye acknowledges his agreement with Daryan Crescend... ...concerning the attempted smuggling of a Borginian Cocoon... ...the case is solved!
...Why not?
But you're wrong, Detective Crescend.
It's the other way around! If Machi doesn't admit to smuggling here... He's in deep trouble!
Look, if Machi admits to smuggling here... ...then he'll be tried in our courts, by our laws. You don't get the death penalty for smuggling in our country.
The victim in this case was an undercover Interpol agent. I'm sure that news has already reached Borginia.
But, if Machi doesn't admit to smuggling now... ...he'll eventually be picked up by the Borginian police. And it's not like he's in any danger in our court. We're not going to find him guilty of murder here, not now!
Maybe the "law" doesn't allow it... But who's going to think you're really innocent after hearing this trial? ...The same goes for Machi Tobaye.
The cocoon smuggling, your entire plan... ...Machi Tobaye knows everything. There's only one way out of it for him. And that's to acknowledge his own crime! The crime of cocoon smuggling!
...I'm guessing we can treat that outburst as a confession?
There's a kind of sick desperation in it now, though.
I didn't want it to turn out this way. But... I'm not the kind of lawyer that can overlook a crime.
Machi...
Well, he did smuggle a cocoon out of Borginia. I guess there'll be another trial here...
Lamiroir...?
I'm sorry...! I... Machi was your partner on stage! Your friend...!
I'm still sorry...
An accident...?
Painting...?
Uh, thanks, Mr. Wright, but for what?
Right. Your secret mission.
(And so, like a ballad, the trial flowed on and on... until it came to the end. Thanks to the trial... ..."The Guitar's Serenade" was a huge hit. Prosecutor Gavin's even more dazzling to look at now. But... there's something I want to say to that guy. Next time you write a ballad...)

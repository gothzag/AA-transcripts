(Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.)
Huh?
Uh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?)
Begin... what?
Erm, talents?
Well... Uh... I guess... Defending?
Y-You think so...?
Huh?
Wh-What are you talking about? I can't just "defend" here!
...Thanks.
...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all.
What? Um, defend... No?
Huh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right?
Look, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge...
Mistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning!
What's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say "Wright Talent Agency"...?
(It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...)
Trucy... Wright.
Apollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law.
All these legal books must be Mr. Wright's leftovers... ...There's a lot of unrelated books in here, too. "One Trick a Day"... "Magic for Idiots"... You'd think a pro magician would aim a bit higher.
"Mister" Charley...?
Huh. (Mr. Charley... riiight.)
That's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when.
I'm not so bad with one myself, actually.
Huh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?)
A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. Um, is this one of those boxes for cutting people in half?
I've seen one on TV... But why is one just sitting here in your office?
(It's not exactly what I'd call a "welcoming" decor.)
An old, sepia-tinted photo of a man in a silk top hat.
(Sure, nice... Guess it's good to have a role model. Even if he's gotta be well over 100.)
There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano.
But you can't play the piano with all this junk on it.
(I guess Mr. Wright really can't play...)
A blue silk hat, just like the one Trucy is wearing.
(Last thought from my mind, honest.)
Whoa! That fork is floating! ...Not. Why do you have a plate of plastic spaghetti here?
Do tell.
That table... doesn't look very sturdy.
So, like, you make this teapot disappear?
Kinda hard to see the difference, I'd think...
So... Is this really a talent agency?
Two people... Does that include you?
Er... right.
Your dad, in other words. Didn't he say he couldn't play the piano?
At least you're optimistic, I'll give you that.
So you're his, er... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter?
No.
F-Fifteen? Uh, how old is Mr. Wright?
...I'm sure there's a good explanation. (I hope...)
Um, about Mr. Wright giving up law... It was because of that incident seven years ago, wasn't it...?
Not the details. I remember the news, though. It was a big deal.
Daddy, right... That reminds me. About Mr. Wright... He gave me a call this morning to come in.
The hospital!?
Wh... What!?
H-Hey! My badge! What'd you do with my badge!?
Huh! No way... My pocket? (Wait a second... There's something in there!) ... It's a flyer for your agency!
(That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.)
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
(What's up with this "Wright Talent Agency"? Guess I'll talk to her and find out what I can.)
OK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit.
Right. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK?
(So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...)
Uh, yeah. Are you the... doctor?
Wow, what an odd bird that guy was.
Mr. Wright...
(What can I say, the man loves his grape juice.)
A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. "The Steel Samurai", "The Nickel Samurai"... "The Pink Princess", "The Zappy Samurai: Electric Bugaboo"... They're all children's action hero shows...
Huh. Like a niece or nephew?
Quite the collection. This kid's parents must be really generous with their allowance. (Funny, Mr. Wright doesn't seem the type that kids would like.)
Mr. Wright's bed... It's really messy.
(Yikes! She's attempting to clean up! Look out!)
(Yeah, it might ruin your illustrious career pretending to play the piano.)
This looks like a child's toy piano.
Uh... no thanks.
What's that on TV? Looks like some sort of action hero show...
I had no idea you liked this kind of stuff, Mr. Wright.
Um... yeah. (Try not buying them.)
Your... reports?
So... what happened?
A hit and... You were hit by a car!?
You hit a telephone pole with your head!? Are you OK!?
(He really is as lucky as they say...)
There's something that, well, it just doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean.
(Ah ha ha, my foot. I'm not buying it.)
She's a magician, right? She told me.
You could just tell me things instead of insinuating them.
So, why did you contact me? What could the Wright Talent Agency possibly want with me?
Hey, I didn't ask to be dragged in like this!
Well, yeah, of course. "Help! We're in big trouble here at the office! Big!" ...I thought someone was dying.
Hey! This isn't exactly a suitable conversation to be having with a 15 year old kid!
Huh? What? Now it's my fault?
A... A client? (You mean I get to do my job? I get to defend in court!?) ...Alright. I'll hear what you have to say.
(It's official: I'm scared.)
Alright, so who's the client?
Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal.
...Huh?
Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective!
...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home.
How could you not recognize an attorney's badge!?
(I guess some seven years are longer than others.)
Huh?
The office... You mean the talent agency? (No harm in going. It's not like I have anything else to do.)
(So, he's going to make me investigate this after all...)
(This... is our client?)
Oh, uh, y-yes? (The name's "Apollo".)
Yes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you?
Don't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it!
N-Noodle...?
No nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him!
Not really...
Uh, whose noodles?
So... You run a noodle stand, Mr....
Oh. That's... not that long, really.
Oh.
(Not a mental image I care to linger on.)
Um... So tell me more about Eldoon's Noodles.
(Now I really don't want to find out.)
I'm sorry... I'll be sure to drop by your stand soon.
Eh?
Stolen...?
(That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...)
Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here.
(A tab at a noodle joint?)
Good... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request?
Speaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective...
Things have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves.
Huh? (I have a bad feeling about this.)
...Panties?
Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...
Ah, er, right. Panties.
Well, that was certainly brave of you.
Er, right.
I... I guess.
(Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list...
...Who's going to pay us for this again?
For which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles...
...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better.
Aren't you enthusiastic.
(*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.)
(Maybe I should ask her more about her... uh... This is going to be difficult--)
Yeah?
Uh, no thanks, I pass.
Well? Do we have any leads?
(Whoa! Where'd all this evidence come from?)
Um... So what happens next?
...Yeah. Neat. (*sigh*)
Whoa! No, don't! Sorry, my bad!
Huh? Mr. Wright's gone.
He'll probably be back soon. Let's wait.
(Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.)
Yeah, I guess you're right.
A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. After that trial, I'll never drink grape juice again. Clearly not a problem for Mr. Wright, however.
A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. It looks ready to collapse. Better keep my distance.
Mr. Wright's bed. Wow, what a mess. Trucy must be in charge of cleaning at home.
A small, children's piano. I guess the man likes pink.
The television's been left on... to an episode of the Steel Samurai. That's the same episode as before. Must be his favorite.
So this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car?
What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.
Um, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...)
(Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?)
Eh.
Urk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye!
B-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!)
Waaaaugh! R-Right!
(Does she know no fear!?)
I-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...)
The Kitaki Family is pretty big around these parts.
(...I'll pass, thanks.)
A brightly painted dragon. Why do I get the feeling he's glaring at me? Those paints must have been to repaint this wall.
The... third?
N-No, don't tell me. It's better that I don't know.
There's paint splashed all over this gate. (What a mess...)
(I'd laugh if my teeth weren't chattering so hard.)
Wh-Whoa!
How about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy?
I'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures.
Trucy! Through me! Please! I'm begging you here!
(...I'm going to need some warm tea after this.)
(Let's not ask about "business if we can help it, please?)
There was a car accident here last night?
Of c-course you wouldn't know about it! S-Sorry to bother you!
Y-Yes?
Um, could you avoid using too much, er, industry lingo?
Cleaning up this... paint?
Was this paint spilled at the time of the accident?
(I'm sure that dragon is glaring at me.)
Please! Go through me when you want to...
Urm, yes.
(How noble of him...)
(Public facilities...? I wonder if she means that trash can...)
Who's that!? She's looking at the park.
(There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.)
...Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate.
(That's quite the determined old lady.)
People Park... Huh, kind of an odd name for such an empty place.
Huh? Oh yeah... It says, "Donated by Big Wins Kitaki".
...Let's not get too friendly with them, shall we? (A gangster building a park...? Odd move for a crime boss.)
Personally, I'm a little more interested in this park.
Um, did something happen here, officer?
We're not kids and we're not playing! I'm an attorney!
(Detective...?)
You're hardly one to comment on how people are dressed.
Look, we're not...
Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Let's go, Trucy!
Grr... How are we going to get more information like this?
(Oh yes, that nice woman... *gulp*)
I gotta say, I'd really like to know what happened here...
(Hmm... No dice.)
There's a big trash can on the way into the park. I guess we could check it out...
I'm an attorney, actua... Huh?
These... are slippers. They look like those slippers you get at the hospital...
It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone.
I do. This could be from the car that hit Mr. Wright!
There's a side-view mirror with some paint on it in this trash can.
(Should I swap the slippers for the mirror?)
Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would.
...On second thought, let's not and say we did.
There's some paint on the slippers in this trash can.
(Should I swap the mirror for the slippers?)
Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would.
Actually... let's not and say we did.
...Can I ask you a question?
...What happened in the park across the street?
You're kidding!
So... what happened at your house?
Eh. (I got a bad feeling about this...)
N-No! Of course not! Mercy!
(It's hard to imagine Trucy's and Mrs. Kitaki's panties having much in common... I just imagined Mrs. Kitaki's panties... *gulp*)
(What have you gotten me into this time, Trucy?)
Can you tell me anything about this mirror?
(Right! That makes this a valuable clue!)
Huh? This spot here is black.
Huh? What's this weird shape here?
So the outline was left when the leaf was removed! Ack! I got paint on my hand!
Don't. There are bare wires hanging out.
Wha--!? A-Are you OK!?
...... Don't scare me like that!
(...That girl from before!)
(She's a Kitaki, too!?)
A-Anything Agency?
Why did you give her our flyer?
She's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help!
...?
So... what's this place?
Oh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already.
You're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... "Meraktis Clinic".
The thief...?
I doubt it.
Er, um, no. Not yet.
(This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...)
The "Meraktis Clinic", huh. Looks more like a casino parlor than a hospital. They must be quite profitable.
Looks like they have a special offer going on...
Chance for what!? I don't need any shots, thank you. Whoever runs this clinic, they seem pretty business-minded.
I'd understand if there was an ambulance outside... But a police car?
(Do we look like the right age to be playing doctor!?) We need a little more info on this Meraktis Clinic.
...*sigh*
So you used this plastic sheet to cover your stand at night? ...I see.
Well no, but it does suggest that the thief knew what he or she was looking for. They clearly knew what was under that sheet.
Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon?
(I always thought character was a positive thing.)
...That's quite a sign. I take it that's "NOO" as opposed to "OLD"?
(It does have a certain power of willful denial thing going for it.)
It looks like the oil drum is connected to that sink over there...
You... don't think he uses rainwater to cook his noodles and to make the broth, do you?
... (I think I'll take a rain check on eating here.)
There's a hand-written sign here... "Save the light!"
I guess the hospital clinic next door blocks the sunlight.
(That seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few extra patients...)
I'm sure the dog has a real name, Trucy.
(I'm pretty sure dogs aren't supposed to eat noodles...)
So, your stand... "Eldoon's Noodles", was it?
(I bet high blood pressure does too.) So... your stand, Eldoon's Noodles, was stolen...
(Isn't it about time he bought a new one anyway?)
Are there any more details you could give me about the stand?
(Guess he's not aiming for that late-night market.)
When did you notice it had been stolen?
(Do that many people eat noodles for breakfast!?)
Please, I'm under enough pressure here as it is.
The garage, right. You don't think the thief lives here, do you?
(Hmm... Do I detect a little animosity here?)
(If anyone's at risk of giving someone food poisoning...)
The "wrong crowd"...?
(Trucy has a thing for professionals, clearly.)
It's not a very endearing mascot, is it?
Can I help if I like red?
Seems a shame to hide it on the bottom of the bowl. ...Huh? When I touched it the paint flaked off.
After buying the cheapest paint he could find with cold professional thrift.
Are you sure?
...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying "panties" so many times?
There's something about this car...
Look... a cell phone.
Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here?
The mirror's been broken off! (Now THIS is a clue!)
(A clue? Let's see...)
Hmm. Not that I can think of.
Oh, I wasn't smiling. It was the dust in here. I thought I was going to sneeze... Ah... ah... ah... WAACHOOO!
(I know yawns are contagious, but sneezes...?)
I think I do have just the clue you've got in mind...


(Like father like daughter with the humor, apparently.)
(Thanks for the advice...)
My clue is... this!
I guess we could check it out...
It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone.
Well... looks like we've just solved a case.
...Is sitting right in front of us, yep.
Gee, thanks, Trucy.
That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago.
Apparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case!
I remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe!
Wouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in here!
W-Wait a second... Are these your...
Whaaaat!? Already!?
No, no, really, don't mention it.
... Um, what are those?
Y-You're going to put them on? N-Now!?
Whoa! Wh-Where'd that come from!?
How did that bowl get in your panties!?
Magic... panties?
...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner!
Well, that's once case closed, at least.
Oh, right.
(Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...)
This mirror fits this car door perfectly...
...Is sitting right in front of us, yep.
Still, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties.
(I'm so glad all of this makes sense in context.)
That is a mystery...
(Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...)
This car belongs to someone at the Meraktis Clinic... and it hit Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright sprained his ankle, and the car lost a side-view mirror. This car vs. Mr. Wright... Not quite the match of the century.
We do look kind of suspicious, you have to admit.
It's OK kitty-cat! She won't make you disappear in her hat!
Look, it's a folding ladder.
...A stepladder? How is that different from a regular ladder then?
...So you admit that basically it's a ladder, right?
You have to look past the form... at the essence of the thing.
(Just a human skeleton!? ...And painted gold?)
It screams something, that's for sure.
...It's kind of odd, though.
I mean, if you wanted to know the time, you could just look at the phone itself.
Th-Thanks. (Finally, some respect!)
Well, the owner of this phone doesn't think through the details, for one.
Oh... good point.
......
Uh... I was just wondering if there was, like, a switch on these...
...Huh. Mysterious.
Ack! N-No! No thanks! (Who uses magic panties in a stage show anyway...?)
Huh? What is it?
Um, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...)
No no no, I'm fine, really. Let's just put them away, shall we? Case closed.
If it were that easy we wouldn't need the police.
(Fine, fine. I'll look for your panty-snatcher...)
I had no idea they were so important to you.
You... might not want to advertise it like that.
There's a big waste basket by the park entrance.
I don't think we need to.
Just so we're clear, searching through trash isn't a hobby of mine, OK?
I found out who this mirror belongs to.
Urk! I j-just forgot! Heh!
Shhhh!
Um, yes. (Why's she so quiet all of a sudden?) ... Is something wrong?
(Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases...
(Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...)
Yes, sir! The mirror you knocked off was just the clue we needed!
(...You don't get points for knocking off a car mirror.)
(A startling display of parental concern!)
(Make that a not-so-startling display of cheapskatedness.)
(It's actually a relief to be so thoroughly ignored.)
Maybe she went to get a paint scraper?
(Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...)
Tr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now.
An impressive gate befitting the Kitaki Mansion.
No comment.
A colorful dragon turns its baleful gaze in my direction. As if to say, "Abandon all hope ye who enter here." Don't worry, Mr. Dragon. Me and hope haven't been on speaking terms for a while.
Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. It's almost all dry. This is going to be tough to clean.
It looks like that woman's still causing trouble...
(What is she, some kind of con artist?)
Apparently, this park was the gift of the Kitaki Family. The friendly "People Park", brought to you by organized crime... A very naughty part of me is tempted to write "We Kill" on the left side of the sign.
They're not letting anyone into the crime scene. The guard at the entrance is humming a song. He's got rhythm, actually. Maybe he plays in a band.
...You have an interesting concept of praise.
Apparently... it was a doctor. From the Meraktis Clinic.
That reminds me, a police car was parked outside the clinic.
What is this Meraktis Clinic anyway?
Bad...?
Um... the Kitaki Family? (He did that on purpose!)
Interesting...
Something more unusual than being dead?
(What ever happened to professional curiosity?)
Um... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing.
Eh.
(Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*)
You... You're the woman from the Kitaki place!
Your request... let me guess, something's been stolen?
Whaaaat!? You mean, you mean you want me to defend you? Me?
Fiancé...? What happened to him, then?
So, what's your story? You frequent the Kitaki Mansion, yes? Are you a member of their, um, organization?
The boss's son...? So he's a, uh... *gulp* (A gangster...)
(I'm not sure your daddy would care much for that...)
Wh-What happened!?
And your fiancé was arrested for this?
Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct?
Well. That's... quite the photo.
But, if he's the boss's only son...
(...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!)
No, no, it's me who's sorry, really! Sorry!
Oh, it's fine. (I should hope it's your first...)
Um... it's a bit of lingo. Like "call in a hit", or a "hit man"...
I certainly hope not... (Something tells me she used the wrong envelope...)
Huh...? Where's Mr. Wright?
How many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?)
What? Me? No!
L-Let's just come back later, shall we?
For a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins!
Aaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki?
So much for that battle...
That security camera is looking at me. I wonder if they tape all of this.
A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I have no idea if he's listening to us talk. I'm not even sure he's breathing.
(So this is it... My first murder crime scene!)
Sir, I have a letter of request here.
(Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...)
...! (Who's this guy...?)
Mr.... Gavin?
... Hey! What about me!?
...Who was that?
Whaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin.
Excuse me? We have a letter of request!
(Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?)
...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there?
(The body... was pulling the stand!?)
...She doesn't seem that happy about many things.
B-But we need to investigate!
...I've noticed. Well, we've solved the case of the missing stand at least. ...Though the circumstances could stand to be better.
B-But we need to investigate!
(She's not going to let us check out the crime scene, is she...)
...I think I know what you mean. It's kind of hard not to notice. (I'd better check out what we came here to find at least.)
Um, Detective Skye...?
(She must not be very busy...)
(He? Who's he? An ex-defense attorney...?)
Um, if you could spare a moment to take a look at this?
(...Eating snacks, yes.)
(This is going nowhere fast.)
Looks like he left.
Oh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry.
The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ... Hot dang, my hair looks good.
Looks like this is a banner for some campaign. "Three shots for the price of one"... Somehow I don't see people lining up for that.
A police car is parked in front of the Meraktis Clinic. It's empty. The police must be inside investigating.
The blue tarp Mr. Eldoon used to cover his noodle stand. Robbed of its purpose, it blows in the wind... alone.
A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal.
Mr. Eldoon's house has seen better days. And I'm betting I've eaten better noodles.
This must be his business sign. It reads "NOO". Maybe that's how the kids are spelling "new" these days. Another failed attempt at hipster marketing.
An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting! Something tells me this wasn't the first time.
There's a hand-written sign here... "Save the light!" It's hard to make out the sign in the shade from the clinic next door.
Guy Eldoon's dog doesn't look too lively. They say dogs and their owners resemble each other... I guess there are exceptions.
Who? Me? No! I'm fine. Really.
No, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request.
Huh...?
... The request was for me!
(He's doing that on purpose! I know it!)
It's related to the murder in People Park, actually.
...Uh, I think the murder weapon was something else.
...You know her?
So... you know her, don't you?
(That would make her about the same age as me!)
That other guy...?
He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin!
...You know him?
His brother!?
(I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?)
"White powder"...? (I hope it's not what I think it is.)
You seem to be having fun.
...Uh, I think it was the other way around. The dead man was pulling the stand. But you're right about it being mysterious.
So this must be the "silk top hat" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh?
You know what this is, Trucy?
(This is getting more and more suspicious...)
Hmm. The bottle has a label on it.
Uh, not a word. I'm not sure I speak whatever language this is written in.
Um... Does this ring any bells?
I brought it from the office.
Er, yeah, sort of...
Oh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!)
Fingerprints...?
(White powder memories...)
(Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...)
Benches line the river running through the park.
That river's a little deep for splashing... and a little dirty.
Blue tarps have been placed on the ground around the stand.
...I guess he could have eaten all the noodles he wanted.
(Oh, I guess the police put these tarps here after all.)
It's... a knife!
(Wait, but wasn't the murder weapon a pistol...?) Huh? Look at this, there's a handprint on this shiv...
...Choose a fingerprint?
(Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...)
(Right, let's give it a shot!)
Hmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print.
So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.
And I'm dimming.
(The trial hasn't even started and I'm already losing...)
A knife is sticking straight into the ground.
(I don't know what he did with it but I don't like it.)
This mannequin is dressed up to look like a police officer. I've seen one at the station. (A mannequin in place of a body...)
What, you think someone killed him because he stole it?
(Try not to sound too eager about that, please...)
...And this is Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand, obviously.
And that mark on his paper lantern there looks familiar.
Anyway, that wraps up three of our cases.
(And leaves us with one case that's worse than all three put together... Murder.)
(There's got to be a good clue or two around here...)
Please, can't you see I'm doing my... Huh? L... Look! Another pair of underwear!?
Stop saying that. Wait, these aren't...?
(Could these have been stolen, too?)
Don't you have more important things to remember? Wait, these aren't...?
(Could these have been stolen, too?)
But... why?
Well, what was the cause of death...?
(Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.)
Actually, we do know where the noodle stand came from. The noodle stand's owner is...


(You could try actually investigating, rather than just standing around.)
This is the proprietor of Eldoon's Noodles, Mr. Eldoon himself!
A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...)
(Detective Skye... Hmm.)
(Favors? Wasn't she in high school when she left?)
(If she's been out of the country for a while... ...she probably doesn't know about Mr. Wright's current, erm, "state of affairs".)
Um... Could you tell us a bit about the defendant? He's the only son of the Kitaki Family, yes...?
Why was he arrested in the first place?
Er, a-actually, yes, I am.
Eh...?
Could you tell us a bit more about the victim?
(I told the detective about the case of the stolen noodle stand.)
That would seem to be the case.
Don't ask me!
Ah! Ah, no! N-Nothing. (I... I actually felt inspired for a moment there.)
Oh yes. Breathless. (Actually, it does sound kinda interesting...)
Ugh. This doesn't look good.
(He's dead, give him a break.)
The label reads "Fingerprint Powder" in some strange language.
Why would anyone go through the trouble?
I hardly think possessing fingerprint powder is a crime.
You certainly know who they belong to at a glance.
...I would think writing your name would be easier than drawing a plum blossom.
That would mean he was here the night of the crime.
Not so neat when it happens to be evidence against our client...
Um, I think that says "Noodle". As in "Eldoon's Noodles".
Yeah... I guess it would be. Well, except for the last "s".
Uh, close, but that would be "Taem Maet" backwards. And what kind of store is that?
Ah. Uh... No.
Good idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?)
(Some traditions I can live without.)
B-But we still have three minutes!
(Not someone I care to meet...)
......
(Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?)
Y-Yes, sir!
Er... Actually, I came to speak to your son.
Yes?
Y-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear!
(I don't feel so good...)
You... must be Wocky?
(Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.)
So much for talking to our client.
Of course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?)
Huh... Mr. Wright's not here today?
Old injury...!? He was all smiles yesterday!
Yes... Fine... We'll be fine. Here comes Justice!!! I started my voice training at 5 this morning.
Huh? Oh, OK. ...Ahem. My name is Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!!!
Ack! G-Good morning!
Uh, not really.
(My worst fears realized... The trial's starting and I still haven't had a real talk with my client!)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
(...It's Mr. Gavin's brother!)
...!
(What's that... noise?)
(This is crazy...)
What do you mean, undeniable?
(Could you talk without the accompaniment?)

Not so fast! The defendant doesn't have to explain that!
(What is right!)
(It's not his guts I'm worried about...)
(I can't believe this is the first time I'm hearing about all of this...)

First of all, the word you're looking for is "quack". And isn't that a little harsh? He's your family doctor...
(Uh... your lawyer?)

By "someone" you mean...? Was there anyone with a score to settle with this doctor? ...Besides you, I mean.

So you were a patient at the Meraktis Clinic half a year ago? For what reason?
(Shot in the heart and he's still alive!?)

What do you mean, he just let you go without a word?

So, this bullet is still...?

You figured it out that day? So you had no idea until then?
Whaaaat!? You had a bullet in your chest and you didn't know!?
(How many bullets does it take!?)

You "went to his pad"...? Did you have an appointment to meet with the victim? In the park, perhaps?
(...He's right. That does seem to be the shortest path.)
(Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.)
(Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!)
Wocky! ...Please consult your lawyer before saying things like that...
The F-Family check-up?
Wh-Whaaat!?
......
I'm a little uneasy myself. (Is this Gavin's strategy...?)
Whoa! Don't point that thing to me!
...Very reasuring.
...Yes, Your Honor.
Uh... Trucy? Why are you staring like that at the witness?
...?

On the way home from shopping, you say? Why go through the park?
Th-That's enough! Enough. I get the idea.
(Gee, sorry you're all so busy!)

Were these men talking, by any chance?
(Sounds like he heard them clearly enough to me!)
(Wh... What now!?)
(What's the difference!?)

How can you be so sure it was the defendant!? The crime took place at night! It would have been too dark!
Huh?
(...Who cares!?)
He seems to be telilng the truth, too. *sigh*

Are you sure the pistol you saw is the same as the one just submitted as evidence?
...Huh?
(My badge for a normal witness...)

Are you absolutely certain only one shot was fired?
(Ah ha! A contradiction! Finally!)
Mr. Stickler. According to the Court Record, the pistol was fired twice. A clear contradiction!
Eh? Y-You really think so?
(Ugh... He's got a point.)

(He seems pretty confident in his testimony.)
(...Right! Better give that testimony another listen.)
(Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.)
Huh? Oh, er... Ahem! Objection!!!
Urk! Eh, right! Ahem, um, look at this!
Um, right, a problem... Problem... problem... Yes!!! The problem is the location of the entry wound!
You testified that the killer shot the victim "square in the forehead", did you not?
Yes?
N-N-No! I'm obsessed with something big! I mean, there's a bigger, less nitpicky problem here!
Just look at the autopsy report! The location of the entry wound was... ...the right temple!
Mr. Stickler, you said quite clearly that the victim was shot "square in the forehead"! That's a contradiction! ...Isn't it? (It is, right? Finally!)
Yes...?
...! Look, I know the wound was in the wrong place according to this testimony!
...! (F... "Forehead"!?)
Well, I... I guess... I would try to stop them. I'd probably shout, "Stop!"
Ack...! (If the victim turned his head at the last moment...*gulp*)
Th-That doesn't really matter now, unfortunately.

So you saw a raised pistol... Weren't you frightened?

Are you sure both men were able to hear your voice?

Did you hear the gunshot at the same time as the victim turned?
And the victim didn't ask you for help?
Don't say that too loud, Trucy, please...

Can you describe the killer's actions more clearly?

You didn't try to apprehend the criminal?
...! What?
According to the testimony, that's what happened, yes.
(Find "something"? Find what?)

Wait a second!
Um... come again?
Yes, Your Honor?
Yes! I mean, no! Here, just look at the pistol! It doesn't have a single fingerprint on it!
Wait! But you said the killer tossed the gun and ran!
(Could the killer have been wearing gloves...?)
(If he was wearing gloves, there wouldn't be prints...) ... (C'mon Justice, you've gotta come up with something...!)
I g-guess he could have been wearing gloves. (...I guess.)
Not as sad as I feel. What do we do now?
(She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.)
The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing: The fingerprints were "wiped" which means some trace of prints remained! Which contradicts your testimony! If everything happened as you say it did, he wouldn't have had time to wipe the pistol!
...
You know, I've only recently realized something. No matter how much you train your voice, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to say.
Huh? Isn't what obvious?
You're right!
Then it had to be something else!
(Grr... I'll wipe that smile off your pretty face, Gavin!)


What the witness really saw... was this! Or... something like it.
(That didn't even warrant a wise-crack, did it.)
(Great, a sleep-deprived judge...) This knife was found at the scene of the crime... with the defendant's prints on it.
This single piece of evidence proves two important things: One, that what the defendant threw down wasn't a pistol. Two, that the defendant wasn't wearing gloves!
Huh?
Oh.
(Grr... Never underestimate a Gavin is the lesson here.)
Why didn't you chase the killer?
(I'd better find a way to take this testimony down quick!)

Which way did the killer run?
(That would mean he ran in the opposite direction from the Kitaki mansion...)
(Ugh... How did he know that's where I was going...?)

You were certainly composed for someone who had just witnessed a killing.
(Hmm... So nothing strange about how he acted...)
(Trucy looks like she has something to say...)

Wasn't your first thought to call an ambulance?
(...He actually looks like he's going to cry.)

Can you tell us in detail about these 10 minutes?
Is... that all?
(So he just stood there, watching? Hmm... Not much to go on there.)
(... Trucy, if you've got something to say, by all means, say it!)
(This witness is way too self-assured! There's got to be a weakness somewhere in this testimony!)
(Argh! I can't find a single problem with that testimony!)
(Maybe it's time to back off a bit...?)
The defense still has some questions that demand answers, Your Honor!
(Maybe there isn't anything left to unravel in this testimony after all...)
(...They don't have enough to put Wocky away yet. Should I back off for now?)
Nnk...! (Argh! There's nothing fishy about that testimony at all!)
No... Nooooooooooo!
(No... that can't be all!)
T-Trucy!?
Wait... Are you... one of the Kitakis!?
W-Wait! (How'd he disappear so fast!?)
Trucy! Trucy!?
T... Trucy! You're OK! I-I thought... *sniff* *sob* *bawl*
Grr... Those good-for-nothing gangsters! There are some things you just don't do! I'm pressing charges!
Aaaaaugh! Wh-Wh-What the heck is that!?
...
You mean you... Trucy! There are some thigns you just don't do! I... I'm pressing charges!
Huh...?
B-But that testimony was rock solid! What are you suggesting I do?
Trucy, no more staged abductions, please...
You can see... what he's "feeling"?
All the times there was a contradiction...?
Well, I think I remember them, sure...
Um... Actually, I don't remember them exactly.
Well, that's true, but how does that help us?
How'm I supposed to see that!?
Wha--!?
You mean that's how Mr. Wright won all those games?
Great, so he cheated. But what does that do for us? (I don't believe this...)
"Watch" a testimony? "Perceive" the truth? The only thing I'm perceiving is that I'm going to lose.
...!
Mr. Wright said that? (Watch the testimony... Perceive his true feelings... Is she serious!?)
(What was that she said before the trial started?)
Huh... Mr. Wright's not here today?
(Is this what he meant by us being "fine"...? Well... methods aside, she did avoid one guilty verdict already today. Time to show this court what I'm made of! Get ready for Justice!) ...Let's do it.
You know, I'm starting to think I can do this.
?
Right... (*sigh*)
Right! We're fine!
Ah! Right! Him! Don't worry about him. I settled that.
Erm, yes, it was an... out of court settlement! Right.
I wish he would stop being so... so cool.
R-Right... The defense would like to request another cross-examination! B-Because... Because I forgot to ask something.
...Understood, Your Honor.
(I'm not sure I'm qualified to "watch" testimonies after all...)
(Focus... If only it were that easy! My ears hear what he says, my eyes see his expression. Do I have to do something more? What other senses do I have!?)
(W-What's this...? My bracelet...?)
(What's going on? My bracelet feels different somehow...!)
(I know this sounds crazy... But my bracelet is trying to tell me something!)

Which way did the killer run?
(That would mean he ran in the opposite direction from the Kitaki mansion...)
(Ugh... How did he know that's where I was going...?)

You were certainly composed for someone who had just witnessed a killing.
(Hmm... So nothing strange about how he acted...)


Can you tell us in detail about these 10 minutes?
Is... that all?
(So he just stood there, watching? Hmm... Not much to go on there.)
(I'm not sure I entirely understand this just yet. But I have "perceived" one thing... My bracelet is reacting to his testimony... this has to be the key!)
So, you called immediately after witnessing the murder?
Wait, you mean his habit?
(The only time he even had the book open was here... Which means this is the place to look for this "habit"!) I... don't know how I know, but I know.
It's my bracelet, it's different, somehow. I can feel it reacting to something about the witness!
I'm not sure I get this "focus" stuff you were talking about, Trucy. But... I have a feeling that trusting my bracelet is the way to go. (OK, I just need to touch my bracelet as it reacts to the testimony...)
Wh-What's going on!? (I can see the witness's face, his expression so clearly! I-It's filling my mind! I can see nothing else, hear nothing else!)
Trucy! What's happening to me!?
Focusing...
Th-That's great, but this is kind of freaking me out!
Sure! When he says something he's not sure of, he fiddles with a page of his book.
(I'll bet they are.)
His hand...?
(She's right. I can only see his face like this... Time to try changing my viewpoint!)
Ready... for what?
Perceive...
Right... You mean when he fiddles with the page!
Spoken like a true poker head's daughter.
(So I have to pay attention to his words... and his fingers!)
(Right! Look out nervous twitch, here comes Justice!)


Huh? Oh... I guess I'm kind of lost here.
(OK, so I have to watch for his fingers to move. Got it.)
............ (I... I saw it! Just now... I could see it!)
Mr. Stickler... Allow me to ask you a simple question. Why did you fiddle with the page of your book just now? ...The very moment you mentioned your cell phone!?
I'm curious now about this cell phone of yours... Mind if I ask a few questions? (Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...)
Mr. Stickler... Tell me your phone number!
Trucy... Do you have your cell phone?
Try dialing the number that he gives us.
Look... a cell phone.
Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here?
How strange, Mr. Stickler.
Can you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my assistant's hand!?
Mr. Stickler, please show me your cell phone!
Show me, and you'll find out.
...Mr. Stickler. Is this your cell phone?
Look... a cell phone.
Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here?
How strange, Mr. Stickler.
Can you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my hand at this very moment?
I was wondering... Can you tell me what model of cell phone you own?
Who would have guessed I'd get chewed out for asking a simple question...?
This cell phone was found yesterday... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage!
Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court, didn't you? If your cell phone is here, how could you have called the police!?
Just where was this pay phone located, Mr. Stickler!?
There can be only one reason. He didn't want the court to know he had lost his cell phone. Because it was found... ...in the victim's garage!
Mr. Stickler... You broke into the Meraktis Clinic garage on the night of the murder! This cell phone tells all!
Oh, he's already connected enough. I just have to prove it. (Well... Do I have a piece of evidence that can do the job? Can I prove the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder?)
Of course I have evidence!
(Evidence... If only I had some evidence, it'd make this whole thing a lot easier.)
(Ack! I guess this is it, then. Time to go for broke!)
The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:


(That's right! The cell phone would have been crushed!) Your Honor! One more chance, please!
As it so happens... Dr. Meraktis's car was in an accident... ...that took place the night of the murder!
An accident. It happened a little after 9 PM, just outside People Park... our murder scene. Dr. Meraktis's car hit a pedestrian!
From the absence of a mirror, it's clear that the car was parked after the accident. Which means it was parked there after 9 PM on the night of the murder. If your cell phone had been dropped before the car was parked in that garage... ...then it would have been crushed. After all, it was lying on the ground, right under the wheel!
Ergo, Mr. Stickler! The only time you could have dropped this in that garage... ...was after 9 PM the night of the murder in the park!
Mr. Stickler! You know what this means? You did break into the victim's garage that night.
(I know that face... That's the face of guilt!)
(That's funny... My bracelet didn't react at all during that testimony.)
(Right, no problem... I hope. Here comes Justice!)

So you went shopping. Which means... ...you were holding a grocery bag when you witnessed the murder taking place?

That's when you passed in front of the Meraktis Clinic?
Mr. Stickler, do you think you could be a bit more specific? Please show us the exact route you took on the night of the murder.

Which entrance did you enter the park from?
Did you notice anything when you entered? Wheel marks from a noodle stand, for instance?

(This part of the testimony is the key. I know it! Should I press him about the killer, the victim, or the noodle stand?)
Are you sure you remember the killer clearly?
(I guess the victim's identity is already old territory... Time to ask something new.)
You could see the victim quite clearly, too?
I see. So... Um... How'd he look?
Um, I mean, in general.
Y-Yes, Your Honor. (Great, a judge who moonlights as a self-help guru...)
Do you happen to remember the noodle stand?
(Hmm... What about that sign? Could that be important?)
(How could the sign matter at all? We know it's a noodle stand!)
So the sign on the noodle stand said "NOODLE"...? It appears the defense has just obtained a vital piece of testimony!
(I wouldn't mind a taste of that myself...)

Mr. Stickler, you've proven to be a most skilled witness.
I thank you for your powers of recollection. Your testimony just now was quite vital.
(If my gut feeling here is right... I've just stumbled across a major contradiction!)

So the sign said "NOODLE"? You're absolutely sure?
(He was wasting time looking that stuff up!?)
(It tells me a lot more than that, actually!)


Are you absolutely sure it was the defendant?
Nothing a good student like you has to worry about. (Time to find his weak spot and press it till he breaks!)
(Hmm... I was kind of relying on my bracelet to get me through this one...)
That gleam in your eyes... You're a gambler's daughter through and through.
And you're absolutely sure the sign read "NOODLE"?
I see...
Let's take a look at our map, shall we? So, you're claiming that when you saw the sign, you were standing... Here, was it? ...Although, it would've been a bit hard to read the sign from this spot.
Mr. Stickler. I'd like you to please take another look at the stand. ...and to carefully read what the sign says. See? That sign actually states the name of the stand's owner. ..."ELDOON'S".
I wouldn't be so quick to jump to that conclusion. (The sign he saw changes everything!) The witness says the sign said "NOODLE"...
The answer is quite simple. The witness saw the sign wrong.
Eh...?
(What if Mr. Stickler is right to be so confident...? And if he is right about the sign... what does that mean for the entire case!?)
What would you say if I told you... ...that there is one spot from which the sign would be read the way Mr. Stickler claims?
The witness actually viewed the stand from this location!


... Oh.
Urk.. Sorry, Your Honor... Mind if I try again?

... Ja.
Sorry, Your Honor... One more time, please...

...... Um... I picked the wrong place.
Sorry, Your Honor... Do I get another chance?
The witness was standing... Here! On the opposite side!
When viewed from the south... ...the sign on the stand reads "ELDOON'S", as we know. ...However! Observe the other side of the stand!
Exactly! The name of the stand is split between the front and back signs! Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court! You witnessed the crime from the northern side of the park, not the south!
S-So what!?
(...Actually, maybe he's right. What does it change?)
Trucy?
Right... But if Mr. Stickler was standing on the north side of the park... ...that reverses the whole scenario!
(Wow... The apple didn't fall far from the tree! She's flipped this whole case on its head while I was still figuring it out!)
What now?
...! (Well, I can't say he exactly looks innocent... But... something still doesn't feel right. I just can't picture him as the real killer!)
(What are you going to do now, Justice!? Should I really accuse Mr. Stickler!?)
I accuse Mr. Stickler of murder!
Y-Yes. Yes!
... Um, maybe I'd better think this over some more.
...No accusations, Your Honor.
Ack! You think? Uh, w-wait, Your Honor! Let me rethink that...
(...I don't think Wesley Stickler is a killer. But he's not innocent, either! His unusual silence tells me that much...) ...Mr. Stickler! You seem unusually quiet... Tell us why, now!
(Gah! I know he's guilty of something... but what crime other than murder is there? Do I have evidence that shows his involvement in some other crime...?)


(Something tells me this isn't one of those good silences.)
Um... One more chance? Please?
The evidence... is this!
On the night of the murder, just past 9 PM... A young girl catches a panty-snatcher red-handed! Bravely, she gives chase, but the snatcher flees... ...and hides himself in no other place than the Meraktis Clinic garage!
Incidentally... ...these panties were found in the exhaust pipe of the car there. Presumably, he was trying to hide the evidence of his crime. Ergo! While you may not be a murderer... ...you are guilty of panty-snatching in the first degree!

C'mon! You're talking about a girl's panties here!
A... tire?
Huh...?
A broom... and a frozen chicken, Trucy? What ever happened to doves and bunny rabbits?
...Me!?
...!


As do I! But I'm sure it does! Somehow! Somewhere!
(Somebody help...)
The evidence that shows why he lied... is this.
These are the last!! Honest!! These were found in a trash can at the park. Looking at the diagram... ...we can see that the trash can was right next to where the witness stood.
...Believe me, I'd rather not.
(Apparently he didn't know those bloomers belonged to the mob...)
The murder of Dr. Meraktis.
That's when you disposed of the bloomers?
...No problem!
...What a train wreck that was. I'm glad we made it out of that trial alive.
...Everyone was too obsessed with panties to bother with the real case.
Yeah...
That's about enough of him.
Oh, right! No problem!
(Well, he's not guilty... yet.)
Oh, congratulations! (Gah, way to put the pressure on a guy...)
Some magic books are mixed in with the law books here. The magic books all look well-used, but the law books are just gathering dust. ...I feel kinda sorry for them. Maybe I'll read some next time I'm around.
It's Charley, the houseplant. They've had it for years, apparently.
...Right, sorry.
(She's saying something to the plant as she waters it...)
...Is there anything else I might do to please His High Leafiness?
A giant hoop used to levitate people. So, tell me, how does it work?
Hey, I object to being placed in the same category as that panty-snatcher.
Those boxes frighten me.
(She does seem to be putting them to good use...) But, if you ever want to put it back together, you have to take everything off.
Th-Thanks, but I'll pass.
An old, sepia-tone photograph of a man in a silk hat. His outfit looks a lot like Trucy's, come to think of it.
(Trucy is big on appearances, I've found...)
There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano. It seems a shame to have all these props and not do a trick or two.
...Please, make it stop.
Any other trick but that one, please...
A blue silk top hat, just like the one Trucy's wearing.
I don't think you can trademark the color blue.
You make me sound like some second-rate superhero.
A dish of plastic spaghetti like some restaurants put on display. Where did you get this, anyway?
(Mental note: What she really wants for her next birthday: A bowl of plastic food...)
A hot water pot sits on a magic table. Why is the stand for this table so flimsy looking?
...I was hoping for a more professional explanation.
... Not bad.
Are you sure about marrying into the Kitaki Family...?
So it doesn't bother you that you'll be, erm... ...Married to the mob?
(Good question... Ms. Tiala doesn't look like the type to have gangster connections...)
(She's not very forthcoming with information about herself, is she?)
R-Really? (Mr. Kitaki wants to quit being a gangster!?)
(Hmm. I wonder if this explains that apron?) ...I can't imagine Wocky going along with that.
Um, that's not the word I would have used.
(That's not the way I would have put it...)
(Again, not the way I would have put it...)
Usually, it's the father worried about tradition...
Can I ask you a question about Wocky? I understand he was operated on by the victim, Dr. Meraktis.
I'm not sure it qualifies as "fighting" when pistols are involved.
(I'd like to know a little more about this "operation". Maybe it's time to pay the Meraktis Clinic a visit.)
R-R-Right! L-L-L-Leave it to me!
Sorry! I'm new at this, OK?
A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. Me? I haven't been able to touch the stuff since that first case. ...Not a problem for Mr. Wright, apparently.
A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. Better stay away or it'll become a crashing cascading cavalcade of DVD cases.
Mr. Wright's bed. My, it's messy. Trucy must clean up after him at home.
A toy piano, one that might be played by a child. Correction: A pink toy piano. I guess the man likes pink. Nothing wrong with that.
The TV's been left on. Hmm... Looks like the Steel Samurai's in a spot of trouble. I'm sure he'll come back to win in the end. Mr. Wright likes those kind of stories.
Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. Most of it's pretty much dry, too. This is going to be one heck of a cleanup job.
Looks like the old lady's at it again...
(...The con artist strikes again...)
The park crime scene is off limits to the public. The police officer on guard by the gate is yawning. Ah, he noticed me staring and snapped his mouth shut. Too late, Mr. Officer! I saw you!
Come to think of it, wasn't there something else in here? Something near the bottom... ...Look at the paint on these. That means... ...these must have ended up in here after Mr. Wright's accident. Maybe they're connected? Let's pick them up.
A large trash can sits by the entrance to the park.
No. What? I'm serious! I have no intention of looking through this trash can!
I think that whatever you think about me and trash cans, you're wrong.
I wonder... Could this be a print?
I bet we can analyze it just like a regular print.
Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?
What was next? We have to match the print, right?
Oh, good point.
I guess so... (I'm not sure she really qualifies as an expert...)
So, we have a toe print now.
(Maybe our detective friend can help us...)
Blue plastic tarps cover the ground around the stand. They were apparently put here to preserve the crime scene.
A knife is sticking straight into the ground. Remember what Wesley Stickler said in the trial today... Wocky was very likely pointing this at the victim.
(Yeah, that's the problem.)
A mannequin put in place of the body. I think I've seen him by the police station. The way he's forced to look at the ground now, day in and day out... It's kind of sad.
Poor Mr. Eldoon. His stand's been standing here since this whole thing started.
I think its owner would disagree.
A trash can sits next to the path here.
That's right, Trucy. And what a web of lies grew from that one little act.
...Here's what I want you to do, Trucy. Take that memory, gently lock it away deep in your heart, and never speak of it.
The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ...Wait. My hairdo's a little flat. ...There. Perfect.
A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal. You'd think he would have picked it up by now.
An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A flock of crows just flew over and... That's gross! Their aim was uncanny... almost as if they'd been practicing here a long time.
This is where we found your panties, isn't it, Trucy?
Well, thank you for saying thank you!
...Typical.
I really need to talk to him. I guess we'll come back later.
Yes?
...Wesley Stickler. (So they arrested him, too?) Alright. Let's have a little chat with Mr. Stickler. (I hope I don't regret this.)
(He is a bit "precious", I'll give him that.)
...Mr. Stickler. We'd like to have a few words with you.
(Nothing would make me happier, believe me.)
Mr. Stickler. On the night of the murder, you stole...
...How, exactly?
I dunno, I think he'd make a great "lovely assistant".
Could you relate what you saw the night of the murder to us one more time?
And this is all true? Really?
(I can't think of anything he'd want to hide more than panty-snatching, true.)
How I wish it weren't so.
(He's serious, isn't he.)
... (...Fine, ignore my evidence. See if I care. I wonder what he's thinki... On second thought, let's not go there.)
He was at the scene of the crime, that's pretty clear. (There's got to be a different angle on this...)
So? Any leads?
(Whoa! Evidence keeps flying out of nowhere!)
...Yeah, real neat. (*sigh*)
(They were the star player of the day, that's true.)
(If only I could count on panties to save the day every day...)
(Yipes! She's back!)
U-Uh, us?
(I think all this gangsterese is a negative influence on Trucy...)
W-Well, I was j-just doing...
Uh, y-yes! Sorry! I caught him!
...I'll deal with you later.
W-Wocky? Er, well, he's, um...
Y-Yes, ma'am! (This is why I was kind of hoping we could avoid coming back here.)
What? Don't look at me like that!
Yes... We heard the story from Wocky.
(Her words do have a certain weight to them...)
They didn't seem to be on the best terms, did they?
We kind of figured, given the difficulty of obtaining a gun these days.
I see...
(She doesn't seem too concerned, at least.)
They're getting married next month, correct?
(Even I could tell that!) Could you tell us more about her?
(Hmm. I wonder what the problem is?)
But Wocky seems, well... It seems like he's against his father's position.
I see... (Hmm, something must be up.)
This is the mirror we found...
Um, about these...
Um, I thought you might like them back, so...
Oh no, I couldn't, really! Thanks for the offer bu--
Great, now your props are going from bland to dangerous.
Can you tell me if this knife belongs to Wocky?
(Wow, that's a pretty hardcore present.)
So this pistol belongs to the Kitaki Family... Is that correct?
Oh?
Ah... I see.
"He"...?
(Remind me never to eat his noodles when he's in a bad mood...)
Yeah, but what about the guard?
(That's the same officer that was standing out by the park yesterday!)
(No harm in asking... No gain either. No point in sticking around here, I guess.)
(Watch what you say or it might become true...)
Mr. Eldoon, I don't mean to pry... ...but what exactly did you do before you became a chef?
(I'm starting to get an idea of what he did, anyway.)
Mr. Eldoon, if I might ask... What exactly happened between you and the Meraktis Clinic?
I couldn't help but sense enmity there...
Excuse me?
You mean... the Kitaki Family?
A deal...?
(I think I've figured out Mr. Eldoon's former occupation...)
Mr. Eldoon... or should I say "Dr. Eldoon"...
Um, yeah, kind of.
So... you weren't exactly friends.
...I see.
Well, Trucy, looks like we found ourselves a new suspect.
No, it's fine.
Huh?
Yes...?
(Hmm. I guess the time spent listening to him complain wasn't entirely wasted.)
(I guess...)
(I think I'll avoid talking about his stand in the future.)
Um... I was hoping to meet with my client?
Worried about your, um, heart condition, maybe?
(Lawyer, not gopher...)
So, I hear you're to be married next month?
(I think he's smitten with her in his own weird way.)
(Hmm, so both of them are mum about their past...)
So, you were taken to the Meraktis Clinic then?
(I'd hate to have been in that doctor's shoes... Mr. Kitaki's scary enough when he's not angry...)
(And it's still threatening his life!)
(I need to hear more about the night of the murder, that much is clear.)
(*sigh*...)
I don't think that's what "O.G." means, Trucy.
Um... Actually, there's a question I've been wanting to ask you for a while now. That is, uh... Did you do it? Did you shoot him?
Eh?
(Uh oh... I don't like where this is going...)
You don't remember...?
About these weapons... the pistol and the knife.
So, the "killer" Mr. Stickler says he saw that night was...
Gak...! (We're finished...)
(He seems preoccupied... I'm not sure he even looked at my evidence...)
Probably people trying to get a glimpse of the crime scene.
(Wait, that motorcycle...)
...Prosecutor Gavin.
Thus the screams...
(This is surreal...)
Your hog...?
...I ride a bicycle, actually.
The detective... You mean, the one in the lab coat?
And the forecast for the park today... Gloomy Skyes.
Huh? Does something about this scene look different to you?
Yeah, I think you're right. Look over there.
She's... under a lot of stress. The investigation's probably not going so well.
Oh, Detective Skye. Hello.
More to the point, doesn't she mean "glamorous"?
(Speaking of distracting...)
(Sounds like she's trying out some sort of new forensics technique...)
The tarps that were here yesterday are gone.
Yeah... The only thing they were covering is the ground.
A... "print"?
Detective Skye, you know Mr. Wright, correct?
(Wasn't she saying something about "getting involved in an incident"?)
But... you're a detective now?
(Are you sure that's OK...?)
"Glamorous"... right.
...No, actually, I don't.
Whaaaaaa--!? Really!? (He was the one!?)
(I'm neither a "boy" nor one of his... but let's see what she has to say.) Um... What exactly happened seven years ago? I never actually heard the details.
...Do you mind me asking exactly what it is you've been doing... ...squatting down on the ground like that?
(You splurged... You mean, it wasn't police issue?)
Footprint...?
...What?
Huh? Are you sure? I mean, we're sort of on opposing teams and all...
(Footprint analysis, huh? Well, should I give it a go?)
I think I'll pass. Wouldn't want to waste a kit if I messed up.
(I guess I can always talk to her again if I change my mind...)
OK... I'll give it a go!
(Why does this not fill me with confidence?)
How am I supposed to do that!?
(Hmm, that doesn't look too hard...)
Hey, give me a break! I'm just a beginner at this!
(Plaster, here comes Justice! *sigh*)
(What's that supposed to mean?)
So the shoe prints belong to Wocky Kitaki after all...
(She's definitely waaaay more into this than I am...)
(Well, that certainly brightened her mood.)
Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another go?
So these shoe prints belong to Wesley Stickler. This confirms his testimony. The final version of it, at least.
Except for the part with the leaf.
(Hmm... A mystery print.)
Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another shot?
Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another shot?
Uh, I don't think analyzing my footprint is going to do us much good.
...Yes?
(This mystery shoe print does remind me of something...)
Hmm... No, sorry. No idea.
(I'm pretty sure I've seen something that would leave a print like that.) You know, I think I have our culprit right here...


Um... Snacks?
...I had no idea.
(...I had no idea.)
Well, I think it's these slippers, actually.
But look at the bottom! See?
See, right here?
What if a leaf was stuck on the bottom, and came off when the slipper stepped in paint? ...Makes sense, doesn't it?
Exactly! The victim's clinic!
(Why is she just standing there eating?)
Can you get us access into the Meraktis Clinic?
Eh? Really?
(Right! Meraktis Clinic, here comes Justice!)
...I guess you could put it that way.
Wh-What?
A toe mark... You think we can get a print off that!?
(This little clue might be a gold mine!)
(...I guess that would be too much to hope for.)
Isn't she a little old for cute?
...R-Really now. I suppose. I've never heard it put quite that way before.
It's a little confusing. Won't people think your middle name is diamond?
I do like justice, but that's taking it a bit far.
(What did Detective Skye say? If you want to know something, you have to investigate it yourself...) Mr. Wright! Tell me what happened seven years ago... please. I want to know. I need to know!
...It was all over the news, I remember that. You were up against Prosecutor Gavin, weren't you?
(17 years old...? That's still high school!)
That's all...? How could that be all!?
What about what they were saying on the news about forged evidence!?
They said you forged evidence and had your attorney's badge stripped from you!
H-How does it feel...? (I... I don't want to believe it's true! But what about what happened in my first trial...)
B-But...!
(Mr. Wright... Looks like he doesn't want to talk about the accusations of forgery... for now.)
Yes! Thanks to you ripping the mirror off the car, I was able to deduce the...
(...Think what you want, Mr. Wright. Knock yourself out.)
And we found these, too! They're Trucy's.
(Ack! That'll teach me to show off my evidence to Mr. Wright...)
Mr. Stickler and Wocky? Both of them? (I pity the questioner...)
(Now he's suspicious again...)
This place has a connection to the murder in the park... I'm sure of it!
Beyond it being where the victim lived. (Looks like the police team's gone home for the day.)
They're from Eldoon's Noodles! There's Mr. Salty!
I think we have.
... (Not exactly what I was thinking.)
I think we've found our first clue, Trucy.
A plate on this door reads "Doctor's Office".
If we'd gone in there one second earlier, we might have met the burglar!
... It does lack a certain punch.
The clinic's reception desk. No one's here, of course. There's a small sign on the counter... "Please pay your bill: Remember, we're the ones holding the scalpel." Brutal... but effective.
Wait, but why would there be sandals here? Unless they belong to one of the patients.
You'd think they'd use his house entrance instead of the clinic entrance, in that case. And, if this patient or visitor isn't still here...
(Better take a closer look at these, just in case.)
A pair of sandals in a deserted clinic...
Hmm... Maybe her operation here was to add wings, and she flew home?
(Surgical enhancements are for a different part of the body, and, I was kidding...)
The same as the pair we found, of course.
Right... The paint's from the hit and run, after all. (But what were a pair of clinic slippers doing in that trash can? And what were they doing at the scene of the hit and run?)
Huh... This could be a toe print.
Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?
Oh, good point. If there is, Detective Skye didn't give it to us. Which means... we can't match this print.
Yeah, good idea.
So, we have a toe print now.
(Maybe our detective friend can help us...)
Think this is the victim's private office?
Why "too bad"?
...That's probably not a hobby you want to tell too many people about.
(...Someone's in there!) L-Let's check it out, Trucy!
A break-in! They left through that window!
(That must be her experience as a panty-snatcher chaser talking.) Well, we should tell the police!
Y-You're right. (She's better at this than I am!)
Whoa! What are those? The wall is covered with beakers...
H-Hey, look yourself! You can't... Oh. ...It's a goldfish.
(Whoever designed this had a sick sense of humor...)
Broken? Don't you mean burned-out?
But why is it standing up on the floor like that then?
(Huh? There's a red splotch on a part of the cord...) You think that's... blood?
Something's definitely odd about this lamp, that's for sure.
Kind of an expensive-looking lamp. The bulb's broken. (And here I thought light bulbs were usually pretty resilient little buggers.)
Funny that it's standing upright on the floor then.
The window is ajar.
I wonder who it was?
Yeah, but there's a patrol car sitting out front. If I were a burglar, I'd come back the next day at least.
(Whoever broke in obviously needed to break in today.)
Books and papers are scattered around the room.
Even the cup on the desk here is lying on its side. Huh? The juice that spilled out of that cup... It's dry.
Someone knocked this cup over a while ago and left it.
This potted plant has seen better days. Hmm... That doesn't make sense either.
Normally, burglars are looking for valuables, right?
So why look under a potted plant?
I've heard of people putting their house keys under plants, but the key to a safe...?
(This is getting nowhere fast...)
Hmm, looks like a four-digit lock.
...That burglar just now was trying to open it!? (I wonder what's inside this safe...?)
Well, we know the first two are 7 and 9...
(Hmm, I wonder...)
That would be a bit too lucky, don't you think?
(Something that could "finger which buttons were pressed", huh? Maybe there is a way after all...)
Well, I have an idea...
(Well... All we have to know is what buttons have been pressed!) We can use this to find out what the next two numbers are!


(Neither am I, come to think of it...)
(Something that could "finger" which buttons were pressed", huh?)
...When you press the buttons, you'd have to touch them... ...with your finger, right?
When you open a safe, you don't press any other buttons but the right ones, right? So, if we can find the buttons with fingerprints...
Look! You can see the oily finger residues clearly. Look at 7 and 9...
Well, we might not be able to identify the burglar, but we can open this safe! Let's give it a shot!
...It opened!
This looks like a bullet hole!
Why is it in the middle of a safe?
Not surprising given that it was fired into a metal safe. (This bullet's got a story behind it, that's for sure.)
(A bullet hole remains in the back wall of the safe. Now why would someone shoot a bullet into a safe?)
An X-ray...? Hmm, can't make heads or tails of it. And I can't read the chart either, it's all in medical-speak.
Why would this one chart be here in this safe...? Let's see, the physician's signature says "Pal Meraktis". Eh...
Look here where it says who filed the chart...
Alita Tialita is Wocky's fiancée!
Never mind that, what's her name doing here!?
Odd that she neglected to mention this before now...
(So Alita Tiala worked at the Meraktis Clinic... And she had access to Wocki Kitaky's medical chart!)
I'd be very interested to find out what this chart says. (Who could help us decipher this...?)
(Wocky's medical chart was hidden inside a safe... And Alita Tiala was the one who filed it.) We have to figure out what this chart says. (I wonder if there's anyone who can help us decipher it?)
The bulb is broken. It won't turn on.
Don't touch that. You'll cut yourself.
Yeah, yeah, fool me once, shame on me, fool my twice...
Ack! Y-You're bleeding! Let me see that... ......Wait.
...Please don't do that again. I have enough to worry about without my co-workers injuring themselves on the evidence.
This cord runs to the lamp. It has a red stain on it. Hmm... Gotta wonder what left that stain.
Why would anyone write their name on a lamp cord?
That was one tough safe.
...Huh?
You certainly have an active imagination, Trucy.
(Next she'll have us analyzing face prints...)
Say, could you take a look at this lamp?
Right. Strange, isn't it?
(Ouch...)
Ack, Trucy! Wait!
That's vital evidence there. You can't show her that! That's our secret weapon in tomorrow's trial for sure!
Ack, Trucy! Wait!
This bullet was inside the safe, right? That means the police don't know about it yet!
There is!? What?
Oh, right. So if the prints matched, you'd know the same person wore both. (Hmm. Do I have another shoe worn by the same person?)
No... I can't think of anything I might have with a toe print on it.
(A toe print sample... Hmm.)
I think I just might, actually.
(I'm beginning to suspect something here...) Detective Skye! Can you compare this sample with this other print?

What's with the scowl?
Huh? Oh, right.
(I'd better stop messing up or I'm gonna get struck down by lightning from the Skye.)
(Hmm, another toe print. Right!)


(Oops. Stormy Skyes ahead...)
(Hmm, a toe print. Right!)
This pair of sandals, toe print and all.
Can you analyze it for us?
(Hey, we were the ones who found the prints...)
I was afraid of that...
I... can't say. Not yet. (Well, that's one big step closer... ...to the truth!)
Did you find something?
A toe mark... You mean a toe print?
(This little clue might be a real windfall!)
(...I guess that would be too much to hope for.)
There is!? What?
Oh, right. So if the prints matched, you'd know the same person wore both. (Hmm. Do I have another shoe worn by the same person?)
No... I can't think of anything I might have with a toe print on it.
(A toe print sample... Hmm.)
I think I just might, actually.
(I'm beginning to suspect something here...) Detective Skye! Can you compare this sample with this other print?


What's with the scowl?
Huh? Oh, right.
(I'd better stop messing up or I'm gonna get struck down by lightning from the Skye.)
(Hmm, another toe print. Right!)

(Oops. Stormy Skyes ahead...)
(Hmm, a toe print. Right!)
This pair of slippers, toe print and all.
Can you analyze it for us?
(Hey, we were the ones who found the prints...)
I was afraid of that...
I... can't say. Not yet. (Well, that's one big step closer... ...to the truth!)
(I don't know about science, but this is a major lead!)
The toe prints match... Which means the sandals and the slippers were worn by the same person. And the slippers are from the Merakits Clinic. THese have to be connected to the crime!
The toe prints match... Which means the sandals and the slippers were worn by the same person. If only we knew who these sandals belonged to...
Do you always have to announce your entrances like that?
(One can only assume that his father tried to teach him a lesson. And failed, clearly.)
(Some days, I wonder why I do what I do.)
(If I've learned one thing today... it's that "silence" speaks louder than words.)
(*sigh*)
(Please don't talk as though it's assumed you're going to jail... for my sake.)
You mean Alita Tiala?
Right...
So... that was the proposal?
Um, about that "op"...
Incidentally... had you ever had a health check-up before?
Wocky... You don't happen to recognize these, do you?
Yeah... I kinda had a feeling.
(*sigh*...)
That's right, Wocky. It's yours.
Ah, take a closer look. Here, in particular... ...where it says "Nurse". ...It's signed "Alita Tiala".
Could you tell us a bit about the circumstances of your meeting?
(He seems preoccupied with something else...)
(If these sandals belong to Ms. Tiala... ...then is this print hers, too?)
No... Nothing.
(I... suppose he is a doctor still...)
Mr. Eldoon! Is everything OK?
Mr. Eldoon...
Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this?
That's what we want to know! That chart belongs to my client.
C-Can you tell us why?
(No way... It's like he's a completely different person...)
That's right.
Why would it still be in there after the operation to remove it?
...
B-But Wocky's operation was already a half-year ago!
(Great... Just great...)
Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this?
(Better hear what he has to say while he's in a talkative mood...)
There's one problem...
This chart... Look at the "Nurse" section... ...Alita Tiala.
Yeah, the problem is, she knew. She knew about Wocky's condition, guaranteed.
Why didn't she ever tell him?
(It doesn't make sense... If she knew her patient was in serious danger... ...you'd think she'd want to get that second operation before getting engaged!)
(What were you thinking, Alita Tiala...?)
No clues here.
Hey, give me a break! I'm just a beginner at this!
(Plaster, here comes Justice! *sigh*)
Yeah, I went to bed at 1:00 AM or so.
...3:00 AM.
Th-That voice...
...Mr. Wright!
(OK, see, this is why I don't buy their "father-daughter" relationship.) So, Mr. Wright! Do you know who the prosecution's witness is?
(She's going to be a witness!?)
(Something's going down today, that much is clear!)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
The "outside"...?
Bullets carry marks from the barrel that fired them, called "rifling marks".
And when did you first hear about Wocky's plan?

That was the day of the murder, correct?
So, you were there at the time?

That must have been, um, quite frightening.
(Great, now he sounds like a psychopath...)

So, is it easy to take a pistol out from the house?
(Sounds like he has a taste for sweets... and danger.)

"What happened"... meaning the murder.

How can you say that for certain? How!?
(Could someone else have used that pistol...?)
I'm sure there was another person who could have used that pistol... ...... I just can't think of who.
(Uh oh, this is bad if I leave it like this...!)
(Was there really no one else with access to that pistol? Someone else with Family ties...?)
Based on your testimony, there was clearly another... One other person had access to that pistol!


Oh...
(Ugh...)

N-No thanks, I think I know.
(Yowch... That didn't go so well...)
(...I'm a little more concerned for her fiancé. Why would she testify against him like this...?)
Well, of course, I mean you, Ms. Tiala.
You were quite clear when you told the court: You heard about the pistol from the defendant on the day of the murder. In other words, you knew what he was planning.
(I'd hope you'd do more than hesitate!) But what if a different connection could be proven? A connection between the witness and the victim? We might find that she had a personal motive beyond wanting to help her fiancé.
I have evidence showing a connection between the witness Ms. Tiala and the victim!

"Sandals", actually. Ms. Tiala, do these look familiar to you?
I would think so. These sandals were found in the Meraktis Clinic lobby.

But the fact is that they don't. They belong to you. We found toe prints on these sandals.
Requesting permission to match the prints with the witness's feet, Your Honor!
...So what!?

Nice try, Ms. Tiala. But the defense is in possession of evidence... ...that proves a connection between you and that clinic!
The evidence that connects her to the Meraktis Clinic is...!


Gee, thanks.
(I'll take the usual penalty next time, thanks.)
Found inside a safe at the Meraktis Clinic. I'd like to draw the court's attention to the names written on the chart.
Well, care to explain the meaning of this, Ms. Tiala?
...! (Our warm little fiancée just froze over!)
"Now"...?

"There's no connection now" doesn't fly in a court of law.
(She's one tough nut. She probably feels right at home with the Kitakis!) You left your job at the Meraktis Clinic, true... But these sandals prove that you remained connected!

"There's no connection now" doesn't fly in a court of law.
(She's one tough nut. She probably feels right at home with the Kitakis!) You left your job at the Meraktis Clinic, true... But you remained connected somehow!


Gee, thanks.
(I'll take the usual penalty next time, thanks.)
These sandals were found in the Meraktis Clinic lobby. ...They're yours, aren't they?

Well, see, that's because... (...there isn't one?)
(...One more try! I'll get it this time!)
Your sandals were found in the entrance to the clinic... Which means you went there on the day of the murder!
(Ack! He pointed out the contradiction before me!)
(Oh, what the...! No fair! He's filling the holes in her testimony...)

Around what time did you go to the clinic?
And that was the first time you had contacted Dr. Meraktis in half a year?

Did you want Dr. Meraktis to run away?
Couldn't you have called? Why go in person?

You mean that act of malpractice on Wocky, correct?

No "dark secrets", eh?
(She's hiding something, I know it! I must have some evidence that proves it, too...)

This chart was found inside a safe in the doctor's office.
Why would this one chart be in that safe? Ms. Tiala, you know why it was, don't you?
Dr. Meraktis didn't have the leisure of making "mistakes". That's why he wrote up a false report, and kept the truth locked away.
And this is where you come in, Ms. Tiala.
The nurse who filed this chart was you, which means... ...you knew about Wocky's failed operation!
You were in the same position as Dr. Meraktis! Kind of makes it hard to claim "no connection", doesn't it?
...!
...!
(My bracelet's reacting again!)
I felt my bracelet vibrate just now...
Just like yesterday. Like you said!
Eh...? (Then what's my bracelet reacting to?)
What has to be it?
Huh...?
I don't know about that, Trucy! I don't have some kind of special power or anything.
Well, then what do we do!?
(Then it's up to me and my bracelet... I don't know why, but the bracelet helps. Somehow, touching it helps me focus. Let's give it a shot and bring down that testimony!)

But your signature was on that chart.
(She's hiding something, I can smell it... And I bet she's got a habit that gives it away! I just have to focus to find her nervous habit! Maybe it's time to give my bracelet a rub...)

Why go to the clinic for a half-year-old chart now, you ask? But, you know why you would go "now", don't you.
It was quite clear, Ms. Tiala. You have a nervous habit. The moment you said the word "now"... ...you used your right thumb to fiddled [sic] with your ring.
(She was unsure... I saw it! "Now"... That's the key word!) The chart wasn't a part of your past... It was a clear and present threat!
Indeed.
Which means something happened quite recently... Something to make that chart a problem for you now.
(I've got her on the ropes now, I can feel it! Time to strike the killing blow... with evidence!) ...Ms. Tiala. There's no use trying to hide it. The chart became a threat to you now... because of this!


Um...
(Ribbit! I mean, ack! I can't lose this now! C'mon toad brain, one more try!)
A health check-up report.. belonging to the defendant. The Kitakis are trying to get out of the business. The health check-up this month was their first ever... ...What did you think when you heard about this?
Oh? I would think you were positively beside yourself. Because you were afraid. You knew what Wocky's chest X-ray would reveal!
A full half year had passed since the operation. You thought you were home free... ...when the chart came back to haunt you!
That's all, Your Honor.
That's correct. She said she had no connection to the Meraktis Clinic. But her connection was deep indeed... A bit too deep. If the Kitakis got a hold of this chart with her name... ...she'd be finished. Isn't that right, Ms. Tiala?
(I-I did it! I broke her testimony!)
...!
Wh-Whaaaat!?
(Grr! I was so close!)

We already know you're lying about having no reason!
Huh...?
S-Sorry... (Maybe I need to do some face training, too...)

But, then you'd be betraying Wocky, wouldn't you?

How did Dr. Meraktis respond to the warning?
(Yeah, real impressive the way you stood up to the attack of the Amazing Mr. Hat, sir...)
("Nothing happened" in Dr. Meraktis's office that day, huh...)
I know, I know... But we can't prove "when" it happened. Nor that Alita Tiala was in any way involved...

(There's no way she went to that clinic just to "warn" him!)
(Time to figure out what really happened at that clinic... and fast!)
You say "nothing happened" in the doctor's office. I disagree. Take a look at this.
This bullet was found in the Meraktis Clinic office. Something did "happen" in that office, Ms. Tiala!

Ah, but this was stuck inside the doctor's safe.

Weren't you the one who explained rifling marks to us?
The pistol was taken from the Kitaki Mansion that day. If the marks on this bullet match the murder weapon... ...then that proves a firearm was discharged in that office on the day of the murder!
...The bullet in that safe proves one fact: A pistol was fired in that office on that day. And at the time of the firing, the safe was open. The safe which contained the top-secret chart.
Only one person was in a position to do such a thing. Our witness, Alita Tiala!
Alita Tiala knew about Wocky Kitaki's botched operation! She got engaged to him without telling him about it! As long as that bullet remained in his chest, his days were numbered. What if she married him, and then the bullet finally reached its destination!
...Huh? Me!?
Um, I think you mean "accuse"...!
W... Wocky!
Just cool down a second, please!
Something funny?
So... The Family fortune is what you're really after!
Who, me?
...Accuse.
Huh?
What...?
Wait, but...
T-Trucy...?

That's only because he's trying to protect you!
...!
(He... He's right!)
Don't forget! We've proven that you were at the Meraktis Clinic on the day of the crime!
...Ah! Th-That was you!?
(...Someone's in there!)
A break-in! They left through that window!
So you were the burglar...
(Admitting the little crime to avoid the big one, eh?)

Why "that day"?
Well, they thought the crime scene was the park.
(I'm kinda thankful for that sloppiness myself, actually...)

"Later"...?

But you could have stolen it!
We'll ask Wocky. He'll tell us!
Mmmmmnk! (He's right, isn't he...)

Y-Yeah, but... Um...

(I think we're seeing her true colors now...)
(My bracelet didn't react to anything this time... I guess that means there's nothing worth perceiving... Time to get old school!)
The doctor was shot in the right temple, yes?

But that testimony was proven to be a lie! Our egregious panty-snatcher, Mr. Stickler, did witness the crime... But he was standing to the north, next to the trash can where he tossed those panties! If Mr. Stickler shouted from this location, the bullet couldn't hit his right temple!
Wh-What...!?
... Do you remember, Trucy?

But his location was proven! You can't write that off as him being "mistaken"!
Show you... what?
(Wocky Kitaki was standing at the "Killer" mark... Wesley Stickler at the "Witness" mark... And of course Pal Meraktis was at the "Victim" mark...)
At the "killer" mark, of course!
............ Uh, that is a problem, isn't it?
The killer was standing at the "Witness" mark!
(I would be, wouldn't I...)
(I guess he really is the most likely suspect... Do I have some evidence that shows Mr. Stickler did it?)

(Ugh... That wasn't it...)
(Maybe he's right...)
(Hey, that was a bit uncalled for, don't you think!?) Your Honor, the defense would like to reconsider!
As the facts stand now, we can't explain this crime... ...without contradicting ourselves at some point. But I know why. The real killer shot from an entirely different location!
Eh?
...Challenge accepted. (It's Justice time!)
(The key is the witness, Mr. Stickler's testimony! If we believe that, and we know where he stood... ...and the victim turned when he shouted... ...there's only one place the killer could have been!) The killer shot the victim from... here!


This is where the killer shot from!
(...No fair.)

This is where the killer shot from!
None of us did, Your Honor!
... I hadn't thought of that.
(Fine, rub it in...)
I believe we all owe a debt of gratitude... ...to Ms. Alita Tiala.
Thanks to you, we had a chance to review the crime... ...and this time, we were prepared. We know that Wesley Stickler was telling the truth! We should have listened to him from the beginning. Wesley Stickler was standing next to the trash can when he saw the two men. ...He shouted, just as he told us in his testimony. ...And the victim turned to look in his direction. A shot was fired! The victim was hit in the right temple.
Oh yes! Which direction was his right temple facing at that moment? That's right! Toward the noodle stand!

There's something we should worry about before that! Why was he pulling the noodle stand in the first place!?
(Can I prove that...?) You want evidence that someone was in that stand...?
...I've got it right here.
Well, too bad!
...Kidding! Just kidding! I've got it! (...Whew, close one.)


(Ugh... Time to pick something else...)
"The Meraktis Clinic"... And they're covered with paint. These slippers were found in a trash can near the crime scene.
A single slipper print was found at the scene... ...Right next to the noodle stand!
Oh, and Ms. Tiala. Your toe print was found in the left slipper!
In other words... ...this is proof you were inside that noodle stand!

...Observe the diagram! A park pathway runs right next to the slipper mark! A slipper wouldn't leave a trace on a cobblestone path!
Why not!?

That's... That's just dumb!
...?
I can prove one thing. Someone did scheme to clear space in that stand!


(Ack! ...That wasn't it. Maybe if I submit another piece of evidence while he's thinking...)
(Oops...)
This is a noodle bowl from the stolen Eldoon's Noodles noodle stand.
We discovered a large quantity of these bowls yesterday... ...in the lobby of the Meraktis Clinic!
Mr. Eldoon was very clear about those bowls.
Yet the bowls were removed! That night, there was space inside that noodle stand! Space created at the Meraktis Clinic, no less. Right around the time that you were there, Ms. Alita Tiala!
(This is it! Why was Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand that night...? ...And what was Alita Tiala doing inside it? Time to get to the bottom of this case!)
You knew about the botched operation... So you tried to get rid of the chart, to save yourself!
...Yes, Your Honor. (This is the last testimony! Either I perceive the truth, or it's over!)

So, you did go to steal that chart!
(But what if she did have a pistol...?)

It certainly would have put a damper on your wedding plans, I'd say.
Could we be a little less morbid!? Please!?

He didn't understand...?
(Please don't smile like that anymore... It's creepy.)

They "sent you"?

If that was really all that happened... ...what were all those noodle bowls doing there?
(Do I detect uncertainty there...?)

(...This is my last chance!)
Yeah, actually... (I felt it respond...!)
(Time to perceive the truth! ...Here comes Justice!)
"All I did was talk"... and lie.
(I'm pretty sure about this one... I think I'm getting the hang of this. A little slip in confidence, and they give it all away.) The proof... is you, Ms. Tiala.
"All I did was talk to him", you claim... Yet you can't hide your own nervous twitch when you say those words!
You have a habit of scratching the area of your neck around the edge of your scarf.
(This is working better than I'd hoped! Her unconscious actions tell the truth she won't say. Habits and lies... Two dots... Connect the dots and find the truth!)
It seems that when you recall what really happened in that office... ...you can't keep your hands off your neck, can you?
(Hmm... It seems that nervous habits... ...are unconscious reactions that manifest when someone is trying to hide something!) You can't hide behind your scarf, Ms. Tiala! Something happened between you and the victim in the Meraktis Clinic office!
And I've got proof that shows exactly what happened!


Huh...?
(Ack! She found my habit! I'd better rethink this... OK, when we found the Meraktis Clinic office... ...there were signs of a struggle, and a bullet in the safe. Ms. Tiala was willing to do anything to get that chart. So something happened... But what?)
...You're touching your scarf again.
...There's something unusual about this lamp. The bulb is broken... and there's a red splotch on the cord.
Seeing how you hide your neck... I think I can come up with a plausible explanation for the lamp's state.
Very well. The answer is very simple. Ms. Alita Tiala... Please remove your scarf!

We'll find out soon enough if we're drifting... As soon as the witness removes her scarf.
...I knew it. So I was right, wasn't I, Ms. Alita Tiala!
Something did happen that night at the Meraktis Clinic! You needed to get that chart back, no matter what it took. Even if you had to steal your fiancé's pistol to do it!
Exactly. The victim in the clinic that night... ...was this witness! Specifically... ...you tried to threaten Dr. Meraktis and he attacked you! That's what happened that night at the Meraktis Clinic!
And what happened next!?
Eh...
Aaaaaaack!
(When did this happen!? Suddenly, everyone's sympathizing with her!)
W-What!?
But... she was choked hard enough to leave that mark! She would have been out for a while!
...! (Alita Tiala, half-dead... Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand... And a bullet fired from inside the noodle stand...)
Ms. Alita Tiala, as you can see... ...we're not through with you just yet.
Well, let's go back over what we've learned up till now. On the day of the murder, Wocky saw his check-up report. ...From which he learned about the bullet still inside him. So, he took a pistol from the Family stash... ...with the intent to give Dr. Meraktis some of "his own medicine".
But then... something happened.
But, what about Dr. Meraktis?
...!
(Maybe he did think he killed Alita Tiala... Do I have evidence to show what he did next...?)


This evidence shows what he did next!
(What, this smile?)
...As his next move, Dr. Meraktis... ...stole Guy Eldoon's noodle stand!
It wasn't so "random". Remember all the bowls in the clinic's foyer? Bowls that belonged inside that stand? I think it's pretty obvious, don't you? That stand was at the clinic. However, the question is why did he remove the bowls?
Or he wanted to put something in the stand in their place...
I do. Dr. Meraktis did replace those bowls with something... ...your "corpse", Ms. Tiala!
Dr. Meraktis panicked. He thought he'd killed you...

Then let's think about it... logically. The doctor had a place to dispose of you in mind... ...But on the way there... ...who should he run into but the defendant, Wocky Kitaki!

Tell me... Why would someone go to a "dead end"? ...Unless the park was his destination!


The victim was heading here!
............ I'm young, Your Honor. I'm still making up my mind about a lot of things.
(...Ugh.)
Yes, Your Honor. I scarcely need to explain why.
I believe this clears up all of the remaining questions. The victim pulling the stand, and the defendant before him. ...And inside the stand, you, Ms. Alita Tiala.
And then, the denouement. Wesley Stickler, of panty-snatching fame, walks up. Seeing the two men, he shouts! In that instant...
You were the only one who could have stolen Wocky's pistol. It had to be you!
...You mean, I'm right?
Whereof what!? (I can't believe she's still trying to deny this!)
...! (Ack, maybe there really is something!)
His car...?
Ack...!
Th-That's right...! That night, the car that hit Mr. Wright... ...was that green sports car!
Urk...!
No.. Nooooooooooo!
Uh... Umm...
......
(Everything I've learned...?)
Actually... It was someone else who stole that stand!
Well... Um... He would have had to steal it from someone else!
The victim... used the car to carry the body!
Well, if the car wasn't broken...
(What's going on...? Is Prosecutor Gavin trying to tell me something...?)
(I have an idea... It's all coming together!) ...That night, Dr. Meraktis couldn't use his car.
...Not according to my information, Ms. Tiala. Put one and one together, and the explanation is simple!


(Hah, hah, very funny, guys.)
Another crime was committed the night of the murder. The theft of these panties! The latest in a string of similar thefts, actually. But that night, the snatcher was caught in the act! A brave young girl chased the thief until they hid... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage.
The snatcher hid the panties there before running... ...Perhaps someone in this court remembers where he hid them?
...Exactly. By the way, I learned something yesterday... ...A very important piece of information. ...And I learned it from you, Prosecutor Gavin!
Your hog...?
While Ms. Tiala and the doctor were struggling... ...the panty-snatcher snuck into the Meraktis garage. From that time, until the time we found these... ...that car wouldn't start.
...Well, Ms. Tiala? This wraps your doubts up quite nicely, I think!
...Which is when you left that slipper print!
...That was your mistake.
Eh...
...
(I think he already knew... He'd figured out she was the killer a while ago...)
(He lost... but I didn't exactly win, either.)
Yeah, we did, somehow...
Ah! Mr. Kitaki...
...If not in jail. Wouldn't that be a happy ending.
Huh? I do? (Way to put me on the spot...)
(Why is Mr. Kitaki trying to become a business man...?)

Think about it, Wocky... Think about your condition.
I talked with your mother, Little Plum, yesterday.

(I think that means I messed up...)
(What was that she said...?)
(Wait, could she mean...?)
Mr. Kitaki! (I liked him more without the puppy dog eyes.)
Who? Me? I don't think...
(...He's opening a pie shop!?)
(And he was gone...)
Hey, since when do I work at your agency!?
(Huh... Why not. She did help me out. And there's a few questions that still need answers... Like this power of mine that she showed me... And my bracelet... If anyone can help me figure it out, it's her. Though I can't say I care much for what her father has become...)
Huh? Where?
...Ah, salty noodles. Right. He got his stand back already?
Please... anything but him.

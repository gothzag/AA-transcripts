(Boy am I nervous!)
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him, I owe him that much.
Yeah... that's him.
Um, yeah. *sigh*
Hey. Hey there, Larry.
What!? What's wrong, Larry?
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.
Y-Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)
Um... the defendant... is me, right?
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.
Um... Mia Fey?
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Um... Chief! Help me out!
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
She was struck once, by a blunt object.
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)
Um, Chief, what do I do now?
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.)
(Um... didn't they all die?)
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)
(TELL THE TRUTH)
(I'll send him a signal...)
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
(This is bad...)
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?
Lies! What?! He was lying!?
!!! How do I prove he's not?
Um... okay.
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Half-open... you say?
What gave you the idea to do that?
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Are you sure she was dead?
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Okay. What happened next?
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Why use a public phone?
Ah, right... what time did you call again?
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Leads to:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?
I've got this one.
You said "heard"... Not "saw"?
Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!
Leads to:
Are you sure it was a television and not... a radio?
Leads to:
How do you explain the gap!
Leads to:
A.. video?
True, true...
Leads to:
Are you sure the voice you heard said it was 1:00 PM?
Leads to:
Well, you just watch it! (Hmm... Not much point pressing him on that one, was there?)
Hold it right there! The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery! And this record proves it!
You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!
Gladly.
That strikes me as a very suspicious mistake.
A "table clock"? Was there a clock at the scene?
Leads to:
The... murder weapon?
(Something's fishy here...)
Leads to:
Why didn't you tell us that in the first place?
Leads to:
Wait just a moment! The murder weapon wasn't a clock. It was this statue! Now how is this supposed to be a clock?
Just answer the question, Mr. Sahwit.
I guess not. There was a clock on the scene, so, no problem.
Hey! You're right!
Yes... Yes I do!
Your Honor, there is a gaping hole in the witness's testimony!
The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand. Yet the witness testified that he never entered the apartment! Clearly, a contradiction!
The witness knew it was a clock, because he...
Tell me, isn't it true that you knew the victim? In fact, you were one of her "sugar daddies"! Be frank with us, Mr. Sahwit!
Huh? Oh, really?
Y-yes, Your Honor. Let me think this over.
You're lying! You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!
I'll do better than that! I can prove you were the one who killed her! You struck her with the clock, and the shock of the blow triggered the clock's voice! That was the sound you heard!
Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Sahwit. The sound must have left quite an impression on you. Understandable, since the murder weapon spoke just as you hit the victim! That voice was burned into your mind. That's why you were so certain about the time!
Baseless...? Just look at the witness's face!
Your Honor?
(The whole case is riding on this! I'd better think it through carefully!) Yes, Your Honor. The sound Mr. Sahwit heard was definitely this clock. A fact which is clear if you simply...
All you have to do is examine the batteries!
Yes, the clock was working fine!
... Umm, I'm sorry, I think I got confused back there with all those testimonies.
Y-yes, Your Honor. As I was saying...
All you have to do is talk to the victim's neighbors!
I'm sure one of them heard the clock tell the time when the incident occurred!
I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! Let me think about it again!
Let's sound the clock now, here in this court. Your Honor, may I have the clock? I ask the court to listen very carefully...
Well, he is "The Thinker," after all.
Mr. Payne... can you tell me what time it is now?
As you can see, this clock is exactly three hours slow! Precisely the discrepancy between what Mr. Sahwit heard and the actual time of death! So, Mr. Sahwit... Try to talk your way out of this one!
(Uh oh... what's he talking about...?)
...! (He's right! How am I going to prove that!? Dammit! I was so close!)
...! Yes, Your Honor.
(Grr! I almost had him! Sorry, Larry... I failed you. There's nothing I can do about it now...)
Mia! I mean, Chief!
But, Chief, it's over. I can't prove the clock was slow the day of the murder! Nobody can prove that!
... Wait! Maybe I can prove it!
Of course. There is a piece of evidence in the Court Record that can prove my claim beyond a doubt!
H-how am I supposed to know that!?
Y-y-yes, Your Honor!
(This is it... all or nothing!) Yes, Your Honor. I believe I have the evidence that can prove my claim!
Leads to:
Judge:
(D'oh! That wasn't it!) One more chance... Give me just one more chance!
The victim had just returned home from abroad the day before the murder. As we all know, the time difference between here and Paris is nine hours! When it's 4:00 PM here, it's 1:00 AM the next day there. The clock wasn't three hours slow, it was nine hours fast! The victim hadn't reset her clock since returning home! That's why the time you heard when you struck her dead in her apartment was wrong! Proof enough for you, Mr. Sahwit? Or should I say... Mr. Did It!
Yes, Your Honor.
Thank you, Your Honor.
It turns out that Frank Sahwit was a common burglar! He posed as a newspaper sales-man to check and see when people were out of the house! That day... When Larry went to her apartment, the victim wasn't home. After he left, Mr. Sahwit let himself in to do his dirty work! While he was searching her place, the victim returned! Flustered, Mr. Sahwit grabbed the nearest blunt object he could find...
(Whew... I still can't believe we won!)
Th-thanks, Chief. I owe it all to you.
(I've never seen the chief looking this happy... If she's this glad, imagine how Larry must feel!)
Larry! You're supposed to be happy! What's wrong now!?
Good! Wait, no! I mean... Bad! Bad bad bad! Larry, you're innocent! The case is closed.
(Larry, she was a... Nah... Never mind.)
(Hey, I was the one who got you off the hook!)
Larry...
H-huh? Oh, yeah, right! (What the heck is she talking about?)
Check this out, Larry. Proof Positive you weren't just some chump to her.
This is the clock YOU made for her, Larry! And she took it with her when she traveled.
You think so? It's a pretty heavy clock to take traveling.
Well, make of it what you will.
(Hope that made him feel a little better...)
Here you go, Larry. Proof.
(Guess that wasn't the right thing to show him...)
Yeah, I guess so!
Yeah!
Er, yeah. Part, at least.
And so, my first trial came to a close. Larry slapped me on the back and said, "Gee, Nick, it's good to have friends!" But I'm pretty sure he's not going to pay us. Unless you count the clock he gave Mia. ... I didn't know it then... but that clock was soon going to be at the center of another incident. And my promise to tell the chief about me and Larry... would be one promise that I wouldn't be able to keep.
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Huh? Really?
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)

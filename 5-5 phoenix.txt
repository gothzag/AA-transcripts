No one can escape their past. The sins we've committed... and the sadness we've caused... No matter how far we run, our past remains... ...as ever-present as the moon in the sky. It looms in wait... for the day when we are forced to face it. But only in doing so can we truly make peace and move on in hope towards tomorrow.
(They took Athena from the courtroom, straight to the station. She's probably being questioned at this very moment.) ............ (After this past year, I took it for granted that those two would always be here. But now, Apollo has gone off on his own to seek his own truth... ...and my pursuit of the truth only ended up with Athena becoming the new suspect. Some boss I turned out to be...)
Yeah... It seems so empty, too.
Yeah... And I still believe it was... At least, based on what we know.
During the trial for the bombing and murder that occurred at the Cosmos Space Center... ...the lighter used by the real culprit was found. This lighter proved the defendant, Solomon Starbuck, innocent. But Athena's prints were found on it instead... ...and she was subsequently arrested for the murder.
(No, none of it does. I've been racking my brain, but I just can't figure it out! Argh! Where is the flaw in my reasoning? What have I got wrong in this case?)
Of course I will! And thanks, Trucy. I needed that push. (Trucy's right! The trial is tomorrow. There's no time to waste! If I'm going to prove Athena's innocence, I'd better get out there and find some evidence!)
(Great! But before we go, I'd better tidy up the evidence I have on hand...)
(Athena is probably still in the middle of being questioned... ...so Trucy's right. The thing to start with is talking to people at the Space Center.)
It was so sudden.
I don't think it's your fault, Trucy.
I really don't think it was your fault, Trucy. But I didn't realize Apollo was wearing so many hats around here, either.
A conspiracy, huh? Well, it certainly is some kind of mistake, that's for sure.
Isn't that exactly the same as the plot of the movie you watched the other day?
Ha ha ha. So it's just a trick to you, huh?
I don't care if I get laughs, as long as I can clear my client's name.
I'm no match for you, though, Trucy.
Ha ha ha. It's not like taking somebody to an amusement park, you know.
F-Fine. I'll take you on my next day off.
Ha ha ha. (I'm no match for Trucy...)
That's true. You can make anything disappear.
I guess only a space probe can help us figure out how they work then, huh.
Director Cosmos! Do you have a minute?!
Director! (He scooted away...)
(Yeah, well, I dragged his name through the mud pretty good at the trial earlier today...)
We were here only yesterday... Oh, hey! Mr. Starbuck! You've been released, huh?
Wh-What's wrong? (I thought he'd be happy to be acquitted...)
(H-He saw Athena?)
(Yeah, that sounds like Athena. I can just picture it.)
(We can't have that either, Mr. Starbuck!) Don't worry, Mr. Starbuck. I'm going to give her the very best defense I can. I promise to get her acquitted, just like I did for you.
What could have made Director Cosmos do such a thing?
I imagine he must have. Surely he would've noticed when you went to board the rocket.
Well... That's just how he is.
Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer?
(Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...)
Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped.
But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short?
And he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right?
No, but like attracts like, as they say.
Do you know anything about this piece of evidence?
No, no. It's all right. There's no need to get all depressed!
The door... Ah, yes... As I recall, they opened this door here as they made their escape...
You mean the launch pad and the Space Museum are switched right now?
So they're recreating the conditions, huh? (I'd like to see what's beyond that door now.) Mr. Starbuck, could you open this door for us?
Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?
But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right?
(I hear you... Times sure are tough...)
Sure. Let's go.
Huh? I wonder what these dead leaves are doing here?
(She's right. It's a modern, state-of-the-art building, but it's surrounded by trees.) But I don't know. If they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes... ...wouldn't they look more crushed up? These don't look like they've been stepped on.
Not everything is set up like a magician's stage, you know.
So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh?
That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2.
(Well, I don't see anything else that jumps out at me. And I imagine this corridor is built exactly like the Launch Pad 1 corridor.)
Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?
But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right?
(I hear you... Times sure are tough...)
I guess the police are trying to re-create the conditions of the crime.
Yeah, it looks like that door opens from the corridor side without fingerprint verification.
That's right. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2.
(I don't know. Those leaves didn't look like they'd been stepped on to me...)
Director Cosmos! Wait!
(Trucy's knife throw was a direct hit to one of his tires!)
(Maybe I should've kept a closer watch on what tricks she's been practicing...)
Nah. I bet all that button will do is make it go haywire again.
Director Cosmos, when you were talking in court about switching the launch pads... ...you used your right to remain silent about the reason as to why.
I'd like Director Cosmos to tell us... ...why he switched the two launch pads to begin with.
(No secrets left, huh? I beg to differ. Looks like I'll have to undo his Psyche-Locks if I want to get to the bottom of this.)
He was an exceptional man, wasn't he.
(Someone needs to teach him he is not the literal center of the cosmos...)
Wow. That historic, huh?
Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work.
Excuse me, but about this piece of evidence...
What? Uh, not much, I guess...
(If he's any more self-absorbed, he'll turn into his very own black hole.)

I want you to tell me everything you're hiding about the switching of the two launch pads.
(I hope I never get like this when I'm old... Now, let's see. Where to start?) This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...
You said your motive was to fool the bomber, right?
(Huh? Ugh, I guess I got it wrong.) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial.
You said your motive was to prevent the bombing, right?
(Well, I never said that last bit...) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial.
Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast. Instead, they safely boarded the Museum's rocket, far away from the actual explosion.
...I agree you couldn't have done it without help. For one, they would have figured it out the instant they stepped into the Space Museum. You figured you could fool Mr. Starbuck once he'd been drugged with his medication, but... ...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.


It wasn't this person, was it?
(Oh... Guess I was right about being wrong...) ...Well, I did say it "WASN'T this person," didn't I? But I still contend that...
You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.
He stole the tranquilizers from his mentor's locker and slipped them to him. And then, with Mr. Starbuck in a daze, they boarded the replica rocket in the museum!
(How is he able to spin around like that...?)
If you really wanted to save the astronauts' lives... ...shouldn't you just have called off the launch?
(I guess he must've had a compelling reason why he couldn't call it off...) But how did you know to switch the pads in advance of the bombing incident?
But it was just a warning. It could even have been a prank. Why did you believe in it so completely?
Oh? I didn't realize channeling was back in vogue. ...Besides, I thought it was you yourself that got the warning via telephone.
(AKA, a regular ol' telephone.)
The bomber said, "It's been a while"...? And that was enough to make you take the threat seriously? (Perhaps Director Cosmos took the threat so seriously... ...because the Space Center had been involved in a bombing once before? Maybe... ...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!)
It was the courtroom bombing, wasn't it?! That's when you were dealt a major blow!
Gaaagh... (I guess I got it wrong... The director felt personally threatened, so it has to be something more relevant to him. )
The HAT-2 bombing. That must be where the answer to your secret lies.
Aaaaaaagh! You got me! (Unh... I guess I was way off on that one... Now, let's see...)
The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival... People across the nation know it now as a heroic tale of bravery. But in truth, it was an act of sabotage perpetrated by our current killer, wasn't it? Very few knew about the previous plot, so when the caller said, "It's been a while"... ...you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the danger was real, and it wasn't a prank!
(Sabotage, murder... So this is the ugly truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle.)
(...Huh? Wait a minute... The murder at the Space Center seven years ago...! This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.)


(...I guess I picked the wrong person. Although I do like the sound of a zero-g nap right about now... But that will have to wait! I still have a Psyche-Lock left to break!)
Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago. That place and time of the two incidents -- the murder and the sabotage -- were the same. So you thought that he committed both crimes. But while Prosecutor Blackquill was behind bars, you got another threatening call. If the culprit this time is the same as seven years ago, then it isn't Simon Blackquill. Realizing that, you were shaken. It meant the true culprit's been running free all this time.
(The reason why Director Cosmos won't talk about why he switched the launch pads... ...is connected to the truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle. The sabotage and murder that happened at this Space Center seven years ago...) Director Cosmos, tell us what you're hiding!
Seven years ago... You mean the so-called "HAT-1 Miracle"?
(So Mr. Starbuck's traumatic experience wasn't accidental...)
So... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...?
(Someone's watching way too many late-night movies.) Well, I guess if we're talking about blowing up a rocket and stealing research material... ...it's not all that surprising that a spy could be behind it all.
The same MO as this time...
(Aren't ninjas and spies basically the same thing?)
Don't tell me they made the police rush the investigation?
And that was "The HAT-1 Miracle," wasn't it? (But then, seven years later, the same MO -- advance warning of sabotage... That must've been the director's reason for switching the launch pads.)
Seven years ago, the spy gave you advance warning of their plans, just like this time. That was what made you decide to switch the launch pads, wasn't it?
("Moving"? Really? Maybe if you're easily inspired by political talking points...)
You did that so normal visitors wouldn't enter, right? What else did you do?
But you didn't let Mr. Starbuck in on it?
(Wait, what did he mean by the Hope capsule was lost in that blast...?)
I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside.
So what kind of samples are they? What's in them?
(Yet another casualty of that blast...)
What? H-How?
A wire on that phone?
And planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off.
So you really think the same spy is behind this incident and the one seven years ago?
Then, this spy... must be the "phantom" Prosecutor Blackquill has been chasing...
That's right. We can clear Athena's name. And then there's the matter of Prosecutor Blackquill, too.
Well, IF the culprit of seven years ago is the same person as in the current incident... ...it would mean Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent. That's stil an "if," though...
Well, at least he'll be in good company. There must be planets out there he can spin with. Which reminds me... I'd like to delve a little deeper into the HAT-1 mission, too.
I'm sure he'll stop when he gets dizzy. Let's go visit the Space Museum!
Looks like we won't get any investigating done here now. Let's come back later.
There, that's the HAT-1 exhibit.
There's Clay, and Mr. Starbuck, Director Cosmos, Aura Blackquill, and even Ponco. ...But I've never seen the woman on the right before.
Let's check out the newspaper article, too. "HAT-1 Launch Imminent"... And there's a photo of the Hope space probe. I guess it's only natural it doesn't talk about the murder or the sabotage.
It must be the HAT-1 team's uniform jacket. It's the same design as the one Apollo was wearing, the one that belonged to Clay.
Not a replica, huh? (I wonder if it was Mr. Starbuck's?)
Oh, Ms. Woods! What brings you here?
You must be so worried! But rest assured. I'm going to do my very best to defend her.
Huh? You mean the Cosmos Space Center?
Sh-She did?! No, I didn't know... (No wonder she knew so much...) Ms. Woods, could you tell me more, in detail?
But why was a psychology specialist working at a space research facility?
So it was far from Athena's first time here. I wonder why she didn't mention it?
A sad memory...? Can you tell me about it?
(The same time frame as the HAT-1 launch...)
(Poor Athena... And all this time, she never let on at all...)
And so the first time you'd seen her in seven years was during Prof. Courte's case?
What was Athena like as a child?
(It must be hard to hear people's hearts as well as their voices...)
(Huh. I wonder what kind of research it was?)
(Atta girl! Good idea.)
Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?
Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch?
Just as I suspected...
(So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case.
Ack! Okay! Sorry to bother you! (I guess she doesn't have leads on that.)
Thank you for all your help, Ms. Woods. And please, try not to worry. I won't let anything happen to Athena.
The Detention Center first, then. We have to see Athena before visiting hours are over!
Oh, hello, Detective Fulbright. Here on business?
The one behind the courtroom bombing incident?!
...Really? Us? Are you sure?
(Like I'd waste my breath on you. After all, you're the one who assaulted Apollo and put him in the hospital!)
"No violence"?! Too bad Apollo didn't get a chance to say that before you attacked him!
Fine. Then just answer me this, Mr. Tonate. What is this "truth" of yours about the courtroom you blew up?
Wh-What?!
Easy there, Trucy... I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess he must not be lying.
(Wow. They've laid it all out, piece by piece...)
(Uh-oh. Looks like his geek switch has been activated...)
(What bad timing... Looks like we'll have to wait until after her questioning is over to see her.)
All right. Sounds like a plan.
You know this character?
(I had no idea this thing was so popular.)
Well, as a lawyer, I'd like to avoid both of them if I can help it.
Wow. That historic, huh?
Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work.
But, in the end, the mission was a success.
(A miracle through sheer will, huh? I think I know what he means all too well...)
(...And where people were directed to evacuate from via the emergency ladder. This is where Athena's mother was killed seven years ago...) Speaking of someone who works with robots...
(Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?)
And I respect his wishes. We just came to investigate this lab.
("The princess," huh? Guess she's talking about Athena...) Of course! Athena is innocent.
(I can't believe it... Does Apollo really suspect Athena?!)
"Mr. Terran"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to...
(A robot that can see ghosts? Yeah, right! And I'M a spirit medium!) Sorry, but apparently, scientists just don't tell very frightening ghost stories. I intend to defend Athena, no matter what you have to say about it.
Could you tell me about the incident seven years ago?
(Huh? Apollo knows about that case, too...?)
(Y-Yikes! Better watch what you say if you don't want to get recycled, Clonco!)
Hearts? Robots with hearts? Can you even make such a thing?
(Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.)
(The robots are all that's left? Isn't she leaving out a very important someone...?)
What do you mean by that?
(I'm not so sure that gives you the right to physically abuse the poor things...)
Well... we believe the culprit of that incident might be the same person as in this case.
Yes, Prosecutor Blackquill... or so it seems.
I can't say anything for sure right now. But that's exactly why I'd like to hear your side of it, to help me be sure.
Ah, Prosecutor Blackquill's forte... his infamous "power of suggestion" technique.
(Huh. He seems more like a lost soul than a dignified samurai to me...)
(Now I think I see why Athena didn't say anything when we ran into Aura yesterday. It all makes sense now.)
(I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...)
(Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.)
It's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about.
Can you tell me anything about this piece of evidence?
What a... pleasant response.
What does it settle?
Uh, we're not the police, so we don't have one...
Aaaaagh...!
What a way to get shown out...
I guess that's just how she is.
(I guess it's because they have something in common... Apollo lost Clay, just like how Aura lost Dr. Cykes.)
I guess that's true... (Does she mean he's usually silly and dorky?)
Hey, wait! Trucy! Come back! ............ (She's gone. Hmm... What should I do now? Detective Fulbright is probably still questioning Athena. Guess I'll go back to the office... alone. *sigh*)
(Well, here I am... This office has never felt so... empty.) I guess I haven't been here at the office all by myself in a long time. *sigh* (When I first became a lawyer, my mentor was here with me... And, after that, there was always someone by my side. Now I'm getting all sentimental. I muse be tired...) Huh? There's something on the floor... What's a letter doing here? "Hey, Nick! It's been a while, huh? Miss me?" (I know this handwriting!)
(I think she, or whatever paper she's reading is a little off on the details...)
...Yours truly, Maya Fey. (Good ol' Maya. It's as if she knew I was feeling down and needed a lift.) Maya was my assistant for quite a while. Believe it or not, but she's a spirit medium. This Magatama I use on Psyche-Locks... Maya is the one who gave it to me. But I wonder how this letter got here?
AAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Oh, it's you, Pearls!
This is Pearl Fey, though I call her "Pearls." She is Maya's cousin, who is also a spirit medium. A very talented one, at that. I've known her since she was eight years old. But Apollo and Athena only met her a few months ago.
You didn't come all this way just to bring me a letter, did you?
(She's even further off on the details than Maya.) I wish I could take you out to eat or something, Pearls, but there's a lot going on...
Huh? There's more? ...Oh, yeah. Here it is. "P.S."
Oh, so that's what you're doing here. That's awfully nice of you, Pearls. (Maya and Pearls. Thanks to these two... ...I'm starting to feel a little better. Thank you, girls.)
(I'll need to talk to Prosecutor Blackquill if I want to learn more about his case. With the trial still going on, they must be holding him down at the Detention Center.)
Yes, quite a while. She used to drop by the office sometimes to say hello... ...but she hasn't been by recently. I wonder what she's up to these days?
I'll have to have some burgers delivered to her, then.
............I hope she tips them well, then.
Thanks. I generally try to look good if I'm going to be in court.
Huh? No, that's not exactly my intention...
She couldn't compare it to something cool, like a lion's mane?
I remember you helping me conduct my investigations from time to time.
Thanks. You always provide such great assistance.
(I don't know what I'd do if Pearls wasn't here right now.)
I bet you find vacation pamphlets especially exciting, huh?
Well, the office is just full of them. You can have as many of them as you'd like.
(Poor kid. I wish I could take her on a real vacation.)
It used to have a bomb in it, you know.
Ha ha ha. It must've been starving, huh? You'd have to be pretty hungry to want to eat a bomb.
Ha ha ha. I promise. (She looks genuinely worried for me.)
No, no, no. It's okay. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. (I feel like we've had this conversation before...)
(Well, look who's here... I wonder what they're talking about?)
(Prosecutor Blackquill!)
("When there's no tomorrow"? What is she talking about?)
(Wow... I could cut the tension with a katana...)
What? ...Oh. Yeah, he did. (You bounced back to business quick!)
Don't worry about it. I plan to defend her and prove her innocence.
(...Th-This is bladeproof glass, right...?)
Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago. You're looking for somebody you call "the phantom of seven years past," aren't you?
(...Th-This glass is absolutely, positively bladeproof... right...?)
Ouch. (At least it wasn't my fault!)
Could you tell me who this "phantom" is? And also, you didn't really kill Dr. Cykes, did you...?
Prosecutor Blackquill! Please listen to me! The culprit in the current case might be the same as the one in the case seven years ago! If you would cooperate, we could probably solve both cases!
(Prosecutor Blackquill...)
Ungh... I swear I'll get her acquitted! You'll see!
(I'm more than aware of how hard it's going to be, thank you very much!)
............So............ what do you think?
(Looks like it wasn't important enough to warrant even a contemptuous "Hmph"...)
............There he goes.
(There isn't much we CAN do...) ...Detective Fulbright? Do you mind if I ask you just a little more about that old case?
Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted?
(I don't want to think about that one.)
Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they?
The only one, huh? (Ouch. That does sound pretty decisive...) Could you show me that footage?
(I guess I'll have to see it some other time.)
And what was the second piece of evidence?
W-Wow... (It'd be hard to explain this one away...)
But who took this picture, Detective?
(Prosecutor Blackquill's attitude earlier was so odd... He's definitely hiding something.) Prosecutor Blackquill said he was hunting a phantom from seven years ago, didn't he?
Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...?
So he was given... the death sentence...
What?! Tomorrow?! (No...)
But what if the culprit of the current case is the same as the one from seven years ago?
But that would be unthinkable! We have to do something... right now!
I know! But why?! Why isn't Prosecutor Blackquill putting up any kind of a fight?
(Uncooperative... when he's about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit?! This isn't right...! I can't let it happen! I have to stop it somehow!)
No, no, no! this is an important piece of evidence!
(That's quite a reaction. I bet he's making some big show of it right now.)
Detective Fulbright, get a hold of yourself. Some kind of robot malfunction?
They did WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! (No... Trucy!)
(The riot police are here. Then, the robots really are holding people hostage?!)
I recognize that voice! Detective Fulbright, are you okay here on your own?
Pearls! Over here!
Thanks, Pearls. I can hardly believe what's happening myself...
(Clonco seems to be the same as before.)
Uh-oh! (There IS something wrong with him!)
Um, Clonco?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (The robots are rebelling!)
(Wh-What?!)
(Huh? There's something being displayed on Clonco's face screen.) It's... the Space Museum!
Trucy? Trucy, is that you?! No... Trucy, are you all right?!
Trucy! Trucy! Talk to me!!!
(Athena...?)
But you need me to buy some time, right? Got it. I'll see what I can do. But promise me... Promise me you'll never hand Athena over, and you won't give up on the hostages, either.
(I have no idea yet. But this hostage-taker... Could it be...?)
("Princess"...? "Hunk of Junk"...? There's only one person this could be... ...in which case, there must be something I can use as a bargaining chip!)
(Prosecutor Blackquill!)
............ Ms. Hostage-Taker, Athena is not a murderer.
I'm telling you the truth. Look, the person you want is the real killer, right? Well, it's NOT Athena. It's someone else.
I don't know yet. But the culprit is the same as the one in the case from seven years ago. The UR-1 Incident... I believe you have a personal interest in that case?
But is it really too late? You can still do something about it. You might even be able to fix it...
(What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?)
How about we do a reenactment of the case?
N-No! Wait (Gaaagh! I can't make another mistake here!)
Please tell me all about the case from seven years ago.
(This isn't working. I have to come up with something I can bargain with.)
I propose we retry the case from seven years ago. If you make that demand now, I'm sure nobody will deny you. It wouldn't be an official trial, but at least we could find out the truth!
(S-She will?)
Thanks, Pearls. I appreciate that. ...Okay! We're going in!
(Aura dropped us off with a warning not to touch anything until she got back...)
Even if we could, this mess makes it hard to tell what the room was like seven years ago.
Ack! It's the hostage-taker!
A-A guest?
Edgeworth! What are you doing here...? (This is Miles Edgeworth. We've been friends since we were kids. We faced off in court a number of times back when he was a prosecutor, but now...)
He's chief prosecutor now. Pretty soon, it'll be a year, right?
So what are you doing here, Edgeworth?
Wow, she's good. She went all the way up to the top!
Thanks. I appreciate this. I could really use the help.
Yeah, Athena's mother.
This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see.
(Yes, Detective Fulbright mentioned she was into Japanese culture...)
(Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.)
I heard his trial was over in a flash.
The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall.
Yeah. It's been eight years. I'm sorry for all I put you through.
Nah. I was the one that made the decision.
(W-Way to put pressure on a guy. And since when did I get such a brutal reputation?)
...Edgeworth, you don't think Athena's the culprit, do you?
And what about the hostage situation?
Edgeworth... (He may be a stickler for the rule of law, but I have no better ally in this world than him.)
They must've been very valuable.
...That's fine. Come what may, my top priority is to defend my clients.
But, that's the thing. I need to see how people will react in order to question them.
Aha ha ha! That doesn't happen... much...
So that means... he must still be hiding something.
Yeah, I know. The part about the spy, right?
Director Cosmos told me, after a bit of pressure. He told me espionage and sabotage were behind The Hat-1 Miracle.
We can stay the execution...?
Thanks, Edgeworth. Now all I have to do is comb this room for evidence.
Oh, look. It's a little robot. I wonder what it does? Cleaning, maybe?
Yikes! It talks!
(I guess "slack off" and "cut some corners" aren't in his vocabulary bank.)
Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me.
...Wait, before you do...
(Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.)
(It's... Metis Cykes...) Clonco, can I talk to you? (I really hope he's back to normal.)
(Hey, don't put me in the same class as that woman!) What was Aura like seven years ago at the time of the incident?
(Huh. So he calls Dr. Cykes "Mother," but Aura Blackquill "Miss Aura"...?)
(And before long, she started hating the court system, and abusing Clonco, huh...?)
(Ponco and Clonco. They're the "robots with hearts" that Dr. Cykes created.) A heartbeat detection system lets them determine when a human is present. In addition, they can recognize people by their ID tag or facial features... ...and they can infer people's emotions by analyzing their tone of voice. That's amazing. Hey, I don't know, Edgeworth. They might even be more human than you.
(It kind of sounds like these robots can do what Athena does...)
It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too.
Pearls! Don't touch th--
Hey! It's moving!
Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls.
It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too.
Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls.
An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation.
(I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?)
Hey, look at this row of rolling cases. I bet the wheels make it easier for people to move heavy research materials around.
I don't trust him not to push us down a flight of stairs...
What's this? A giant robot arm, maybe?
And there's a spiked ball and giant drill on the floor, too... Is Aura trying to build some kind of weapon of massive destruction?
(I can picture her gleefully tearing down the street doing just that... I'd better not think about it anymore.)
What's this? It looks like a giant power plug.
Wow. Machines that maintain themselves. That's pretty cool.
(Nothing motivates quite like fear, huh?)
This is one heck of a robot.
He's right, Pearls. There's no sign of it in the photo from seven years ago, either.
(So it was long gone by the time someone took this picture, huh.)
(That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?)
So the person who stole it... Think it was our spy?
It takes someone like Aura Blackquill to actually build something like this...
It's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench.
The first on the scene, huh? A staff member and two police officers, was it? (And they were here to collect the capsule... Which reminds me...)
(Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?)
Edgeworth, did those three people have a bag with them for transporting the capsule?
Oh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all.
Well, I guess that's about it for this room.
There are still a lot of gaps in the evidence, but I'll pull it off somehow! After all... ...you asked me to prove Blackquill's innocence, right, Edgeworth?
Yup. He called it a "special request." He reached out to me while I was still disbarred.
...Yup, the Blackquill case.
Hey, I'm not even a lawyer anymore, remember? Haven't been one for a long time.
!
Aww, just when I'm beginning to actually like the job I have now...
Hey, no need to apologize. It's like I said on the phone the other day... ...I know that the type of criminals you're after now aren't small fries anymore.
It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Yeah... It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end.
I'm going to end the dark age of the law. That's what this is all about.
That's right. He's talking about my case and Prosecutor Blackquill's.
It's such a shame... Once suspicion forms, it's very hard to shake. Lawyers and prosecutors were supposed to trust each other -- pursue the truth together.
Yes, and do absolutely anything to win. We're in an age now where winning is valued far more than the truth. I'm sure it's caused our new chief prosecutor to lose many a night's rest. (Is it just me or did his brow get even more furrowed than the last time I saw him...?)
*sigh* It sure is.
Well, somebody who mistrusts the court system and can manipulate robots... ...It can really only be Aura Blackquill. Who else but her would want a retrial of that case from seven years ago so badly?
(Actually, I think she had a much more horrific plan in mind for Athena...)
And I'll be counting on you in court to help me, too.
Yeah, but I'd like you to tell the hostage-taker something for me. I have to go to the Detention Center. I can't start the trial until I've talked to Athena.
(So I'm still being watched, huh?) I'll see you in court, Edgeworth.
(She was right by my side only a few short hours ago... ...but I feel like I haven't seen her in ages...)
And because you're my friend and I was worried about you.
I'm not the only one who's worried, either.
I saw Ms. Woods today. She was so beside herself, she came to find me. She told me you used to live in the Cosmos Space Center. No wonder you knew so much about the place!
That's all right. But... there are some other things I'd like to ask you.
Trucy... I still can't believe it...
Yeah... I'm sure she's hanging in there. (But if anything were to happen to her...) S-She's counting on us, Pearls, so let's get out there and do what we can!
That wasn't the robot talking. It was the hostage-taker speaking through him.
No, it's not like that, Pearls.
How can I explain it? It's kind of like a telephone.
Yes... No... Hold on. Now I'M confused!
Tell me about the day Clay was murdered.
(Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...)
Yeah, the director couldn't very well switch the pads if there were people in there...
Did you want to see that HAT-1 group photo, the one with your mother in it?
(That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?)
Maybe you got confused and went the wrong way when you were trying to leave?
No memory, huh...? (This is gonna be tough...)
I think that's enough of that, Athena. Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?)
What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing?
No need to apologize. (I guess her home life was... complicated...) Oh, by the way. Ms. Woods said something about you always wearing headphones...?
Okay... But let me say this one thing. I don't think your mother only thought of you as some handy subject for her research.
I'm sure of it. I'm really sure she did. (Because that's what I want to believe, too.)
(I'd better ask her a little more about her mother's research. I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.)
On a different subject... Did you hear about the person holding up the Space Center?
(I guess I'd better spare her the news about Trucy...) Well... ...after some negotiating, we agreed to do a retrial of the case from seven years ago.
Yup. I know he's innocent. I just have to prove it. So, wait. Did you know him back then?
(Unlike now, where he's more twisted than a basket of snakes...)
(She heard... the voice of his heart...)
Pearls is right. You did the very best you could at the time.
(It doesn't seem like Athena knows... ...that Prosecutor Blackquill is due to be executed tomorrow.)
(Come to think of it, she said something like that during the Themis Legal Academy trial. She mentioned there was somebody she wanted to save... She must've been talking about Prosecutor Blackquill...)
............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?!) ...He was doing well. He was happy about the possibility of being proven innocent.
(If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me... I just have to free him! Failure is not an option here!)
You seem to really love Ponco and Clonco.
It looks like there's something written on the bandages.
(A little girl who grew up around robots... She seems to have some good memories of it.)
Of course you didn't! We all believe in you.
Don't talk like that, Athena! We're going to clear you of all suspicion. Just you wait!
W-We are? What is it?
My phone! ...It's from Trucy!
No! Wait! We still have a little more time! Besides... all of the courtrooms are being used right now!
NO! Don't you dare hurt her! (There has to be something I can do!)
(Wait a minute... Maya...?)
(A courtroom... blew up...! That's it! There IS a courtroom we can use after all!)

Aura, please don't add to the crimes you've already committed.
We're ready to start the trial. We can hold it in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4, the one blown up by the bomber.
(I didn't exactly pick the place for its "astonishing" factor...) How about it? Are you ready to have your brother's innocence proven?
What? (Not... Prosecutor Blackquill...?)
(WH-WHAAAT?!)
! No way... It can't be true!
I see... I see five black Psyche-Locks! (I've seen these kinds of locks before... Dark, black locks protecting a secret deep inside a person's heart...
You did? That's great! I really appreciate it.
Yup. That's exactly how I got the truth out of Detective Fulbright and Director Cosmos.
So even they don't know it's there...
Okay, so all I have to do is break the Psyche-Locks!
(In other words, if I'm not careful, I could traumatize Athena for good... *gulp*) Pearls, could you stay by Athena's side? She must be suffering under the weight of such a heavy burden.
I'm up against Edgeworth. I have to be able to give this trial all of my focus and strength!
No, that's not it! I just meant I can relax and concentrate if I knew you were with Athena. You're the only one who can do it, Pearls.
(Good. Now that my mind is at ease, I'd better get ready. I'll just tidy up the evidence and take out what I don't need... It's time to end this nightmare that started seven years ago!)
(Defense, prosecution, and judge. There are even people in the gallery. The roof has been completely blown off and the walls have collapsed... ...but today, this ruin is my battleground!)
Please try not to upset Ms. Blackquill... I'm begging you...
Edgeworth! Did you not hear what I said to His Honor?!
(Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...)
Then you better bring it.
Your Honor, the defense was born ready!
(This immense tension between us... It's like we're picking up right where we left off.)
But I have no intention of losing Ms. Cykes, either. She's a very promising young lawyer! (I know without a doubt that Athena is innocent... ...but I don't think Prosecutor Blackquill did it, either.)
So... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...?
(The true culprit is a spy. It's going to be hard to convince anyone of that when I barely believe it myself... ...but I don't a choice if I want to save Athena and Blackquill and expose the spy!)
(So he wasn't doing them just out of fear... Interesting...)
(Athena's mother...)
(As skilled as ever at playing the court puppeteer, I see.)
(New testimony...? And just who IS this witness, anyway?)
What are YOU doing here...?
(That doesn't seem to stop her from constantly chiming in through Clonco...)
(I vaguely remember seeing three cases, all different sizes.)
(I can see why that footage helped to bring his trial to a quick end. It's very convincing, that's for sure...)
Speaking of after the incident, where was the defendant, Athena Cykes, found?
So what you're saying is, Ms. Cykes didn't have an alibi?
(I don't like where this is heading... Not one bit!)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

So Prosecutor Blackquill willingly accepted a death sentence to protect someone else?
But Athena Cykes certainly didn't kill anyone, either, Mr. Edgeworth.

But that's just speculation!

Then why didn't you say so in the first place?!
Fine, so maybe I jumped the gun by a teeny-weeny bit...

This rolling case... I suppose you mean the one... ...that existed in the photo with Prosecutor Blackquill in it... ...but was absent when the crime scene photos were taken?

And how do you propose he hid a person inside any of those cases?!
Oh, yeah... (Way to ruin the memory of a good day!)
Uh, m-my apologies. I'll invite you both next time. I promise. (So... Wait a minute. What were we talking about again?)

But that's nothing more than conjecture, and it's hardly the only possibility!
I think it was... the moon rock...

Be that as it may, it doesn't prove Ms. Cykes was inside!
(Yikes. Give a guy some time to think... Let's see... Should I try to bluff my way through what could have been in that case?)
(I guess I'd better wait and see how it goes.)
(It's a clever theory, but it doesn't look like they have any solid proof. If I push, maybe I can uncover some flaws in it.)
I know exactly what Prosecutor Blackquill carried from the scene. (I just have to find something else that was missing, right? No sweat!)
This is a crime scene photo taken after Prosecutor Blackquill left, correct? All we have to do is compare this with... ...this photo of Prosecutor Blackquill to see what's missing. If he took something with him, then it should be in one of these photos! (Lady Luck, don't fail me now...)


He took this!
............ (He saw straight through that!)
(I'd better compare the two photos again. Okay, in this photo, I see... ...the operating table, the katana, a cart... and the stuff on said cart... Are any of those things different in this photo taken after the incident?)
Please note that there is a robot part on top of the cart in this photo. However, in this photo taken after the crime, the robot part is gone. In other words, this part is something that was taken from the scene of the crime!
(Is it really just an insignificant robot part? ............Speaking of which...)
(Stingy, stingy. What happened to the age of free previews?) *ahem* Your Honor, about this robot part... Doesn't it look like it could be an arm from that robot there?
(But was it really just the one arm that was in there? If it wasn't Athena in the case, then maybe...) I believe there was another robot at the scene that looks just like the one here. Your Honor, it is the defense's assertion that it was this other robot that was in the case!

I know for a fact that it is a robot arm. I can even tell which robot it belonged to, just by looking at it! With this information, we can investigate whether it was there at the time or not.
Not to worry, Your Honor. I still know next to nothing about machines. But I know this piece of evidence proves which robot the arm belonged to!


I-Is this conclusive enough for you?!
(Can't you be normal for once and simply say, "That's wrong!"?)
(Well, given the arm's distinctive feature, this is one conclusion that won't escape me!) I may not know my hard disk from my floppy drive...
The robot in this picture is named Ponco. But take a look at Ponco's arm. It was Ms. Cykes who bandaged it up that like.
The robot arm at the crime scene had the same bandaging wrapped around it. In other words, this robot arm could belong to none other than Ponco!
(They've got me there... So then, did Prosecutor Blackquill make Ponco fit into the case by...?)
Couldn't he have crunched Ponco up and compacted her a bit? You know, kind of like... ...when you suck the air out of those storage bags with a vaccum cleaner?
............On second thought, let's just scrap the whole idea and start over, okay?
Gah!
Of course Ponco would fit. All Prosecutor Blackquill had to do was dismantle her. Once taken apart, the robot could have easily fit inside that rolling case!

But what if it wasn't done on the table? What if the katana was used instead?
Yes, Your Honor. Ms. Blackquill, I'd like your opinion as a woman of science. Isn't it true that the katana could have been used to take the robot apart?!
Thank you for your expert opinion, Ms. Blackquill. Thanks to you, we now know... ...that the existence of the severed arm in this photo proves that Ponco was taken apart. In addition, since the rest of Ponco was not found at the scene, we can conclude that... ...the true meaning of this photo is very different from the original interpretation.
That's exactly what I mean. This photo does NOT capture the moment of the murder. It is instead a picture of the moment after the robot was sliced apart. The blood you see where the arm was cut off was transferred there by the bloody katana. Most likely, the rest of Ponco is scattered around Prosecutor Blackquill's feet...
Therefore, what was transported inside that case was not the defendant, but a robot! Ms. Cykes never was at the scene at the time of the murder!
(Yes! I'm finally making some progress! Hopefully, I've gotten at least one step closer... ...to proving both Athena and Prosecutor Blackquill innocent...)
(All right... What's going on here? It's never good when he plays things this straight...)

But Ponco and Ms. Cykes couldn't have both been inside that case!
(Edgeworth... He's been one step ahead of me this whole time!)
That's hardly evidence.
Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

But we've also shown that the robot was there at the scene as well!
(I don't really think that, no, but...) You can't say the possibility isn't there! Detective Fulbright, was the robot questioned at the time?
But, as it turned out, the robot was actually integrally related. Your Honor, the defense would like to call Ponco to the stand!
(You're the last person who should be calling anybody "inflexible"...)
(This is great! I just KNEW Ponco must've seen something important!)
(The judge seems ready to adopt Ponco as another grandchild...)
...What?
WH-AAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
D-Don't be ridiculous! A cross-examination is never useless!
Nevertheless... I will have my cross-examination!
(I'll show you both just how fruitful any cross-examination can be!)

Your "regular recharge"? What is that, exactly?

("Hugged" her, huh? Which Edgeworth took to mean "stabbed her with a weapon.") You said the two of them were talking before Ms. Cykes hugged her mother, is that right?
Couldn't tell? Even though they were talking so loudly?
(Well, that explains why some of Ponco's testimony is so vague...)

(I don't want to delve too deeply here, but...) Could you tell us how the victim appeared and acted at this moment?
Her heart...?
(Now that he mentions it, I do remember reading something like that there... They detect the presence of people by the sound of their heartbeats. But wait a minute... That means... ...if Dr. Cykes really did die at this moment...) Ponco, how was Dr. Cykes after she fell down? Could you still hear the sound of her heartbeat?
Of all the unlucky timing! If you had heard anything after that... ...it could have possibly proved that the hug wasn't actually the moment of the murder!
Ngh...
(The workbench, huh...? Ponco must be talking about that table to the right of where that giant robot is now.)
(Is there something critical in Ponco's statement just now?)
Your Honor, I believe this statement is critical. I'd like it added to her testimony!
............ (Nothing particularly important, I guess.) So, what happened after that, Ponco?

Let's see... There are two round windows in the robotics lab. Which one did you mean?
(Okay, in the pictures of the crime scene from seven years ago, there is definitely... ...a hanging scroll and a Japanese theater mask hanging on the workbench-side wall. But is there some problem with this statement...?)


Prosecutor Blackquill? I wonder what he went there for?
(Hmm... I guess I can't very well ask Ponco to speculate...) So what happened after Prosecutor Blackquill arrived?

You don't remember what happened next? (Hmm... An "error," huh? I wonder if...)
Exactly. We can conclude that... ...Ponco's "error" was the result of her being dismantled.
(Yes, that's basically what Ms. Blackquill explained to us, too. She said their hearts and memories are stored on a separate computer.)
(There are a few parts of Ponco's testimony that are hard to interpret. Edgeworth chose to interpret "hugged" as "stabbed"... ...but I'd better try to iron out who did what where and to whom for myself... Hold on, Athena! I'm going to save you!)
Ponco, your statement may have just inspired a breakthrough.
Just to be sure, let's go over it again, okay? The victim fell near the window on the workbench side of the room. However... ...her body was discovered on the operating table.
Exactly, Your Honor! We've just learned a new, crucial fact! What could explain the two very different locations of the body? I'll tell you what!
The fact that the body was observed in two very different locations... ...indicates that the defendant moved the body!
Huh...? OH! (He's right! A little kid couldn't possibly move an adult body like that! And the last thing I want to do is cast more suspicion Athena's way!)
Um, can you just forget I ever said that, Your Honor? Please...?
Aaaaaagh! (Ngh... I really need to think this through. What could explain the two locations...?) Let me try that again, Your Honor!
An eleven-year-old girl couldn't have moved the heavy body of an adult. So the only explanation is that the victim walked to the operating table herself. In other words, what Ponco observed near the workbench... ...couldn't possibly have been the moment of the murder!
Yes, as we just heard in the testimony, Ms. Cykes hugged her mother, nothing more.
(Hey, blue's my favorite color! What can I say?)
Moved for her? But Ms. Cykes and Dr. Cykes were the only ones there!
Athena asked you to...?
(Hmm... That paper in the lab did mention something about that. "Recognizes people by scanning their spacesuit or uniform jacket ID tag," it said.)
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Ponco! Did you really move Dr. Cykes's body?! This is really important! Isn't there any way you could tell?!

But Ponco is equipped with a facial recognition system! If she really did move the victim, she would have recognized the body as Dr. Cykes! But she didn't, so that means--
Nnnnnnngh! (He's right...)
Wh-What? You can't possibly have an explanation!
Y-You can't possibly be suggesting...!
But take a look at Ponco's arm. It was Ms. Cykes who bandaged it up that like.
No way... I refuse to believe it!

NO! Don't say another word! Just stop!
That... That can't be... TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEE!
Edgeworth... She was just a little kid... How can you say such a horrible thing...?

B-But dismantling isn't the table's only function! It can make repairs as well! It's conceivable that Ms. Cykes moved her mother to the table in order to "fix" her!
What do you mean?
B-But...
This just can't be true...
Evidence... Right... Let's see... (I can't think of any!) I-I'm afraid I... don't have any evidence.
(Edgeworth's argument seems solid enough... But... But... There's no way Athena could have ever done anything like that! What do I do?! There has to be something... but I can't think of a single thing...!)
G-Go on. We're listening. (Could this be the miracle I need?! But what is Prosecutor Blackquill trying to pull here...?)
(This is awful... What he's saying seems to make sense, and yet...)
(Prosecutor Blackquill's execution is tomorrow... If the truth doesn't come out now, it's all over...)
M-Ms. Blackquill!
(Is this really happening? Is it really going to end just like it did seven years ago...?!)
............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?! If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me...)
(I can't let this happen...! ...But I just don't have the evidence to counter Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony...!)
Athena! What are you--? Are you feeling okay?
(If he really is, I could sure use Athena's help here... Her power might be just the thing to get us through this!)
(And yet, you found a way to keep your fears at bay and became a lawyer...)
(Athena is being so brave, confronting her past like this... This might really be the last chance to save them both!) Prosecutor Blackquill! Please testify one more time about the incident seven years ago!

Oh, I don't know about that. We've got a couple of strong wills on our side, too! Prosecutor Blackquill isn't the killer, and we're going to prove it!
This feeling of happiness... Even though the person you were looking for wasn't there, you felt happy. Why is that?
Just now, you said that you went to the Space Center to kill Dr. Cykes... ...but the first thing you did was look for her daughter instead?
Gah...! (The second I find an inconsistency, he cuts it down...)
(I was afraid of that. We'll just have to keep chipping away at him, then, bit by bit!) Could you update his testimony, Athena?

Thanks. That should help a lot. (If Prosecutor Blackquill isn't the killer, then there should be a contradiction somewhere!)
Not even you can falsify your emotions, Prosecutor Blackquill.
When you said that you killed Dr. Cykes in your testimony, you felt sadness. Why would someone who had laid in wait to kill her be sad at her death?!
Gah...! (He can't be talking about that... can he?)
(Wh-What...?!)
(So that's why he was relieved when he saw Athena... But is this story really true? I'm not sure how much to believe...)
How are you doing, Athena? Still hanging in there?
It went up? (I've never seen it do that before!)
(How in the world should I approach this? I can either use an evidence-based approach if I can find a contradiction. Otherwise, I should look for an inconsistency in his emotions...)

I don't think so. Not while I'm around. (Now, contradictory testimony or inconsistent emotions... Which should I tackle first?)
Okay, let's present some evidence here!
Okay, let's look for inconsistent emotions!
(Hmm... Is there really a contradiction in his testimony, though...?)
Okay, maybe we'd better look for inconsistent emotions now.
Let's just keep looking for inconsistencies in his testimony!

(Hmm... Is there really an inconsistency in his emotions, though...?)
Okay, let's compare the testimony with the evidence one more time!
I still think I can find an inconsistency in his emotions. Let's press on.
How odd. Why would you register surprise at opening the door to the lab?
So Dr. Cykes had Ponco do it?
(It's at 100 percent now! What's going on here?)
(It's pretty hard to keep telling coherent lies like that. His mind and his will really are as sharp and strong as a katana! All right, what should I tackle first this time?)
I think there might be an inconsistency in Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony!


Prosecutor Blackquill, your statement is inconsistent with this evidence.
Gah... (All right [sic], what should I tackle first this time?)
I think there might be an inconsistency in Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony!
(Hmm... Is there really a contradiction in his testimony, though...?)
Let's just keep looking for inconsistencies in his testimony!
(Hmm... Is there really an inconsistency in his emotions, though...?)
I think I'll keep trying to find something in his emotions.
Compounding lies with more lies is never the answer, Prosecutor Blackquill. Take a look at this photo.
The ironic thing is, I think this picture is actually going to be your savior now. See the bloodstain at the end of Ponco's arm where it was severed with the katana?
No. Most likely, the blood was transferred there from the bloody katana.
That's right. But, if that's the case, we've found a glaring inconsistency.
You said in your testimony that you cut up Ponco, and then you killed Dr. Cykes. But, in spite of that, the victim's blood is already on Ponco's arm in this picture.
Exactly. In order for the blood to have transferred from the sword to Ponco's arm... ...the victim must have been stabbed first, before the robot was slashed. In other words, Prosecutor Blackquill... ...your entire testimony is nothing but one giant ball of lies!
Tell the court the truth, Prosecutor Blackquill. Now!
Prosecutor Blackquill, you are on the witness stand. You are obligated to tell the truth. Isn't that the rule of the courtroom?

And the root of it all is hidden somewhere in this testimony, isn't it?
When you opened the door and saw Athena, you became overwhelmed by your emotions. Isn't that right, Prosecutor?
Prosecutor Blackquill, Ms. Cykes is innocent. I will always believe that with all my heart. Now, can't you find it within yourself to believe in me, too?
I give you my word. Now tell me what you really saw when you opened that door!
(N-No... Prosecutor Blackquill finally tells the truth... and THIS is what it is...? It's... beyond devastating...!)
A-Athena!

No! Not yet! It can't end like this!
I'm not... But this...! (I-I can't give up now! I have to say something, anything, even if it's a bluff! I've always managed to pull through that way in the past! I have to make it work!) The defense is, uh, prepared to... present evidence...
Y-Yes, Athena?
A-Athena! What are you saying?!
(Athena...!)

............I do, Your Honor.

Don't tell me you've forgotten one of the basic tenants of lawyering? Always believe in your client to the bitter end. Athena, you are not a murderer.
("Emotionalism"? Don't lecture ME on matters of the heart, Edgeworth! Because I can see straight into a person's soul!)
(There's still a chance. Somewhere deep in Athena's heart... ...there might still be a memory that not even she knows about yet. It might be like looking for a grain of sand somewhere in the cosmos, but, still...! That memory might contain a new fact that could prove her innocence!)
(There's definitely something wrong with her memory of the event. I can just tell!)


Well, sometimes you have to flip or tilt a thing to get a new way of looking at it, Your Honor.
(Ouch. That didn't work... Hmm... Athena said that the blood "flowed down the handle onto my fingers"... There's something about that that bothers me... I'd better look at the evidence again.)
I respectfully and vehemently disagree, Your Honor!
That's exactly my point. If blood really did get on your fingers while you were holding it... ...there should be blood on the handle. But please focus on the handle of this sword. There's not a trace of blood on it. And therefore... this is clearly a contradiction of the facts!

But she also said, "There's no question I remember it," -- a fact we can't ignore!
G-Gladly! (Just give me a sec to think of something... I want to say that Athena didn't stab anyone... ...but she said it herself that she remembers the feeling of committing the act... Think, Phoenix. Think! What could the contradiction with Athena's memories mean?)
The blood was wiped off of the handle!
(Uh-oh. I got the "hmph" treatment...)
I-I knew that...
Y-Yes, Daddy...
Ms. Cykes said blood flowed down the handle, but the katana's handle is spotless. So, doesn't it follow that the defendant must have used a weapon other than the katana?
(This is it. This time, I've found just the thing to end Athena's nightmare for good! The weapon that took Dr. Cykes's life was the katana. That much is for sure. So if I can show a possibility that Athena didn't use the katana... ...it could help me prove her innocent!)
(Right. Of course he would ask that.)
(How does he do that? But I can't back down! Not here, not now!) That's right. I did. Because it's so obvious, it doesn't require any thought.
(Okay, so maybe that was an exaggeration, but there has to be something! Was there some other bladed weapon in the robotics lab that day? Maybe there's something in one of the crime scene photos... Wait a minute! There IS something! There is a high probability that THAT was in the lab! I don't have that particular weapon here in evidence right now, but... ...I DO have a piece of evidence just like it!) Other than the katana, this is another blade that may have been at the crime scene!


Well, when you put it that way... I'm not sure.
(That... wasn't... so... bad... Anyway! The crime scene was a robotics lab. They must have had blades of some kind! And I have something just like it in evidence!)
Yes. This is the knife that took Mr. Terran's life. But there must have been a knife just like this at the scene seven years ago as well. Tool kits containing utility knives like this one are issued to Space Center employees. And a robotics lab, especially, would naturally have one of these around.

O-Of course I knew that! (Once you told me just now...)
(Hmm... Fine, but isn't there something odd about the design on these handles...?)

I disagree. This tool kit contained a knife.
Don't tell me your eye for art is failing you, too, Mr. Edgeworth.
Notice that the handles of each of these tools have a sort of design on them.
It's clear that one of the tools is missing from this kit. If we rearrange the tools into a specific pattern... ...we might be able to tell which part of the overall design is missing.
(Edgeworth... Just let it go, man.)


Here it is!
That's right. Of course, you have to have an open mind. And squinting a little helps, too.
(Uh-oh. I got the "*sigh*" treatment...)
Yes, Your Honor! I'll be very serious next time! I promise! (These red and white markings... I know I've seen something like them before!)
The GYAXA logo, Your Honor. It's on all of the Space Center's documents and pamphlets. As you're aware, GYAXA is the program that operates the Cosmos Space Center.
GYAXA, huh? Isn't that the new name of the federal space R&D program?
Yes, with just the tools shown in this photo... ...the red "A" part of the logo is missing. And this is where the murder weapon from the Terran case comes into play. If we were to place the utility knife in the open slot... ...it would complete the GYAXA logo!
Admit it, Mr. Edgeworth. My aesthetic sense is keener than yours! And while you're at it... ...admit that the weapon Ms. Cykes used could have been this one!
Ms. Cykes confessed to having a memory of "stabbing the victim." Admittedly, Ms. Cykes most likely did stab someone... using the utility knife... However, the weapon used to kill Dr. Cykes was the katana. Therefore, the act of stabbing that Ms. Cykes remembers couldn't be that of Dr. Cykes!
...Come again?
Don't be ridiculous! Or are you changing the premise of your entire argument?!

Th-The prosecution is attempting to lead the court!
No...
I-I don't believe it...! Why?! Why does this keep happening?! Every time I find a contradicton, it vanishes and the suspicions keeps coming back! It's almost as if... almost as if...!
Ngh...! NGHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Ngaaagh! (I don't want to believe it... It can't be true...) Ngh...! (But what if...?!)
(Is giving up really the only option...?! No! Snap out of it, Phoenix! What's the matter with you, giving in to doubt?! I can't look back! Forward is the only way to go!) No, Your Honor, not yet! It isn't over yet!
(I can't lose sight of what's important! I believe in Athena, and I'll always believe in her... to the very end! A defense lawyer never gives up on his client! I have to pick myself up and stand firm! Make that brain of yours work, Phoenix! If I don't see a way, I'll just have to go back and look for one! Time to rethink this case, thoroughly!)
I concede the fact that Athena must have stabbed someone with the utility knife. This must've been what Ponco witnessed as Athena's "hug." But Prosecutor Blackquill didn't see the knife at the scene. This means that someone must've removed it from the lab before he arrived. Who could have taken the utility knife from the lab?
Maybe Dr. Cykes was still alive, and she's the one who took the utility knife away...? ............Nah. That's definitely not it.
But that's the prosecution's claim! And of course Athena didn't take the knife with her! What kind of lawyer doubts his own client?!
If I trust in Athena, then I have to conclude there was a third person at the scene. But according to Ponco's testimony, Athena and her mother were the only two there. So then, how did this third person manage to escape Ponco's detection? I know! This person must've fooled Ponco's facial recognition feature by covering...
Maybe the person covered Ponco's face so they wouldn't be recognized! But, no... In that case, Ponco wouldn't have recognized anybody, not even Athena...
No, that's not right. What good would covering the victim's face have done? Besides, that wouldn't have helped the culprit hide their identity.
But wait a minute. Ponco has a heartbeat detection system, too. Even if they covered their own face, Ponco would've still detected their presence. But she wouldn't have been able to tell who they were... Wait, that's it! The culprit could have covered their face and posed as which person to avoid detection?
What if the culprit covered their face and posed as Prosecutor Blackquill? ...But Ponco already said she recognized the real Blackquill... I guess two Prosecutor Blackquills isn't the answer... Back to the drawing board...
What if the culprit posed as Ponco? That way, the real Ponco would just think she was looking in a mirror! ...Okay, now that's just silly. Scratch that.
If the person posed as the victim... ...that would explain why Ponco thought only she and Athena were there. All they had to do was take advantage of Ponco's basic recognition features. The culprit used this in order to pose as the victim.
...But then why would the culprit have gone to the trouble of hiding their face?! Let's see... Ponco can also recognize people by scanning their ID tag, if I recall... In that case...
Ponco saw the culprit holding the victim's katana and thought it was her, maybe...? Nah. Let's see... Ponco can also recognize people by scanning their ID tag, if I recall... In that case...
The culprit could've posed as the victim by wearing her jacket with the ID tag on it! But that still leaves the heartbeat detection system. How did the culprit get around that? It wouldn't have worked if Ponco could detect the real Dr. Cykes's heartbeat, too. So does that mean that the real Dr. Cykes was already dead by that time? If that's the case, then who did Athena stab?
No, no, no. That's the one conclusion I DON'T want to come to. I'd better try again.
Athena stabbed herself? What am I thinking?! Get it together and try again, Phoenix!
Th-That's it...! The person Athena stabbed wasn't Dr. Cykes. It was the person who murdered her, and then pretended to be her... The real culprit!
............

I didn't say I was finished -- I was only pausing for a second. Because I realized something so shocking, I had to take a break to digest it. But now, I know for a fact that............ Ms. Cykes is innocent.
Yes, Ponco did witness something. She saw the "hug"... In other words, the moment you used the utility knife. But the person you stabbed wasn't your mother.
The answer is simple. The person Ms. Cykes stabbed... ...was a third person, posing as Dr. Cykes!

After all we've been through, Mr. Edgeworth, I'm disappointed. Don't you know by now that this smile of mine means I have absolute confidence?
(Clonco's strange "malfunction"...)
"Mr. Terran"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to...
(That was another case of mistaken identity cause by a jacket ID tag. All because Clonco couldn't read Apollo's facial features due to that eye patch.) Like Mr. Edgeworth said, a mask could nullify the robot's facial recognition. And then... ...all the person would have to do is wear a jacket with the victim's ID tag to pose as her!
I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth, but that doesn't count for much, I'm afraid. Because, by that time, Dr. Cykes's heart had already stopped beating.
Yes, Your Honor -- the person Ms. Cykes stabbed... ...this third person who was posing as Dr. Cykes... ...is her mother's real killer!
Athena...! Wh-What is it?!
(The black Psyche-Locks... They're breaking!)
(They're gone! The black Psyche-Locks are finally gone!) You didn't really stab your mother, did you. It's all right, Athena. Just tell us what you saw that day.
It's all right. I'm right here. You're safe, Athena.

Quiet, Your Honor! Go on, Athena.
And this time, you got him, didn't you?
(So that's why she said that...) Your Honor, as you can see, the defendant has just given us critical new testimony. A man was there before Ms. Cykes arrived! A man who covered the victim's face... ...and put on the victim's jacket! This man is the real culprit!
A few moments ago, Ms. Cykes mentioned a mask. Athena, can you tell us anything else about that?
(A ph-phantom...?)
Ms. Blackquill! (Th-This is not good...)
(Ungh... She's right. We don't have any hard evidence of the masked man's existence...)
Athena... I'm so glad for you.
I see where you're going with this. If "Mommy Metis" was really the killer in disguise...
(Do I have anything here in the evidence... ...that can help me find this person who came to the lab before 2 PM...?)


This piece of evidence will reveal the identity of the person who came to the lab!
Oh... um... How about if we team up for this, Mr. Edgeworth?
H-How about you, Your Honor? What do you say?
Owww! (Tag-teamed by Lemon Juice and Paper Cut... Could an image of the culprit.. ...possibly have been captured anywhere...?)
This is Prosecutor Blackquill leaving the scene after the incident, at around 3 PM. What I'm wondering is, does the video show anyone else passing by there before then?
Just as I thought. So if we rewind the footage and go back to around 2 PM... ...we should be able to see the true culprit leaving the scene!
There! Please stop it right there!
Ms. Cykes... do you remember this person?
(That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?)
Exactly. It proves that Ms. Cykes's memory was correct! Dr. Cykes's killer arrived at the robotics lab before 2 PM. He killed her and hid her face with a handkerchief. Then, he disguised himself with Dr. Cykes's jacket and mask that were there in the lab.
By leaving Dr. Cykes's jacket on, the culprit tricked Ponco into thinking he was Dr. Cykes. Thereby, making it look like she was alive up to that point in time. All to disguise the real time of death!
Wh-What?! Why not?! The victim's jacket is clearly visible right there in this video!
Hmm... (What's going on? That doesn't make sense... Edgeworth's right. If the culprit was wearing the jacket, how did it get back to the lab?)
Dr. Cykes must have brought it back to the lab herself.

Don't be ridiculous, Edgeworth! Everybody knows that's impossible!
Gaaaaaaagh! Your Honor, please give me another chance!
Ms. Cykes brought the jacket back to the lab!

I'll believe in Ms. Cykes [sic] complete innocence... to the bitter end!
Gaaaaaaagh! Your Honor, please give me another chance!
The killer used the jacket as a disguise to make his escape... ...but in order to conceal that fact, he had to get the jacket back to the crime scene. So the culprit simply returned to the robotics lab later and planted it there. Contradiction resolved!
(When did the culprit have the chance to bring the jacket back?)
The culprit was there at the time of the crime! He could have easily put it back then.
Of course I do! Who do you think you're dealing with here?
Why can't these hurt less?!
The only time the culprit could have returned the jacket was when the body was found.
I do. Most people, when they come across a murder, focus their attention on the body. The culprit could have taken advantage of that split second to plant the jacket. In other words, the true culprit of this case, the man known as "the phantom"... ...was one of the first people to discover the body!
Oh, you mean the shock-resistant bag?
Y-You will...?!
(I can't believe it! It's over! I won! I proved that both Athena and Prosecutor Blackquill are innocent!) Your Honor! I see no need to further prolong this trial!
(Ms. Blackquill...)
(...Did you really just go there, Your Honor?!)
Y-You do?!
Th-That's right. (The phantom... The person Blackquill has been looking for, even from behind bars!)
And that scientist was... Dr. Cykes!
(Wow, I bet he's never let that out of his sight all these years.)
And what about the results Dr. Cykes drew up for you? Was there any useful information?
I-I will... (I'd better hold onto this real tight...)
(No emotional fluctuation, huh?)
Yes, please, Your Honor! (It's over... It's finally over...)
Athena... You're more than welcome...
A-Apollo!
(Why, Apollo? Why would you do this to us?)
What are you talking about?! The case from seven years ago has been settled!
(What in the world is Apollo trying to do?)
(Not you too, Edgeworth... I really hope it's because you have something up your sleeve.)
Yes, Your Honor. (I'd better rearrange my evidence...)
(I don't get it! Just what did you find out over the past few days to make you think this...?)

What first made you suspicious of Ms. Cykes?
(Poor Apollo must've been beside himself during that investigation...)
(So that's why Apollo was acting so strangely...) But the reason Ms. Cykes unconsciously reacted to the knife is because... ...she stabbed her mother's murderer with one identical to it seven years ago.
Ungh... (I guess he has a point...)

That's the lighter found in the Space Museum with her fingerprints on it, right? But even if it seems decisive, there must be other facts we don't know about it yet!
But, Mr. Justice! Ms. Cykes had absolutely no motive to kill Mr. Terran!
(I still can't believe this... How can you actually suspect Athena, Apollo?)

Isn't it possible that somebody else used that same escape route?
Why not?
A camera in Boarding Lounge 2? (First I've heard of it, but it makes sense... Athena said she had snuck into the Space Museum the night before the incident... ...and then was overcome and passed out until around noon the next day.)
(That must've been when the camera captured her. And that's what made Apollo suspect her even more... But wait a minute...) In that case, it most likely recorded the true culprit as well.
WHAT?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!
(That can't be! But if it is, then it is incredibly incriminating...)
(Nghhh...)

Believing in your client to the end is a basic principle of good defense. Shouldn't you extend that same principle to your own co-worker?
(Apollo suspected his trusted co-worker of killing his friend. To dispel his doubts, he investigated on his own, but that only led to more doubts. Apollo must've been really struggling with this... Well, Apollo may have doubts, but...) ...I'll say it again. Athena Cykes isn't the murderer.
(His points of contention are the fingerprints on the lighter, and the escape route, huh? Apollo knows how I operate, so I can't use my usual tactics on him. It looks like the only thing I can do here is press him for more information.)
............
(IS that what you think, Phoenix? Was there an alternative escape route?)
(I don't THINK there was an alternative route, but if I say that, it's all over. I'd better think this through again.)
Yes, of course there must have been. (Just don't ask me what...)
Me? Bluff? No way! (............He knows me too well.)
............Wait! So is that what this is all about?!
I believe you're right.
While we lawyers believe in and defend our clients to the end.
(That's so like Apollo, always uber-earnest about things like this...) Mr. Justice... I vow to dispel every last bit of doubt in your heart!
(You're really hoping there WAS an alternative route, aren't you, Apollo? But if I use the process of elimination, there really aren't that many possibilities. Director Cosmos was at the southern exit... ...leaving only the Control Room and the corridor to the Space Museum. Which door could the culprit have escaped through?)


But can you really say with certainty that it isn't possible?
...I guess you're right.
They really only could've escaped to the corridor to the Space Museum. All they had to do was use the unconscious Mr. Starbuck's prints to get through the door.
Ungh...
But Ms. Cykes was the only person... ...captured by the Boarding Lounge 2 security camera.
(What could the answer be? Was there really no other escape route? ............But, hold on a second. What if...? Where did those mysterious leaves we saw in the corridor come from? What if they're a clue to the culprit's real escape route...?) ............I think it IS possible that the culprit escaped into the Space Museum... ...but then came out using a route other than into Boarding Lounge 2.
Launch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... ...the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!


What?
Gah... (Well, I think I have a beautiful mind...!)
(Launch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!) Please let me try that again!
We found something odd while investigating the Museum corridor this afternoon. Namely, a few dead leaves on the floor. Considering where dead leaves come from... they point us to exactly where the culprit escaped to.
Yup. While the Space Museum was in motion, just beyond that corridor's safety door... ...was an alternative place that the culprit could use to escape. In other words, the culprit's real escape route was... ...the area outside the Space Center!

Ordinarily, yes. But after the bombing incident, the culprit could make use of a certain item.
All right. This is what the culprit used to leap to the outside wall of the main building.


Um, what?
Well, uh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
There was an emergency ladder in the fourth-floor robotics lab. And it was used that day after the explosions to help evacuate people. Ms. Blackquill herself used that ladder to escape down to ground level. Recall that the launch pads were switched after the ladder was lowered. The corridor would have passed by the ladder while the pads were being switched. And that's when the culprit literally sprang into action! And leapt onto the ladder!
All right, then. Name one.
T-Twenty feet? You're pulling my leg, right?
Urk.

B-But the culprit had just murdered someone. They weren't in an ordinary state of mind.

Because there was a security camera in Boarding Lounge 2. The culprit knew they would be recorded if they left the Space Museum that way!
That's a good point!
That's.... also a good point...
Stop bringing up good points, Edgeworth...
Why do you always have to point out every flaw?!?!?!
(But everyone feels fear on some leve, right? ............Wait a minute! Aha! I've got it this time!) I can prove that there is someone who could've used this alternate escape route!
This proves the possibility of a person who could've used this alternative escape route!


This should clear everything up!

Yes, it does! It even suggests the possilibility of a third or fourth escape route!
Gah! (That didn't work... Didn't I have some evidence that proves the existence of somebody without fear...?)
This is a certain person's very interesting psych profile. "The subject... doesn't experience feelings like normal people do." In other words, this person doesn't feel happiness, sadness, or fear.
Without the constraint of fear... ...he could easily do what an ordinary person wouldn't dare! Just as you or I could do a broad jump on the ground without the slightest fear... ...this "subject" could make a twenty-foot leap, fifty feet up in the air. He could choose this extreme way of escaping without hesitation!
Yes, the phantom, that mysterious, shadowy figure who keeps popping up...
I knew the phantom was there behind the scenes of the Space Center bombing. But I wasn't sure if he was connected to the murder of Clay Terran as well. However, now it's all clear! The phantom is the one who not only bombed the Space Center, but also killed Mr. Terran!
There were just too many similarities between this case and the one from seven years ago. "But why?" you may ask. It can only be because both incidents are the work of the same phantom!
(This phantom has been haunting this case, pulling the strings in the background... Who could this unidentified, international spy be?)
Yes, I think you're right. ............But it doesn't explain this one last thing.
The robotics lab wasn't the only room with an emergency ladder. But he couldn't have made that leap unless he was certain which one it would be.
That's right.
............Wait a minute...
Ms. Blackquill lowered the ladder... after being told to by the detective leading the...? ............AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Y-You've gotta be kidding me!)
Yes, I do...
(Our mystery spy, known as the phantom, is none other than...!)

That's right. We were all completely fooled!
But I don't, Your Honor! And I'll prove it! (After the explosions, somebody gave the order to lower that emergency ladder. That person is the phantom!) I promise to reveal who the phantom is this time, Your Honor!
As for the detective who was leading the evacuation from the fourth floor... ...he had a very specific objective in mind.
His objective was to secure his own escape route!
This is a detective you all know. He's even the lead detective on the current case... He appears to be a very emotional man, but his psych profile says he is without emotion.
Exactly. We were all taken in by his fake persona. Detective Fulbright's real identity is the phantom!
That's easy, Your Honor. Detective Fulbright was leading the fourth floor evacuation effort. Our first clue is that he made no attempt to have any other ladder put to use. The ladder in the robotics lab is the only one he ordered to be lowered. The second is that he directed everybody to the basement shelter via this ladder.
After Detective Fulbright saw to it that the ladder was lowered from the robotics lab... ...he went to the lounge, where he killed Clay Terran, and escaped into the Space Museum. The Museum started moving, slowly, so he waited for the right time, got a running start... And just as the corridor was passing the ladder... he leaped onto it!
Your Honor, the defense demands to question Detective Bobby Fulbright!
Don't thank me yet. We still have an uphill battle to fight.
(Ugh... Well, this is awkward...)
(You didn't have any trouble slapping him a second ago...)
(Guess I know now who to call if I ever get sleepy in court...)
...Edgeworth. Yeah. I think they're pretty great, myself. (And they're not afraid to keep me in line...)
Trucy and all the others...?! Oh, thank goodness!!!
I wonder what it is? Ms. Blackquill!
(She'd better not be here to complain about something...)
(So I guess that means she's starting to trust US at least...)
(I guess love can take on a variety of expressions, including stunted in their case...)
(What Ms. Blackquill did was inexcusable... ...but it's clear she did it out of love for her brother...)
(I don't have to be able to read his heart to see how happy he is...)
(It's okay to cry, Athena. I promise.)
What are you talking about, Apollo? You're coming to the defense's bench with me.
Well, I can't expect Athena to assist me, now can I? She's the defendant. That leaves you, Apollo.
Well, our office is pretty short-handed, and you're all I've got.
So, you won't be needing that eyepatch anymore, right?
Now THIS is the Apollo I know!
Yup.
Sounds great, Edgeworth. Thanks.
Okay, you two all set to go?
(This is it, the final battle! The murder of Apollo's friend, the courtroom bombing incident... ...and the case that ushered in the dark age of the law seven years ago... Destiny has called us to bring the one responsible for it all to justice today!)
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Not that you mention it... (Although, back then, I thought you were more loud than you were reliable...) You've really come a long way since then, Apollo. You've grown a lot.
(He's still got that ego of his, though.)
Seven years of grumpiness doesn't go away so easily, I guess.

You can't fool us with that act anymore! Your "justice" is nothing but lies!
Tell me about it. He must be feeling awfully confident...
...Let's just try not to lose focus, all right?
Well, Fulbright was his partner after all.
That's fine, Your Honor.

The "embodiment of justice"?! Those are just empty words!
All right, all right. Let's just move on.

My arguments are hardly "far-fetched"! There's careful reasoning behind my theory!
Yes, that's true, but... (But wait... Detective Fulbright was the one who brought that evidence to the trial...)
(He's right. But what exactly should I ask about...?)
(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)
So, how many prints were found exactly?
Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it--
(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)
Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter.
Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way.
I believe this is important. Please swap this statement into your testimony!
Could you please add that statement to your testimony?

Then please tell us more about the circumstances surrounding the ladder.
(Let's see. What should I ask about?)
(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)
Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time.
(Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.)
(Um, why don't you let me decide that...?)
(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)
Please tell us anything you remember about the lab.
(Yeah, that's pretty much how it looked when we visited this afternoon, too.)
What? No, um..
What? No, um..

You mean the lighter that was found in the Space Museum, is that right?
(Without evidence I should probably save this fight for another time...)

So three prints from a right hand were found on the lighter, huh? Are you certain of this?
Why would you say that?
Hey, great point! (Why didn't I catch that one?) Detective Fulbright! I'm sure you heard our discussion just now. About how Ms. Cykes always wears a glove on her right hand!
............I guess we don't.
(Like I need a lecture from you, Smiles McGoo... Hmm... Should I try asking him about something else?)
Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter.
Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way. I believe this is important. Please swap this statement into your testimony!
Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?


Yes, Ms. Blackquill did mention she saw a lit lighter being held up.
(Ugh... This line of questioning is going to get me anywhere except Convictionland... Hmm... should I try asking him something else?)
So, how many prints were found exactly?
Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it--
Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?

I'm beginning to wonder, is Ms. Blackquill ever NOT crabby?
(Hmm. Should I try asking the detective something else?)
Please tell us anything you remember about the lab.
(Yeah, that's pretty much how it looked when we visited this afternoon, too.)
What? No, um...
Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?

You aren't fooling anyone! You chose the ladder in that very room on purpose to create your escape route!
(Huh? Did I mess up somewhere along the way?)
Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time.
(Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.)
(Um, why don't you let me decide that...?)
Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?
Well, at least he seems willing to answer our questions. Let's keep asking about different things and see if we can uncover an inconsistency. (Detective Fulbright is a tougher adversary than I'd thought...)
Ugh... And it doesn't help that he has the evidence...
You say the prints were from a right hand, is that correct?!
But that just doesn't add up.
According to Ms. Blackquill, who saw the culprit herself... ...this person held the lighter in their left hand.
So here is the dilemma before us: Why are the prints on the lighter from a right hand instead of a left?!
Your Honor, this lighter can hardly be called incriminating evidence! The witness's CLAIMS don't even hold water!
I believe so... ...if you mean the little window in the back and to the right of the room.
Hmm... I do remember seeing it... ............Aaaah! So are you saying...?!

But your argument is only conjecture! You don't have any proof that what Ms. Blackquill saw was a reflection--
Huh?
And why not?
...You're right. There's no emblem on the other side.
Uh oh...
Noooooooooooooooooooooo! (Come baaack, my beautiful contradiction!)
He's tough! He's managed to discredit almost everything I've proven up this point...
You mean...?
We have Prosecutor Blackquill's reluctant blessing, apparently. Okay, Apollo, you're up!
I hope so. Now, let's check every inch of this thing.
I don't think looking at each print with the naked eye will tell us anything new. But this lighter definitely hides a secret...
Ugh... The back is covered with blood.
You're right. It suddenly breaks off unnaturally.
You're right. There's definitely something off here.
I don't see anything unusual about the top of the lid.
There's a moon here in relief.
I don't see anything add about this, though.
So this is the Earth emblem Detective Fulbright was talking about.
...Huh? H-Hey! Look at this! The emblem's actually some kind of button!
A handle, a trigger. Is this what I think it is...?
A gun............ So that's it. Your Honor, please recall this morning's trial, when Director Cosmos was on the stand. The bullet that hit the oxygen tank was extremely small, maybe a .10 caliber. This little compact gun probably takes bullets of that caliber.
So when Detective Fulbright would touch his holster...
Calm down, Apollo. He's just saying that because he has to as the prosecutor.
Sounds like you've hit on something, Apollo.
You mean, you think this lighter might be forged evidence?!
...I can definitely think of a few things.
(If we assume he's been laying a big trap for us all along... There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence. What's wrong with the lighter as a piece of evidence?)
(No, I guess I don't see anything strange about how the prints were left on the lighter... Nothing unusual about the angle of the prints or how they are patchy in places, but...)
(Anything odd about where the prints are? No, I guess if it was fired as a gun... ...that's about where the prints would be, but...)
(Are they really Athena's fingerprints? They defintely matched her print data... Hmm... But what about the data itself...?) Detective Fulbright, you were the one who provided us with the lighter and print data... ...isn't that correct?
You say Ms. Cykes's prints matched the print data... ...but I have to wonder, was the data you used official?
I guess there's only one way to find out. Let's re-examine the prints... ...using the official, sanctioned print data of the people involved in this case.
And the results?
Yes!
By your own admission, you were also the one who compiled the phony print data. All to put the blame on Ms. Cykes!
This ploy must've been to distract us from the phantom who was behind everything. You were out to create the impression that the phantom wasn't the true culprit.
Remember the killer's escape route. No ordinary person... ...would have been fearless enough to attempt it. Nobody but the phantom -- the man with no emotions -- could've done it.
Detective Fulbright, you were the only one who could've used that escape route.

You're telling us this NOW?! But if what you say is true, then... ...who was the mystery person Ms. Blackquill and Mr. Starbuck saw?
(Just two seconds ago, Fulbright was treating Athena like a criminal... Does he really think he's going to lie his way out of it now?)
(He's right! After we've come all this way, we can't let Fulbright wriggle free now!)
What?! How can you say that, Prosecutor Blackquill?! It's obvious he's the phantom!
Ngah.
B-But...!
(Please tell me Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't REALLY been taken in by this big phony?!)
I know! I know! But...! (Argh! What do I do?! I don't have any proof that Detective Fulbright is the phantom! Is this it...? Is he going to get away just like that...?)
Athena, what are you doing?! (Hope we don't get held in contempt of court!)
Athena, where are you going with these questions?
What? Does that mean...?!
That's it! With your special ability, we just might be able to stop him!
Wh-What's going on here?
Huh? Mind filling me in here?
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! You two were working together just now?!
Even with all his over-the-top expressions and gestures, he's registering no emotion at all?!
Wait! Hold it! What do you think you're doing, Detective?
(More like, as a spy...)
(More like, "for us SPIES"... Seriously. But I wonder why he suddenly showed several strong emotions...? Wait a minute... I think I know!) I sense there's a feeling you're trying to hide with your exaggerated emotions, Detective.

What the--?! How are we supposed to pick out what's unnatural from this mess?!
This must be his defenses against your ability.
Well, we know he's hiding something, and that he feels threatened by Athena. Being only human, his true feelings -- an emotion he can't completely conceal... ...must be hidden somewhere in his testimony!
I found it! I found the one emotion you're truly feeling!
Hidden in the middle of that chaotic storm, I saw one emotion that never disappeared. When you talked about the moon rock... ...you felt a fear that wouldn't fade!
Detective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...
You lost the precious moon rock you went to so much trouble to get, didn't you? And that frustration has turned into fear in your heart!
Yeah, I guess you're right... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?)
You tried but failed to steal the moon rock! That stain on your career as a spy has left you feeling afraid!
Don't everyone jump on the Phoenix hype train all at once now... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?)
...Of course! That's it!
Detective Fulbright, I think I know why you would feel afraid. You are afraid that the moon rock will somehow reveal your identity.
Apparently so. Wait a minute... Maybe the phantom didn't so much STEAL the moon rock... ...but more like he HAD to take it with him? Because there was something on it that would reveal his true identity!

Where do you think YOU'RE going?!
(How many more of those toys does he have? And where can I get myself some?) Detective Fulbright! You will answer honestly to this court right now! Why do you feel fear in connection with the moon rock?!
Aaaaagh! (And what was THAT just now?!)
(Uh-oh. He's got Athena doubting herself.) Ms. Cykes's analytical psychology has breathed new life into the courtroom. It has freed the hearts of many witnesses, and has been key in getting to the truth.
!
You and I, Prosecutor Blackquill... We have a duty to bring the phantom down, and restore the people's faith in the courts!
I bear part of the responsibility as well... ...for being suspected of forging evidence and losing my attorney's badge as a result. The two of us and the phantom were there at the beginning of the dark age of the law.

Once two people overcome their misgivings, that's where real trust is to be found. You're free to believe what you want, but... ...trust like that is stronger than you and your lies, always!

It only REMINDED you of the phantom?! Don't make me laugh. You ARE the phantom!
(Argh... I hate to admit it, but he's right.)

Your family? Like, who in your family, specifically?

You can't think of a single reason that the phantom might be afraid of the rock?
(The phantom, a person with very few emotions... ...would only be afraid of something really big. Like his cover getting blown big... I'm willing to bet that the moon rock has something to do with his identity, but what?)
True............ But maybe the "DNA" isn't too far off...
(Something unexpected happened to him during the incident seven years ago... I just KNOW I have something that can show why the phantom is afraid of the moon rock!)


And how afraid are you, exactly?
Do you shake when you see Ms. Cykes's earring?
(I guess some people just inspire THAT much fear in others...)
Ha ha ha! Of course not! (Must beef up mindreading defenses...)

After all that you've done, how dare you speak the word "justice"?!
(Grr! He won't get the best of me with that twisted argument of his! I'll find a way to get him right where I want him!)
Right. So that's why the phantom had to take the moon rock with him seven years ago. (In that case, if we had something to show the real cause of Fulbright's fear... ...we just might be able to expose his true identity!)
Detective Fulbright, I assume you know what this is.
That's right. And the exact same type of knife... ...Ms. Cykes used seven years ago when stabbed the phantom's hand.
And this time, you got him, didn't you?
Ms. Cykes then stated that she remembers the culprit bleeding. It's my theory that the culprit's blood got on the moon rock. And he was afraid that if the blood was analyzed, his true identity would be revealed. That explains why the phantom had to remove the moon rock from the crime scene!
That may be so, but I'm certain I can explain what happened to it in great detail.
Of course! (...Not.)
Aaaaagh! (What this court needs is a bully-free zone...)
Let's start with something that's been bothering me for a while. Now, the culprit supposedly removed the moon rock from the lab... ...but in this video of him, it's nowhere to be seen.
But here's something to consider. What if the phantom hid the moon rock somewhere at the scene of the crime?
And why's that?
Ah! How could I forget about that?!
(There's no way it just disappeared! Logic and evidence tells us otherwise. The phantom didn't have the moon rock on him when he left the lab... ...yet, a thorough police search didn't turn up anything... ...and it never turned up in the seven years after that, either. The phantom made the rock disappear without physically removing it himself... But how? There must have been a way...! Think, Phoenix, think! How did the moon rock vanish from the robotics lab?!)
Yes, I can, Your Honor.


Yes, well, I thought it would be kind of cool if it was.
Gaaaaaaagh! (But what if I don't HAVE one?!)
(Off the face of the Earth...? Wait a minute! That's it!)
He couldn't carry the rock out, but he couldn't leave it in the Center to be found, either. So there was only one safe place to stash it. The Hope capsule that was there in the lab that day.
Exactly. The phantom got rid of the moon rock in the most "cosmic" way he knew how. It was out there in the depths of space... ...aboard the Hope space probe!
That's right. He planned for the moon rock to be turned into cosmic dust out in space... ...thereby destroying the one piece of evidence that could reveal his true identity! But Mr. Starbuck and the others foiled the phantom's plot.
The Hope space probe sailed off safely on its mission and returned seven years later... ...with the capsule in tow!
If we analyze the blood on the moon rock, it should make one thing crystal clear. That you were the phantom all along, Detective Fulbright!
I believe so. His original assignment may have been just to sabotage the HAT-2, but... ...at the same time, he also had to retrieve the evidence of his crimes seven years ago. That's why he went to the boarding lounge... ...and attacked Clay as he made his "escape" out of the rocket with the capsule. But, in the end, it was all he could do just to escape himself, so he didn't get the capsule.
It's game over for you, Detective Fulbright! Why don't you just admit to it all now?!

But in that case, you could say ANYTHING is a trap!
H-Hey! You guys aren't really...!
Edgeworth!
Did you find something out about the phantom's true identity?
(That's not good...)
Uh, oh...
Huh? Wh-What's that supposed to mean...?
............A-An IMPOSTER?!
What the...?!
(Wh-What's with this guy? ............Is he even still human?)
Oh, uh... huh?
I believe there was blood on the moon rock in that capsule. Now that we know you aren't even Bobby Fulbright... ...your claims of a phantom "trap" won't work anymore!
I think I will do just that! Get ready, because the Hope capsule is about to seal your... ............F...Fuuuuuuuuuuuudge!
A............ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
(I can't believe it... Have we really reached a dead end after coming all this way?! Has the only evidence we have on this guy really been destroyed?!)

And the defense will continue to assert that you are the phantom! Furthermore, we have proof! ............Or at least, a prayer!
I-I know! I'm trying! (There's only one thing that can unmask this menace: the moon rock! But that was blown to bits in the courtroom bombing. And yet, is it really gone without a trace? What if... some tiny part, some little fragment still exists...?)
(That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?)


Take a look at this!
This is the last fragment of hope that I have. This is what will give us the strength to carry on!
(Not exactly the reaction I was hoping for...)
Y-Yes, Your Honor!
(Argh! Is the moon rock really completely gone? No, I refuse to believe that all hope is lost!)
Yes, Your Honor. Focus your attention on this photo taken after the bombing -- specifically, right here.


This is the last fragment of hope left to us. With this, we will build our dreams and pass them down to future generations. Gaaaaagh!
All right... So I got it wrong...
(I'd better take another good look at the photo. I just know the answer we've been looking for is right there in front of my eyes!)
Please take a look at this newspaper article.
Now please note the strange black and yellow rock there on the left. That's the moon rock. And when we look at this photo of the bomb fragments... ...see how there is a rock-like object with the same coloration?
It would seem that the moon rock was much more durable than the phantom thought. If we take a look at all the fragments that the police found, we'll likely find one with blood. And DNA testing on that blood will prove that the witness is indeed the phantom.
There's no use in trying to talk your way out of it anymore! Admit it! You are the phantom!
............Huh?
No. I didn't say a word...
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!
Now he's me...?
Huh? ............Oh, uh, no, not really, Your Honor.
(Could this trial get any more insane...?)
............Care to explain what you mean?

Don't be absurd! Just compare the fragment with the rock in the newspaper article! Anybody can see they're the same! They have the exact same coloration!
It's highly unlikely a rock with such a unique appearance just "happened" to be here!
(Even he must realize how ridiculous that sounds! And yet, I suppose it's not completely out of the question...)
(You're the last person I want to hear that from.)

............ So the moon rock doesn't exist anymore, huh?
(He's wrong. It's not completely lost. There's another piece of it, right here by our side! A shining fragment of hope that can turn everything around! The final piece of evidence to put this phantom away for good!) The defense has a piece of evidence that completely contradicts your claim.
A final fragment of hope that was passed down with great love and care!
(We do. Even if the person holding it hasn't realized it yet...)
I wonder if you'll be able to force your biggest smile when you see what I've got.
(The piece of evidence that shows the original moon rock isn't completely lost is this!)

Doesn't it, Your Honor?
(The moon, huh...? Well, then, maybe I will!)
Please let me try again, Your Honor!
Athena, you may not know it, but... ...your mother left with you a very important piece of evidence.
Oh, but we do! Evidence that will finally corner you. Because we have a moon rock of our own.
(Exactly. A gift Dr. Cykes left her daughter... An item Athena has cherished and worn all these years...)
This is the defense's sample of the moon rock!
This earring that Ms. Cykes always wears... ...was made from that original moon rock!
If the composition of the bombed fragments and the earring are found to be a match... ...then it will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt the origin of the fragment in this photo. And since the test results showed that the blood on the fragments was yours... ...this means that the identity you tried so hard to hide will finally be revealed!
I may not have Athena's ears, but now, even I can hear the fear in your voice!

I know it's hard for someone as unwilling to trust others as you to understand... But people have emotions. It's just a fact of life. And so, people can be weak at times. But that's exactly why people need to trust one another... ...so they can gain the strength to face themselves when things are at their bleakest. Without trust in others... ...how can you ever hope to face your fears?
Confront your guilt head-on...
Thank you, Pearls! And thank you for being there for Athena.
Trucy! Are you all right? Are you hurt?
............Edgeworth.
Aw, c'mon, Edgeworth! What are you talking about? You're the ones who have been tracking the phantom all this time. Plus, you were the one who gave Blackquill permission to serve as prosecutor, right?
Well, we never would've won this trial without you. It was your help as chief prosecutor that was the key to its succesful conclusion. Besides............ ...it was you that saw to it I got my attorney's badge back, wasn't it?
Yeah. Getting my license back went just a little too smoothly, you know? It should've been much harder after that evidence-forging scandal.
Hey, Edgeworth, think we can finally bring the dark age of the law to an end?
You know, you could've said that with a bigger smile, Edgeworth. It won't kill you. Instead, the furrows in that brow of yours just keep getting deeper and deeper.
(............Thatta girl, Athena. It's good to see you finally let your tears out.)
(That's some loyalty... This guy really is a samurai, through and through.) Well, it looks like we can breathe easy now. Apollo, Athena, thank you both. It took all of us together to pull it off.
I'm a lucky guy... My office has the best, most capable lawyers around!
You're right. And I'll be needing you both to help them. We still have a long way to go! (Get ready, you two... We won a major victory, but the war is far from over. There are still people out there suffering under false charges who need defending. We've got a lot of work ahead of us... ...if we ever hope to fully bring the dark age of the law to a close...)
Huh?
Huh? Huh?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
............ ...Um, guys? Under these circumstances... there's only one thing I can say.
Okay, here we go...!
Just believe in yourself!
Through the years, I've seen as much joy as heartache, honesty as deceit. But just as Mr. Starbuck was able to escape the harsh pull of his fears and despair... I believe that hope and friendship can lift us all up towards a brighter tomorrow.
But isn't that statement inconsistent with this piece of evidence?
You haven't changed either, Your Honor! (Come to think of it, he really hasn't...)
Gah! (I guess I'd better take another look at the evidence...)
Mr. Edgeworth, are you aware... ...of the contradiction between that statement and this piece of evidence?
(Ouch. That was harsh.)
Well... if Mr. Edgeworth doesn't think there's a contradiction, maybe there really isn't...
(I guess I'd better take another look at the evidence...)
That statement is clearly inconsistent with this evidence!
(Uh-oh! Looks like I got it wrong!)
Oh, it's nothing, Your Honor. I'm just having a little bit of trouble.
(Hmm? Did he just say "press"...? That's it! That's what I should be doing now! Pressing the witness!)
Ha ha ha! Well, at times like this, my partner usually throws me a lifeline... (But I'm up here all by my lonesome today...)
............ (I can't stop thinking about them... But I can't start getting sentimental now. Focus, Phoenix, focus! If I look back at everything I've learned... Yes, that one statement is definitely fishy!)

When we view your emotions alongside your testimony, we find the unexpected emotion-- (Wait a minute... There really isn't anything strange here.)
......I think maybe you're right.

Prosecutor Blackquill, your statement is inconsistent with this evidence.
Gah... (Hmm. Maybe I'd better look for inconsistent emotions instead... Now, contradictory testimony or inconsistent emotions... Which should I tackle first?)
Okay, let's present some evidence here!
Okay, let's look for inconsistent emotions!

The root cause of all these emotions... is this!
(Guess that's not it then... What could've caused Blackquill to react with all of these emotions all at once?)
The witness's statement is contradictory to this piece of evidence.
...My apologies, Your Honor. It looks like I was wrong.
(I'd better check his statements against the evidence carefully!)
Don't you find this statement to be a bit odd?
Huh?
Huh? (He'd better not be talking about my hair.)
(Subtle, aren't you?)
(Maybe I'd better listen to the testimony again...)
That statement is clearly inconsistent with-- AAAAAAAGH!!
(Agh. I must've gotten it wrong.) Um, could you at least tell me why you think so?
I-I'll try to draw faster next time...
(Gee, how well they work together...)
Yeah, maybe a little. (Or maybe a lot.)  
(You know, I think he might be right.) Thanks, Apollo. Time to turn things around!
Wh-What is it, Apollo?
Sure. Go ahead. (...'Cause I've got nothin'.)  
Um, yes, I think so, too... (I have no idea, actually. Thanks, Apollo. I'll put your intuition to the test right now.)

Maybe this...?
But there has to be something here. I just know it!
(The one that doesn't disappear, huh? I'll give it another look, then.)
Prosecutor Blackquill was executed as scheduled the next day. As for Aura Blackquill... She and her robots took Trucy and the rest of the hostages and vanished without a trace. Athena left the office... Apollo stopped smiling... And I, realizing my uselessness as a lawyer, took off my badge for good.
B-But...!
No matter what I said, I couldn't change Aura Blackquill's mind. Athena was taken away... ...and I never heard from her again.
After that, the phantom vanished completely. The case remained unsolved, and we were never able to uncover the truth. As the days passed, the dark age of the law... only grew darker and darker.
Nothing particularly interesting here.
(I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)

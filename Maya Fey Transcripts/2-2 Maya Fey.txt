I finally get to see you again, and...
No, I... I did it... I killed that person.
It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me.
We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.
Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up!
Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.
No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...
Heh, heh...
Yeah. I didn't think it would be this soon.
Ha ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident!
The tabloids.
... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey.
Oh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me.
Yup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place "Medium Valley", too.
Pretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think...
Actually, only the women of this village are mediums.
They usually work someplace outside the village.
Oh, you mean Pearly?
Pearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly!
Yup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling!
Nah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that "if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away".
Well, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters...
Pearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village.
Pearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick.
Ah, it's good to see this tarnished badge again.
Well, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea.
Ha ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick!
You'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now!
Hey, it's my client!
I thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, "My client."
Hmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick.
Ha ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today.
Hey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. "All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties." Well?
Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start.
I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers!
Thanks!
Yup, right here.
It'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started.
N... Nick! Nick! I...!
What am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this!
I finally... I finally get to see you again, and...
No, I... I did it... I killed that person.
It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so...
...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand.
Actually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday...
You believe in us, don't you?
... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him.
We closed our eyes...and I began the channeling.
And that's the last thing I remember...
After a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness.
When I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes.
Oh! But... I do remember having a dream.
Um... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that.
There was a really familiar smell too...
Yeah, I can't quite place it, but I know I've smelled that same scent before...
Make sure you show that to Pearly, OK, Nick? I'm sure she'll be a big help to you.
I... I can't face myself...
!! T-The... That's the guy I k-killed...
Pearly... She definitely has more than me...
Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training...
I... I can't face my aunt right now... Not now... that this has happened...
Yeah, I know... But still...
That's Lotta Hart... right?
Ha ha. I guess some things never change.
I felt terrible during the questioning session... I mean, Gumshoe kept looking at me... with these really sad eyes... ...
Sorry, Nick, but there's nothing really special about it.
...?
Huh? "It"? What is "it"?
...! But...
Are you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer!
But I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...!
It's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure...
... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared...
It sounds like tomorrow.
Wait.
This jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers.
Whaaaaaaaat!? Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...?
Successor...? ... Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man. He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.
It's no good...
Pearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!
Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?
Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?
Pearly... What about the train?
Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!
Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.
I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.
Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.
It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...
Huh...? But why, Nick?
Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?
N...Nick...?
I know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air...
By the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...?
Oh... Another jam, like always... Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!
Yeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher.
...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me!
...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me!
Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!?
Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know?
Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room.
Yeah. I'm counting on you!
Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me?
Hey, Nick... I've been waiting...
So? So? How was it!? What did you find out!?
My eyes are tearing up, Nick. Don't make me cry...
I'm sorry, Nick. Every time I see you, all I do is cause trouble...
You were fantastic, Nick! Every time I thought our goose was cooked, you managed to turn it all around. I bet it would make a great Hollywood movie!
...Thanks a lot. Really. Hey, Nick? The person who shot Dr. Grey wasn't me, was it?
If that were true, then I'd be really happy, but... there wasn't anyone else in that room with the two of us, right?
Um... I took a quick glance, but there wasn't anyone there.
Um, Nick...
Why do you believe in me? Why do you think I didn't kill Dr. Grey?
My sis? What did she tell you?
Now that you mention it... Wait, then... then... I really am...?
Drugged...?
That's... That's...
Pearly? What about her?
Hmm... W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think she did it, do you!?
She'd never do anything like that! You hear me!? Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute.
Hmm...
Yeah. The two of us. We were playing with her ball.
It's nothing really special... Just a plain old ball. I think she was still playing with it when I started the channeling job that day. Pearly really loves to play with that ball.
When she wants to get it, she always climbs right into the clothing box.
Yeah. Pearly's always hiding in there. You know the Side Room? There's a clothing box in there. It's really big, so once you see it, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about.
It's the same as the last time I saw it. You just like to show it off, don't you, Nick? Are you that thrilled to be a lawyer?
That hole... It looks an awful lot like a bullet hole...
That's TERRIBLE! How could this happen to such an important screen!?
... Hey, you're right! So I was the one who was about to get shot, huh? Th-That's TERRIBLE! Who'd want to shoot little ol' me!?
Ah! That's... The Channeling Chamber's...
Yeah. During the trial, I was kinda wondering why you had it...
That's weird... I swear I locked the door... and then put the key into one of my pouchy sleeves...
I wonder where Pearly found that key...
That's a knife from my family's kitchen. I'll never be able to use it again...
Argh! That's not the point! ...I don't ever want to see another knife... ever again...
That... That's... That's mine, isn't it?
It really was me, wasn't it? Wasn't it, Nick?
This... This is me, right? I guess I really did shoot Dr. Grey...
Is too!
Is too, is too!
That's Kurain's Sacred Urn. Mystic Ami's soul is sealed inside of it.
Ooh, look at Mr. Smarty here! Thinks he knows all! You sound like an occult fanatic.
You know, I haven't looked at this in a long time. I wonder when it became so cracked?
...What is it?
Huh? Is it trash burning day already?
What am I supposed to do, sis!? ...
Pearly... She definitely has more than me...
Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training...
So she's Prosecutor von Karma's daughter, huh?
Well, then... she'd know about that person, right?
...
...Mystic Ami. She's a Legendary Spirit Medium. I like the way that word sounds... "Legendary"... Ever since I was young, I've dreamed of being a "Legend".
Um, I can't think of anything special about it...
Um... Nick...
Did you know that Von Karma's daughter is only 18... Just like me...?
I was just thinking about how strong she is... I mean, she's been in Germany all this time all by herself, and she's so grown up!
...And then you look at me, and, well... I'm the daughter of the Master, but I'm still just a little girl. And on top of that, I'm the suspect in a murder trial.
Hey! Morning, Pearly!
Huh? What do you mean?
Y-Yeah... Yeah! That's right, Pearly!
P-Pearly! N-Not this again...
Nick?
...Wh-What do you mean...? What's going on...?
...Is it really true... about my aunt...?
That... That's terrible... Why? Why would my aunt...?
Why are you doing this!? Why are you trying to take revenge on Nick!? Nick had nothing to do with what happened to your dad.
Ugnn... ...Looking down on me, even though we're the same age...
S-Sis!
Sis! Sis... I-I didn't kill anyone, did I?
You know, sis... In my dream, I smelled a really familiar scent.
I was inside that clothing box, right? That box... That was the box you used to store your clothes in a long time ago...
Nick!
Thanks! Looks like you bailed me out of another jam.
But... I really don't want something like this to happen ever again.
I'm fine because I have you to help me out, Nick... But every time something happens, I lose someone special to me. First my sister... And now my aunt...
Hey, Nick... Tell me... Tell me why my aunt went and did something so horrible? Why would she help Ms. Mimi with a plan like that...!? I just... I just don't understand it, Nick...
Nick, please, I need an answer...
... Pearly?
A-And...?
... ...The branch family... My aunt...
...Aaaah!
Y-Yeah... I can see that... ...
...? I don't get it.
...
Yeah... Thanks, Nick.

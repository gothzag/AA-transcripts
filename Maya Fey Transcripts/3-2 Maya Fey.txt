Hey, Nick! Get a load of this! Hey, are you listening to me!? You can clean the toilet later! This is important!
Hey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!
We're about to hit the big time!
Ha! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!
That's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.
Ha ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!
That's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?
I've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.
Hey! Who are you calling "shady"!?
Earth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?
Oh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!
Say, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.
Well, we're always looking for new ways you know!
Hmm... Well it must be for the greatest treasure of all!
Huh? Why... Of course there is! Right, Pearly?
Yeah, I'll bet it would really take your breath away!
Of course they are! This is a "Treasure Exhibit", isn't it!?
Ah! It's so cute! It's a little diorama of Kurain Village!
Yikes! You're right! I kinda want to add "The Famous" in front of it!
Don't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!
Eeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!
Is she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?
Oh, um... N-Nice to meet you.
And that means what?
I see... That's some pretty high-tech stuff.
Aha! I've got it! Maybe it's supposed to say, "Hamburger"!
Like, maybe for the "World Hamburger Festival" or something?
Aha! I've got it! Maybe it said, "Spaghetti"!
Well, maybe it was a typo! It might have said, "Spaghetti Festival". What do you think?
Look, a ladder!
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Really? Let's go in! I wanna take a look!
...Did you hear that, Nick? We're unathorized personnel.
Don't ask me! How should I know...?
Maybe so, but this is the first time I've ever seen this statue.
...Aww, phooey. I wanted to cut something!
No it doesn't, Nick! It says, "ORGANIZE"! You just can't see the last two letters.
Yeah. You must feel right at home, huh?
Nick! What's going on!? Who is this woman!?
What? I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I got all worked up. That's all.
Not really... I was stuck in a dark wine cellar... Did that escape your memory, Nick?
Woohoo! Did you hear that, Pearly!? The finest museums!
I think what Nick means to say is, "It wasn't thanks to the badge, it was thanks to ME!" Tell the truth, Nick! I know that's what you were thinking!
Maybe, but who'd wanna see an exhibit on the "Treasures of Phoenix Wright"?
You're such a dork, Nick.
... ...I guess I wasn't much of a help, huh?
Ooh! I like the sound of that! "Dine"... It sounds so fancy!
Ha ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a "Kid's Dinner"?
N-Nick! This is terrible! ...What the--!? You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!
Well, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!
Yes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque! Our most valuable treasure... The Kurain Sacred Urn was STOLEN!!
Hey! Nick! No time for daydreaming!
Hey! Nick! Are you trying to make me upset!?
Hey, Nick! This is no time for reading!
It's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster!
Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?
... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name "AMI", written on it... Now it says "I AM"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?
What's wrong with you, Nick!?
What do you mean what do I--
Yeah! And get the Sacred Urn back!
Mask☆DeMasque, Nick! Make a note of it! Mask☆DeMasque!
Ah, it was terrible! I was arrested and everything!
Oh, hey! It's my Magatama! So what do you think, Nick? Isn't it neat?
What? How do you do that!?
Well, I knew Pearly put some sort of spiritual power into it... But I had no idea that it let you do something as cool as that!
Next time you use it, let me know, OK!? I want to see into people's minds, too!
But it's got the soul of Mystic Ami, the founder of our channeling technique!
What!? Sell the Sacred Urn!? You know, I never thought about that... Hey Pearly... Make a note of that. "Ways to Save Money, Tip 109: Sell treasures whenever possible."
You know, even I didn't know this statue existed until a little while ago.
Yes, there are actually a lot of training halls scattered all over the country. Hidden away deep in desolate mountains...
You're not very photogenic, are you?
S-Sis... *sniffle* I really miss her...
Yeah, she was awesome! She taught Nick everything he knows.
I'm going to have to really buckle down and get serious.
Yeah... That, and I have to play the part of big sister, too. For Pearly... and you, Nick!
Pearly is such a cutie, isn't she Nick?
And she's smart too, just like yours truly! She's got quite a future ahead of her! I bet she could be President some day!
She certainly seems grateful to you, Nick.
Hmm... It sounds like you're not telling me something. I'm going to take a good look at the case file next chance I get...
Hmm... What about it, Pearly?
Hmm... What do you think, Pearly?
Yeah, it looks preety much the same as it did last night.
Alright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?
And if it's too long for you, you can just call him "Dick".
Detective, can't you tell us something other than that?
The scene of the crime... You mean here, right?
A-Ace Detective...?
Whaaaat!? You're joking, right Nick? Mask☆DeMasque is the hottest thing sice sliced bread!
What!? Then you knew he was planning on stealing the Sacred Urn!?
So? What's he like?
They didn't mention THAT on the news flash.
...That makes sense. When you get famous, there are always imitators.
The "Sacred Urn of Kurain" is famous, too! ...Right, Pearly!?
...That's not what happened this time, you mean?
What are you doing carrying that around with you anyway? It's not like we ever need it.
Huh? You knew her? You knew my sis?
Yeah, you're doing a really great job. I can see.
Somehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.
Somehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.
No matter how may times we come here, this place always give me the chills.
Err, umm... Who are you anyway...?
Wh-What do you see?
Yikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?
What is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...
Don't let him intimidate you, Nick! Stand up and show him what you're made of!
I'm Maya Fey! Ace Spirit Medium!
...Could you translate that for me, Nick?
Does he have any top-secret information? Stuff that only a real crime buff would know?
...Boy, now I'm really lost. What is he saying, Nick?
Yeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the "Great People of the Town" segment. They said that the museum gave you an incredible jewel as a reward!
Oh! Tell us what you know about Mask☆DeMasque! ...And keep it simple, please!
Huh? You were hired BEFORE the calling card even arrived?
A calling card arrived, right?
Alone? ...But why? Why didn't you go to the police for help?
Anyway, back to what happened last night...
Thank you, Detective Atmey! I'm counting on you!
Yeah, but don't forget he managed to retrieve the treasure from the last heist.
Well, we've got an Ace Lawyer, an Ace Spirit Medium and an Ace Cousin-Apperentice here.
Or maybe he just took a look at the attorney's badge on your lapel, genius.
Eww, this guy's even creepier than I thought.
Umm... So how did you know I was a spirit medium?
Well, they also have a bio about me on the Treasure Exhibit Poster...
Huh? You know her?
Wretched, huh...
If Detective Gumshoe heard that, he'd probably cry.
Stop messing around, Nick, and just ask him already!
Nah, it's OK. Nick is just a bit of a piddling evidence hog. That's his defense style.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
That's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!
Of-Office of Earthly D-Delights...?
Come on, Nick. Don't worry about it. It's no big deal. Let's hurry up and investigate before he changes his mind!
Yeah, go stand in front of that door and it'll snap your photo too, Pearly.
Nah. It's for criminals, so I think you should make a really scary face!
Hey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!
Let's see if we can find last night's data on this thing. We might even find a photo of Mask☆DeMasque!
I had no idea you were so pathetic with high-tech stuff, Nick!
I guess you have to learn to crawl before you can walk, right, Nick?
Hey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!
Ahh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!
Grr... I worked so hard to make that box!
What's that supposed to mean!?
And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*
Wow, this is awesome. What did Ms. Andrews say it was called again?
"One hit, seven times the fun!" Pretty catchy, huh? I bet it'd sell like hotcakes!
Wow! You're really firing on all cylinders today, Pearly!
Ah...
Awesome, Pearly! I wouldn't expect any less from my little Ace Appretice!
Aha. I just thought of something! Maybe Detective Atmey smashed Mask☆DeMasque with it. Like this!
What do you think, Pearly?
I guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.
Look what you did, Nick! You spilled paint over here!
Well it wasn't here last night. I would have noticed a color this outrageous.
Well then, you should have cleaned it up before it dried, Nick!
Huh? ...You're right. I wonder what it could be...?
This statue of Mystic Ami is sooo cool. I want a gold statue of myself! We could put it in the office!
Ah...
Great job, Pearly! I wouldn't expect anything less from my Ace Cousin!
Oh, Nick! Your cell phone's ringing!
You "caught him"? ...Are you saying...? You... You captured Mask☆DeMasque!?
Whaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick?
H-Hello? Is anyone here...?
Hmph. What a waste of time. Hey! I know! Let's taek that framed picture back with us as a memento!
Hey, Nick. What's this thing here?
You can't be serious! I think it's probably for purifying the air or something. I'll bet you 50 cents! Come on, what do you say?
Maybe we should put up a big portrait of you in the office, Nick! I can even paint it for you. Maybe you can pose while cleaining the toilet?
Whoa! It's a huge hearth!
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
"My Life as an Ace Detective: Unabridged Edition" by Luke Atmey, Ace Detective.
Ah! Would you look at that! There's a little Luke Atmey doll at the helm! How cute!
This one says... "Atmey Virus", ...Hmm. This guy is just dying to make a name for himself, huh.
Oh, I just love chemistry! Say, Nick, I bet you didn't know this, but... Water is made up of carbon and hydrogen!
Oh? Well, there are always alternative theories, I guess.
Right, but... Um... So where's the Sacred Urn?
Huh?
You know, he's right, Nick!
If you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!
I'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.
But anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!
...Um, who are you?
...Hey, Nick... Dosen't he look kind of... Well, gangly?
...What's with this guy?
I know why! It's because you stole such a priceless treasure! And now you're overwhelmed with guilt. Am I right!?
...D-Dessie?
Look, we really want our urn back, so where is it?
Mr. DeMasque? About the urn...
Enough already! Just tell it to us straight!
Wh-Wha-What!?
...I-I guess she must be his wife...
Let's go have a look, Nick! To Mask☆DeMasque's hideout!
Wh-What do you mean...?
What!? You forgot our Sacred Urn on a train!?
Are you really sure this creep is Mask☆DeMasque?
If you're so sorry, then you shouldn't have stolen it in the first place!
...He sure seems sorry.
He looks so happy...
They ARE rivals! Only people who have it out for each other would disagree like this!
I didn't really catch that.
No doubt about it, this is Mask☆DeMasque's hideout alright.
I'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.
Well, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.
Oh, that's so cute! It's called a hot air balloon, you know!
I want to make my own balloon now! I'll even let you ride in it, Nick!
Duck and cover! It-It's a missile! Did you know there's d-dynamite in missiles!?
What are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? "Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy" "Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy"
Hey, Nick! Look on top of the chair!
Well, don't just stand there! Come on, let's read it!
What are you talking about? That letter could be an important clue!
...Hmph! It's not just because I "feel like it". It really could be important!
L-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!
Hey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!
Now put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix☆DeMasque! Let's borrow it for a while.
Oh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...
And that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.
Nick... Do you think maybe you could act like a grown-up for a little bit?
It's Mask☆DeMasque!
Let me see that!
... I don't get it... What's this supposed to be, Nick?
Nick! It-It's a torpedo!
Where could he have picked up something like this?
Wow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!
...
Huh? Really!?
Huh...? B-But... Are you saying he didn't?
W-Well, you know... It's a p-priceless treasure! And-And he's... You know...
Oh... Excitement, huh?
No offense, but your husband, Ron, doesn't exactly look like the risk-taking type himself.
So where does Mr. DeLite get all this money from?
Well, according to Detective Gumshoe, it was around 1:30 in the morning.
P-Pulled over?
Well, what about Mr. DeLite?
Heroic figures? But Mask☆DeMasque is a bad guy.
Maybe it's true... Maybe Mr. DeLite isn't Mask☆DeMasque after all.
Really!? That's one of our most treasured possessions! There's going to be a whole exhibit at Lordly Tailor with these types of things!
Huh! ...Oh, err, yeah... Ha ha ha...
No! You can't show her that, Nick! That emblem is top-secret! Don't you remember!?
Oh no, you've got it wrong. It's my mother that's the current Master!
Well, you see, it's li-
Ouch... That hurt.
Yup... Wha...? ...Huh?
WH-WHAAAAT!? What are you talking about!?
Really? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?
Wow, you must've really seen skyrockets when you first met to love him so much!
Oh! That's so sweet!
Now she's starting to sound a bit greedy... Don't you think, Nick?
I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.
A letter?
Ms. DeLite... OK, you've got it! Just relax and leave it all to us!
He looks so happy...
Huh...?
Hey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!
What do you mean, "why not"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!
Come on! She could be lying to protect her husband!
Hey! What're you doing, Nick!?
Don't do it, Nick! He's a thief!
P-! Pearly...! Wait!
I-I'll go after her!
She said she's going back to the office. Go check in on her later, would you?
Y-Yeah... I'm fine, Nick. I believe in you.
OK, Nick! Let's get this show on the road!
It looks like she feels really bad about what happened at the detention center...
Oh... Thanks...
Too late...
But what...?
Huh!? Err, I... ...Umm...There's something you need to understand...
Umm... It's kind of like a Kurain Village custom... Sort of.
Well, it's because I'm her only cousin. And... Well... Because of the murder case last year, Pearly's mother is...
So you see? I'm the only family Pearly has right now... But... It's the same for me, too.
My mother's gone, too...
There are hardly any men in Kurain Village.
I'm pretty sure I told you about it a long time ago... About how spiritual powers run very strong in the Fey family.
Yeah... The thing is, only women can actually inherit the spiritual power. That's why the whole culture of Kurain Village kinda revolves around its women.
Yeah, but because of that... There tends to be a lot of unsuccessful marriages.
Well, men start to feel left out after a while, and then they just start leaving. ...Especially if the man has a daughter.
...He's gone. He left the village when she was very young.
Yeah, and she grew up seeing nothing but unhappy marriages all around her. That's why she's so sensitive to things like that.
Yeah... And no one has any idea where she is.
Yeah... I know she is... It's sort of a spirit medium thing...
Then according to the laws of the village, I'll become the next Master.
Yeah, but there's no one else with the blood of the Fey main family who's a spirit medium.
So you've still got that badge, I see.
Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.
You know, I thought we'd finally found the urn.
Huh? You mean he's NOT Mask☆DeMasque?
Hmm... The mystery gets deeper and deeper.
Yup, Detective Gumshoe said it was the real thing. "One look at this mark and you know it's the real deal, pal."
This sword... It has a strange aura surrounding it. It's like it's infused with a spirit of both anger and tragedy.
...Yeah, I guess that could be it.
When did you first get that porcupine cut?
What!? You mean that's the way your hair is naturally? I thought you had some sort of special "Phoenix Cut" deal with the barber. I mean... You usually only see hair like that in a video game.
Yeah, she told me you used to really be useless. Compared to how unreliable you were then, you actually seem responsible now. ...Actually, you haven't changed that much, I guess.
I'm so sorry that Pearly said what she did.
Detective Gumshoe's on this case too, huh.
Maybe it's a sign that our fates are destined to be woven together for all time!
So the real identity of Mask☆DeMasque is... ...Ron DeLite, right?
Huh? About what?
Yeah, now that you mention it, he said that he simply "lost it", right?
That Detective Atmey guy really surprised me. There was this certain something about the way he said, "Zvarri!"
Yeah, I guess. ...That case has certainly made him famous.
That Desirée sure is cool! I love that whole motorcycle thing! The way she laughs in the face of death... I want to try it myself!
Hey! Don't forget, Nick, that it's an electric bike!
Hmmm... It seems like it has something to do with this case... But I'm not really sure...
Well, Nick! Why don't we go out and start investigating? We're not going to learn anything just sitting around the office!
Nick... Let's back off and give her some room, OK?
Oh, Ms. Andrews...
N-No, it's okay, don--
Hold on, just wait, OK? Breathe, calm down and talk to us.
Yeah, I guess so...
Hmm... I think it's a little too small for that. What about my Magatama?
It's the folding screen of Kurain Sacred Writings. But I can't read what it says on it.
Ahh, yeah. My mother read it and taught me to memorize it. I'll be in trouble if I ever forget it.
Wow, this is incredible! It's a tiny version of my Kurain Village! Hey! I've got a great idea! We can make a miniature of your office, Nick!
Well, we could always clean it up first.
Um, so you asked Detective Atmey to help with security?
Um, can you tell us a bit about the security for the Treasure Exhibit?
Zero!?
B-But that urn contains the soul of Mystic Ami...
So maybe one of them was actually Mask☆DeMasque in disguise...!
Good question! Let's take a look at it. ...Huh? It says "Property of Lordly Tailor" on it.
Kind of strange for an "Ace Detective", don't you think?
Yeah, I guess so. The shutter did go off once, you know.
Ahh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!
Grr... I worked so hard to make that box!
What's that supposed to mean!? And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*
I'm really starting to like this thing. It's so cool-looking. I'd like to strap it to my waist and walk around town like a samurai.
Our precious urn was right there on the other side of these doors.
Someone was in there last night. Grrr... What I'd like to do to him...!
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
Yeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?
Maybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.
Hello?
Wh-What is?
...Umm. I think we've already been through this.
Aaah! So the music in this room is coming from here!
Aha! That's just what I thought! I told you so, Nick!
That's quite a large portrait of yourself you have there...
...Um, that's nice.
Aaah! There's a cold breeze coming from this hearth!
Wh-Why would you put an air conditioner in there?
I heard you've been after Mask☆DeMasque since his very first theft?
So... that's why you were hired as security for the Treasure Exhibit?
But I thought you were watching the area yourself, too. So how did Mask☆DeMasque manage to steal the urn?
Umm... Mr. Atmey? Did you know about the Sacred Urn?
...I don't think I like this guy's attitude, Nick.
Umm... There's something that's kind of bothering me.
Well, I was wondering how Mask☆DeMasque managed to steal the urn. I mean, isn't it strange that you don't seem to know?
Ps-Psyche Lock...?
Nick! Go for it! Let's break that Psyche-Lock of his!
Hey, Nick, what is the Psyche-Lock thing?
Whaaaaat!? This Magatama has THAT kind of power!?
...Well, it's true that this Magatama is a prized Fey family heirloom, but... Pearly was the one that actually imbued it with spiritual powers, right? That's why I don't really know much about what it can do.
So how do you do it? How do you break the Psyche-Lock thing?
...Cool! I can't wait to see it in action! Come on! Try it out!
...He sounds pretty sure.
Is there anything that isn't "unmistakable" to you...
Is something wrong? Did the cat get your tongue or something?
So, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you?
So you never noticed that the thief had entered the warehouse?
Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.
Huh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?
Oh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask☆DeMasque...
But you never actually saw him!
Oh...
M-Mask☆DeMasque...!
B-But how would you know about that...?
Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?
OK! Let's have a look! "If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world... ...come to KB Security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000." F-F-F-Fifty thousand...!
Ah...! Larry! Long time no see!
Do you think Ms. DeLite knows about this?
I wonder if we should tell her about it...
Well, actually... Anyway sounds like you had quite the adventure.
So you said you found it at your job, right?
He... works there? You mean... Mr. DeLite?
What's this card?
Huh...? So what are you doing here then?
And it would take roughly an hour to go from here to KB Security and back.
Whoa...! Then he couldn't have stolen Sacred Urn!
...
Um, yeah... So what?
Wh... Whaaaat!
It leaves a record?
Wow! You really do remember!
You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!
Oh, really!?
Hey! That's my cousin! Her name is Pearl Fey.
Boy, talk about someone who has a one track mind...
A long time, huh?
Oh, Nick! Your phone!
Whaaaat!? Give me that phone, Nick! P-Pearly! Where are you right now!?
"That person"...? Who!?
Pearly!
Say, Nick... Doesn't look like something's changed since we were here last?
This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before.
Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!
Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation!
Well? What's in there?
EEEEEEK! H-He's here!
Nick! I can't believe you!
Wow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting.
So what's in there, Nick? What's in the bag?
C-C-Conspirators!?
Wh-What are you talking about...?
Hey! Last time I checked, no one knows for sure that Mr. DeLite really is DeMasque!
Um... Who is this "Godot" person...?
But the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!?
Huh...?
Well, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow!
Ummm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this?
Huh...?
...Creep.
Hey, Nick!
Nah. But did you see all the people here? It's crazy! Oh! Look at this! I bought this Mask☆DeMasque publicity photo!
You know I'm sucker for this kind of stuff!
Ungh... He's at it again.
Ah! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...
This guy is the real deal alright, Nick...
N-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?
Well, Nick? What are you going to do?
An "author"...? He's written books about thieves?
That's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police.
Wow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.
Somehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type...
Nick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!
But... But...
So even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...
N-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?
Fake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.
This is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake...
Nick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!?
Isn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?
Grrr... This guy is one cool customer.
Boy, these two make a prefect pair...
Gumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene...
And you lost your memory, too!
As usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying.
There's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?
Huh? Which piece...?
Nick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?
Well that wasn't very much help at all...
So Mr. Atmey got hit on the forehead then?
Hmm... I've got a funny feeling about that.
Well what do you think, Nick?
Yeah? What is it!?
B-But why?
Wh-What are you doing, Nick!? Weren't you going to go on the attack?
N-Nick! Now's your chanse!
Are you alright, Nick?
Don't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!
B-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?
the Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!
Nick! Come on! It should be easy to prove! After all, we checked out that bag, didn't we?
Yes! It must have been the urn! It must have!
...?
Ack! You're right!!
But Nick!
N-Nick! Y-You can't let him do this...
N-Nick, what are you going to do now?
Wow... Even the judge is making cool, snappy remarks now...
Do you really think there's someone that could fit the bill?
Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!
Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?
This guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...
Nick, you were right after all!
He says he'll be happy to, Nick...
Come on, Nick! You know that Mr. DeLite couldn't have committed the crime! You're the one with the fancy law degree! It's time to put it to work already!
Well, I guess if you had that kind of proof, we wouldn't still be here, would we...?
What is it, Nick?
W-Well, you're right, but...
I guess he thinks "descended" sounds more heroic or thief-like or something.
Yes, but... I don't see what that has to do with anything. Right now we're trying to prove that Mr. DeLite isn't the thief, right?
Why does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask☆DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.
Anyway... Time to poke some holes in that testimony of his!
...He's really got Mr. DeLite all worked up...
"Planted" it there? He's really reaching now...
Nick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...
It looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...
Good job! You did it, Nick!
Nick! You did it! You were right after all! Actually... I'm a little bit ashamed of myself.
Umm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desirée DeLite. She's our client's wife.
Well, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!
But actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Kane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?
B-Body...?
Wh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?
No way...
N-Nick...! How could this be happening?
You know, I'm glad we found the urn and all, but poor Mr. DeLite got arrested again.
No way, Jose! I don't buy it!
Looks like you did too good of a job this time, Nick.
Sure. But why?
Oh, that's a good idea! I think I'll go with--
OK, Nick! Time to get doing on this murder investigation!
Isn't it obvious!? We should get out there and investigate the murder!
...Hey! Why don't we ask Ms. DeLite! She should know! Besides, I want to ask her some stuff about motorcycles!
I'm not the same little Maya who used to be happy with her dinky little bike, Nicky boy.
OK, well, let's make sure to go to the detention center, too!
You bet! ...But there's something a little different about it.
Don't "...?" at me! It's pretty obvious, isn't it? I mean, take a look at this. It clearly says, "I AM" on the urn in the poster. But the urn we got back says, "AMI", like it always used to.
Plus, the vase has pink splotches on it now... ...I'm sure they wasn't there before!
Is it possble that urn is a fake?
Yeah, I suppose...
Yup. If you want to become a spirit medium, you need to undergo severe training.
Well... Lately I've been thinking of heading to a channeling dojo to do just that.
If you're going to train, you have to be serious. Otherwise real tragedies can happen.
...
When a medium uses the Kurain Technique, she temporarily loses her own will.
I suppose not, but... ...I guess I'm still a bit shaken up. That's all.
I'm glad we got the Sacred Urn back and all...
Why should I!? I don't know if it should say "AMI" or "I AM" on it anymore... ...and now it's got big pink polka dots on it that weren't there anymore!
Overreacting!? Nick! I can't believe you said that! I mean, it's like... like... I got it! It's like if I came in wearing polka dots on my acolyte costume every day and said... "Hi, Nick! I'm Ayam!" Well!? Do you still think it's no big deal?
You see! You see! Well that's how I feel!
Um, 1 o'clock in the morning, right?
But... But then, what about this photo? It's got the time on it, too!
I guess that means this data is accurate after all.
So the Mask☆DeMasque in this photo... ...is Detective Atmey in disguise, huh?
Detective Atmey said it got bent when the thief hit him on the head with it.
Yeah... I guess he really does have a brawny mind, huh?
So Mr. DeLite was being blackmailed, huh? By the CEO of the security company he used to work for.
You'd better watch yourself and not do anything naughty either, Nick.
Yeah, it was used right around the time of the murder... Doesn't sound very good, huh?
So Detective Atmey was Mask☆DeMasque after all, huh?
Yes, but Mr. DeLite still hasn't changed his tune. He's still claming that he's the real Mask☆DeMasque. You don't think he's just saying that to avoid the murder charge, do you?
This was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. So does that mean... Detective Atmey put it there himself?
You're not very photogenic, are you?
Um, I was only joking, Nick... Don't make such a sad face. You're making me feel guilty.
Pearly sure is a good kid.
That's one of the things I like about her, silly! Slapping you the way she did! She's a tough one alright!
I can hardly believe that guy was really the thief in disguise! I never saw that coming! Then again, I stink at spotting those "plot twist" things.
Ha ha, yeah. Today was pretty wild. Like the plot of some crazy comic book!
Oh, it's Larry. He's your childhood friend, right?
Wow...! That's even longer than I've known Pearly. You two must have lots of good memories together!
Say, Nick... What do you think that thing attached to his face is anyway?
Why not? You know him, don't you?
Yeah, but at the trial today, he said...
Hey, Nick? I was just thinking... Maybe you should try to stop making people you've never met before into your enemies.
The Treasures of Kurain exhibit is all ruined now...
I'm sorry, it's just so sad... This was our big chance for everyone to learn about spirit channeling...
R-Really...?
...Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!! That's brilliant, Nick! We could clean up! And be filthy rich! Woohoo!
What do you mean, "Oh, that"!?
Yes! It was brought in during the trial today!
"Mr. Wright" had nothing to do with it. It was Mask☆DeMasque's wife that found it!
This is the camera and computer that Detective Atmey set up, huh?
And yet he still let it take a picture of him. I guess he's not as smart as he pretends to be!
Detective Atmey said he got hit on the back of the head with this by the thief. But that was obviously a lie.
P-Please be gentle with it...
I guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.
Yeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?
Maybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.
No it doesn't, Nick! It says, "ORGANIZE"! You just can't see the last two letters.
Yeah. So you should feel right at home, right?
Hey, Nick, if she wants to apologize, you should let her. So... When was it that you hired Detective Atmey again...?
I guess that's it then. Detective Atmey must have really wanted the Sacred Urn after all.
Nick, let's get down to business already. On the night of the theft, did you notice anything suspicious about Detective Atmey?
That's just what he says so he can have an alibi while he commits the thefts himself.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you Ms. Andrews?
What do you think this means, Nick!?
In court today, Ms. DeLite brought the urn back... But... It's a little different from the urn I remember.
Nick, I want to find out about the murder, but I also want to know about the urn.
You could put something like, "Voted Best Treasure Exhibit by Mask☆DeMasque"!
I wonder if it was because he knew it would be easy to steal.
A gold statue is totally cool in my book.
Detective Atmey said he got hit on the back of the head with this by the thief. But that was obviously a lie.
P-Please be gentle with it...
Really? I'd really happy to do whatever I can to help! Oh, I have an idea! Maybe I could sing a song? "The Master of Kurain" or "The Spirit Song" or perhaps "Maya's Theme"?
Well they don't... yet. I was going to make Nick write them.
Her name is Pearl. She's training to be a spirit medium!
Career woman, huh...?
Well, now Detective Gumshoe has one more failure to add to his list.
She really seems depressed.
Don't feel so sad. After we're here to help!
Oh, come on... I can tell you're happy anyway.
Oh, Ms. Andrews! I'm so happy to hear you say that!
What did you expect? Now that they know he was actually Mask☆DeMasque... This must be incredibly embarrassing for them, don't you think?
Well, he is a homicide detective. He's probably working on the murder case.
Well, a murder case is a lot more exciting, isn't it? He'd say something like: "There's nothin' like a good murder case, pal."
Eeek!
Boy! These policemen sure are a bunch of sourpusses!
Aww... It doesn't look like they're going to let us investigate.
A sad, pitiful whine that tapers into silence...
Man, and we don't have enough time as it is.
I guess you're right... That guard over there looks a bit on edge, too.
OK! Let's go check out some other place, Nick!
Don't say that, Nick! She don't need your help beating herself up.
What are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? "Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy" "Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy"
Really!? Did they say anything?
Amateur or not, this is cool! "Knucklebomber"! How cool is that!?
L-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!
Hey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!
Now put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix☆DeMasque!
Oh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...
And that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.
Oh, man... Now I want one, too!
It's Mask☆DeMasque!
Let me see that!
Well, that certainly is a happy-sounding laugh alright.
Yeah. Mr. DeLite really works hard at his craft, huh?
Wow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!
I wonder why Mr. DeLite never talked to his wife about it?
...I don't think he would either, Nick.
He would never say that! Anyway, Ms. DeLite, he might not be a killer... ...but he's still going around saying that he's a "thief"...
Huh? Get what?
Yeah, they sure are different.
What!? F-For you?
Umm... You mean Ace Detectives?
Oh... So then you must mean thieves?
By the way, why did you go to Detective Atmey's office anyway?
The "real criminal"...?
Y-Yeah...?
Oh yeah, we saw that bag there yesterday, too.
Ms. DeLite, do you know about KB Security?
It looks like Ms. DeLite doesn't know...
Ha ha, what a scaredy-cat you are, Nick!
OK. Let's head over there right away, Nick!
Umm... So was it really love at first sight when you first met Mr. DeLite?
Saved your life...?
Oh! I think I get it! Did Mr. DeLite come running to save you?
...Wow. That's a great story...
Nick, I hope you'll do the same for me if I ever get taken hostage...
Well, I have you to thank for that, Ms. DeLite! ...A-And I'm sorry.
Because I mistakenly blamed your husband for taking it...
It looks like Ms. DeLite doesn't know about it... Which means she has no idea that her husband was being blackmailed...
Because I mistakenly blamed your husband for taking it...
It was found at KB Security on the night of the murder...
Sure! Of course!
...?
Really? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?
It must be nice to have such a fond memory like that...
I don't blame you!
...Looks like he blew it again, huh?
You looked pretty silly wearing that mug on your head like a birthday hat... Oh, I know! We can get him back tomorrow by returning fire with a milk grenade!
The walls in here look thick... just you'd expect in a CEO's office.
Sure was, pal! That prosecutor made real fools out of us...
Wow, that's not like you at all... I thought you'd be more like... "Oh, that was great! You guys got what you deserved, pal! Ho ho ho ho!" Or something to that effect.
If the Gumshoe fits...
Wow, I had no idea Detective Gumshoe was such a nice guy.
Wow! This safe is unbelievable...
And it's got a bunch of doohickeys attached to it.
Hey, Nick. Come on! Let's open it and take a look!
This rope... You think it fell out of the safe when it was opened?
So, you mean...?
Y-Y-You mean... The victim... H-He was killed by being crushed by the safe door?
Wow! Look at that huge framed photo!
There's a title written at the bottom of the photo. "The Greatest Sunrise of My Life"... This is it? This was his best sunrise?
Maybe if he had lived a little longer, he would have seen some better days.
Hey, that looks like a super soft chair. Let me try it out, just for a second... Ooh. Nice... I feel just like a CEO. Hey, you! Whip me up a cup of some really expensive import tea and some scones! Move it! ...Ahhh, this is the life.
EEEEEEEK!
Leave the heavy lifting to me, Nick.
Wh-What did you find out, Nick?
What!? What kind of info?
...? Hey, Nick. Look at the last page!
So then "$100,000" is the value of the stolen item?
Oh, there's a button here. Let's see...
Ha ha ha! That was pretty funny. I never knew Detective Gumshoe could jump like that!
Oops, you're right! It's written right there! Nick, how many times have I told you to read the instructions first!?
Ooh! So when the CEO was attacked... ...do you think that maybe he pressed the buzzer...?
...Nnnnnf! I can't get in between these two shelves!
So I guess it's one shelf at a time, huh? Looks like they're filled with bunches of files.
It'd be a good night's reading. ...If you've got insomnia. I was hoping for something a little bit more exciting... Like UFOs or something.
Detective Gumshoe. Tell us what you know about the murder!
Hey, come on! What about how we "put our hearts into our work"? Things are really "working against us" right now and we need help...!
OK. I won't cry on you, pal.
So why did it take almost an entire day to discover the body?
I think we still need some more information about Mr. Billiard...
So, umm... What happened to Mask☆DeMasque?
Now that's the Detective I know and love.
A witness...?
Hey, this guard here... Haven't I seen him somewhere before?
Ooh! That prosecutor! I really don't like that guy! The way he used our own evidence to do that to Mr. DeLite...
Goosebumps...? You?
Poor Detective Gumshoe... I had no idea you were so unpopualr...
He was the CEO of KB Security, right? What kind of company is it anyway?
Really? Me too! I just love money! I can't ever get enough!
Oh! So that's my problem! I think I need to be shifter!
Ooh, that's pretty dirty and underhanded.
What? Really?
Umm, so about this...?
Hey! What are you doing!?
Ohh... My poor Magatama...
*glare*
*glare*
So Detective Atmey wasn't hit in the back of the head after all?
Grrr... What kind of a creep would ruin an antique for that...?
Nick, that's it! Maybe that's the same reason he's being blackmailed!
Oh... Alright.
I think we need to ask Mr. DeLite some more about those two things.
Umm, so about this...
What's wrong?
Err... Oh, it's nothing. It's just my billfold.
But, he got away anyway, huh?
Huh? You knew her? You knew my sis?
You're darn right I'm the victim! That was our most precious treasure!
But weren't YOU the one that arrested him with a giant goofy smile on your face...?
Really? Like what part?
Ah! You're right!
You really thought that?
It's Mr. Godot that acts like he knows Nick, not the other way around.
Detective Gumshoe! Tell us more about Mr. Shane Bluebard!
Oh yeah... The victim in this case just doesn't make much of an impression on me.
OK, Nick! Now is our chance to get more info about the victim, so hurry up and ask!
Detective Gumshoe... About this right here...
Hey, Nick, if you have something to say, just come out and say it.
Detective Gumshoe. What about this person?
He's the victim in this case. "Lame Blowhard"...
I know, but he looks so ugly!
...Now that you mention it, I guess he does kinda look like an ugly old bull.
So, he's the one who sent the blackmail letter to Mr. DeLite, right?
Oh really...?
Did Mr. DeLite ever have a problem with Mr. Bullard himself?
For a security guard office, it sure doesn't feel very secure.
Hi, Larry!
Really!? What is it!?
But Larry, I thought you two were old school buddies...
Umm... There's tea spilled all over that machine, you know!
"A Guard's 5 Commandments" ...Wow, this sounds serious. Let's see what it says... #1: Obey thy superior #2: Respect thy superior #3: Smile at thy superior #4: Salute thy superior #5: Buy donuts for thy superior upon command It's signed, "Wendy Oldbag, Head Supervisior".
Umm... Did you know you hung it right on top of some kind of lever?
...So why hang your jacket on such an important lever?
It's true... It's killing me, too! What about you, Nick?
Wow! Take a look at these things here! Hey! Hey, Larry! What are they!?
Oh boy...
Can you watch regular TV on these, too?
Look at all this equipment. It must be hard to operate.
"Somewhere"...?
Hey! What's that supposed to mean!
Larry! Tell us already! What's the "good info"!?
Yes, yes! So tell me!
Yes, you're a pro! I follow you! Go on!
I guess he must have done something bad to have gotten fired like that.
Monitors?
Oh...
What "teams"?
I don't think you can expect someone like him to take any responsibility.
Larry, I want you to tell me about the night of the murder.
Oh, is that right...?
Larry...
Huh? Your Donna?
Um, who was?
Y-Yeah...
He's curled up on the floor, crying like a baby.
Hey Nick, as long as he's offering, why don't you show him the evidence we've got?
Umm, I accidentally pressed the buzzer earlier...
Umm... Let's get back to talking about the night of the murder, OK? Is it true that the buzzer didn't go off that night?
Do you think you could take just one more look for me? Pretty please?
What do you think, Nick?
Wh-What is it? What's wrong?
Huh? B-But how...?
1 AM...? Th-That's when the m-murder happened!
Yeah... He's like a totally different person...
...I think I could actually learn to like this new Larry.
Burgers!? I love burgers, too!
Umm, so what about for this...?
Uh, no. Sorry. This is a blackmail letter.
Huh?
Didn't we show him this letter yesterday, too? I'm pretty sure we did...
You found it when you snuck out of work to get socked in the kisser, right?
Larry... You really do feel bad, don't you?
Don't forget, Nick! Half-full!
Nnngh...
Umm... The buzzer in the CEO's office is directly connected to this room, right?
...Huh?
Wow... That was pretty good.
Yes, please! Please tell us!
Wh-What are you going on about, Larry!?
Huh? Well, I guess so...
You're so right about that!
Really? Like, what did he ask?
Huh?
Larry, when exactly does this "future" of yours start?
Huh? Really?
I see...
What is it, Nick?
Larry's your stereotypical guy, alright.
Mr. DeLite... Did they finish their interrogation?
That was a quick response...
B-But listen, Mr. DeLite! At the trial today, we learned the true identity of the thief, didn't we!?
Of course not. After all, you were at KB Security at the time.
...It's gotta be Detective Atmey.
Alright... What happened next?
Was it Kane Bullard that hit you...?
OK... And what did you do after that?
Nick... All of a sudden, Mr. DeLite kinda sounds like the murderer to me...
Mr. DeLite, is it true that one year ago... ...you were forced to quit KB Security?
D-Don't worry. We haven't told anyone yet...
Why have you been hiding it from her anyway?
Knowing that, why did you become a thief in the first place?
This blackmail letter... Is this the first one you got?
So someone found out about your true identity? Just like that?
P-Plans...?
What are these "plans" you're talking about?
So you mean that the one who planned the heists wasn't you...?
It sounds like Mr. DeLite is thankful to the person that was blackmailing him.
So you went after the Sacred Urn because of one of those plans, too?
What is?
What about Detective Atmey...? Could he be the one that sent it?
Oh yeah? It's one of our most valuable treasures!
Um, OK, I guess... Just promise me you won't steal anything, OK?
This photo... This has got to be the real Mask☆DeMasque!
So then... I guess it really is Detective Atmey, after all.
So was this blackmail letter written by KB Security's CEO, Kane Bullard?
The no one else other than Mr. Bullard could've have written the letter...
With the blackmail letter...?
Yeah, I actually bought this publicity photo!
Yes! Please! Please!
Are you sure that's the value of the stolen items?
Hee hee. Sorry. I just love making a lot of noise.
But Mask☆DeMasque... He must have gottn away, right? It says in the article that he "disappeared"...
Wow... Awesome! ...Hey, hold the phone! The guard in this photo... Is that you, Mr. DeLite?
That must have been really time-consuming, huh?
B-Blackmail letters!?
The buzzer went off just once around the time that Bullard was killed.
So then how do you explain Detective Atmey's crazy confession...?
That doesn't sound right coming from a thief, if you know what I mean...
Wh-Why do you say that?
Yeah, but I thought that you weren't the one who stole my urn...
It doesn't suit you at all!
What? Gumshoe cried!? Really!? Was it a single manly tear or did he let loose and sob?
...That must've been one heck of a beautiful scene.
Oh yeah? I admire you for doing your homework, if for nothing else.
Yeah, I guess you really can't say goofy stuff like that unless you're a master thief. "Farewell" or "We shall meet again"... You know, hokey stuff like that.
Yes, but... He made a pretty stunning confession in court today. "It was me all along! I am Mask☆DeMasque!"...
Do you have any idea why that is, Mr. DeLite?
I didn't really catch that.
Um, why?
Hmm... I guess so. You're really clever, Mr. DeLite.
Hey...! Pearly!
And? And? What did you find out?
Whew! That's a relief! I was really worried!
Problem?
What's the big deal!? We've gotta find out how they got there! That's the big deal!
Nick! Let's look around one more time!
That's the box that the Sacred Urn was in!
And it's definitely the same color as the stuff on the urn!
Alright! Let's investigate again, Nick!
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
Ah! That's the box the Sacred Urn was in...!
Wow, you're right! Look! It matches!
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
Ah! That's the box the Sacred Urn was in...!
Wow, you're right! Look! It matches!
See? We got our Sacred Urn back.
... That has to be the most pathetic acting I have ever seen in my life.
Well... That's not so hard to understand. Is it, Pearly?
...Hmm. I can totally see how that could've happened.
And that's when the "I AM" got changed to "AMI"?
But... There's something I don't get... When we first came here, I didn't see any paint stains.
A-And?
I see... Now it makes perfect sense.
Well then who was it? Who would have done it and why...?
Wh-Why? Why do you think so, Nick?
Hey! Nick!
You won't believe how many people are here for the trial!
What are you talking about? They're here for the trial next door!
Why don't you know this, Nick? *sigh* They're having Detective Atmey's trial today!
They say they're going to try him as Mask☆DeMasque.
Boy, I'd love to see Mask☆DeMasque's trial.
Oh, she went back home. She said she can't neglect her training anymore.
Yeah... Ever since... ...that incident last year.
...Oh, Mr. DeLite! Good morning!
Come on, don't be silly! ... W-Wait a sec!
Do you think there's a connection between the thief and the murder, Nick?
Huh? How come? Let's just take our time like always.
...?
*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...
You'd never know that from the way he's chugging it down.
Wow Nick, you kind of look like a politican, planning out your next move...
What is it, Nick?
But didn't you just say he might!?
Don't try to get out of this by acting all cool!
Not exactly the best hobby in the world, huh, Nick?
What is it, Nick? You don't look so good.
...He sure told you.
So Ms. DeLite doesn't know that her husband was fired, does she?
I'm not sure what to think about couples who keep secrets like that from each other.
Hmm... There wasn't much to his testimony, was there?
Uh oh. I've got a bad feeling about this... We'd better be careful.
Yeah...
What do you think, Nick?
...His dodging all of our questions is NOT helping us win his case.
I don't think Mr. DeLite even grasped what you were asking...
Nick! Did you know about this? He never told me this!
Hey, why aren't you doing anything?
... I guess I should prepare myself for the worst, too.
His metaphor this time was really obscure...
What is it, Nick?
Under "those circumstances"? What circumstances...? ...Oh! Hey, Nick! If you think his behavior was so strange... ...why don't you present some evidence that would show just what those circumstances were!
We heard this from Mr. DeLite yesterday, didn't we?
I betcha he's still hiding something.
I just hope he doesn't make things any more complicated...
Come on, Nick! If you can't prove that the "real killer was there"... ...this trial is as good as finished!
Is it really?
Oof... Guess there goes your chance to become an "Ace Detective".
Creepy... You sound like Detective Atmey...
I wonder what blend number crow-flavored coffee is?
They're on to you, Nick!
And Mr. DeLite just happened to waltz in when the murder was taking place, right?
Even though security was supposed to respond right away if the buzzer was pressed.
Because he was getting his clock cleaned at the time...
Actually you've been made to do a spit-take... with a cup of coffee.
Nick! You mean the real killer is...!?
But, but! Who is it?
Ah! That's right! She was at the police station! For almost the entire night!
It looks like you'd better think again.
H-Hang on, Nick! Are you saying this is the person who tried to frame Mr. DeLite for the murder?
Did they even know that Mr. DeLite was Mask☆DeMasque?
...My sis?
So then, she's still alive... inside your heart.
Not to mention, we don't exactly know his motive. I mean, why would Detective Atmey want to kill Kane Bullard...?
I think he's trying to say that you're full of it, Nick.
That penalty is probably boiling hot, too...
Then there really was an accomplice!
Hmm... I don't have any idea right now either.
Hey, Nick... Isn't there something odd about this?
Detective Atmey was always proud of his "Ace Detective" skills, right? But if the urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor while he was the only one watching it... ...he'd have no way to maintain his perfect "Ace Detective" persona.
Hey, Nick. I've been thinking...
This photo was taken in that basement warehouse, right? And if this was taken on the same night as when we went to see the Treasure Exhibit... ...then there's one thing here that doesn't add up.
So, this alibi is false?
But... I'm not really spotting anything unusual.
C-Can you do it, Nick?
What are you doing, Nick!? You need to think about why that statue was moved!
The question is why was the statue moved, right?
Um, I think you've got your "points" mixed up with your other "points"...
That's pretty much all stuff we've heard befroe, isn't it?
I guess Mr. DeLite didn't make this after all.
Hey, Nick. If this photo is a fake... Detective Atmey might have stolen the urn whenever this was taken.
Hmmm... Not a lot to go on, is there?
Alright then... How do we do that?
We need to prove that he's lying...
Um, Nick, I think it's still a little early for a victory pose.
N-Nick! He's getting his second wind!
That was an unusually reasonable deduction.
Aww. I was looking forward to one of his long-winded stories!
What's up, Nick?
Whoa... Do you have any evidence of that?
I thought he was actually pretty convincing.
So you're going to try to connect Detective Atmey to Mr. Bullard, right?
In that case, you'll have to talk about the blackmail...
Since we don't have enough information, you should press him for more testimony!
Well? That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Nick!?
I could laugh... if I tried.
Nick! Come on, stand up to him!
This is what it all comes down to, Nick!
Come on Nick... Are you even trying anymore?
Come on, Nick! Wasn't Mr. DeLite the one who was actually Mask☆DeMasque?
Ugh... You have to admit, that does sound a little odd...
That was... quite a performance by Mr. Atmey...
You don't get much more in your face than that...
B-But...! Can you really prove that?
Come on, Nick! Don't give up now!
D-Don't give up now, Nick! We still have tomorrow! We can look for more evidence and...
Huh? Wh-Why!?
"Double Jeopardy"...?
No way...
Come on! Just be happy already!
You've been cleared of the murder charges and got off as Mask☆DeMasque to boot!
...Huh? What do you mean?
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?
You'll be fine! And Nick can prove it!
Ms. DeLite... What are you going to do now that you know? Y-You're not going to really leave him, are you?
Chivalrous...?
Wait...! Mr. DeLite!
He's gone...
W-Well...

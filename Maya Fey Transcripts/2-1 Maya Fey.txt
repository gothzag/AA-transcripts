So!? So!? How's it going!?
Oh? And what if I said that everything will be fine? That's right! It's Maya to the rescue with the ultra-decisive super-important evidence! Here you are, Nick! The thing you wanted me to bring!
It was kind of tough, but I managed to find out some dirt! It looks like these guys are up to no good.
There's a group of con artists the police are currently investigating. I think these guys are members of that group.
Don't look at me!
Whaaaaat!? Why are you asking that!? You're the one who asked me to look this up yesterday!
These numbers were in the memory of that phone Maggey found.
You're awfully forgetful these days, Nick. I hope I never get to be a forgetful old prune like you!
Oh, oops! Guess you have to get going! We can talk about you being old later, Nick!
Come on, Nick. Better get a move on!
Wh-What is he? A human chatterbox?
Decisive!? Nick, did you hear what he just said!?
That's all you have to say? How can you be so calm!?
You mean Maggey?
Wow, that's pretty impressive. Hey, Nick! Do you think he's figured out what I do?
That's really strange. Maggey never mentioned anything about a bunch of bananas. That's it, Nick! He's gotta be lying about the bananas!
Well, maybe he thought he was seeing one thing, and it was something else...?
Which means if we can somehow show he's lying...
Is everything OK, Nick...?
Uh, Nick... I hope you've noticed the icy glares we're getting from everyone in here!
Uh, Nick... I hope you've noticed the icy glares we're getting from everyone in here!
Hey, Nick. I think you should take a look at the Court Record for a sec.
Why don't you take one more look at the Court Record?
Nick! That cell phone! Could it be...?
Nick!? What do you think you're doing!? You really should check out this lead!
Hmm, looks like he's got his phone. And I thought that just maybe this was his.
Wait, wait, wait! What is with you today, Nick!? Take a good look at the Court Record!!
I don't get it at all! Why do you think he wouldn't need to look for a phone in the first place!?
Then why don't you hurry up and present that piece of evidence!?
Then I bet this phone really is his, Nick! He must've killed Dustin to get his phone back!
Hmm... But if he wasn't looking for his cell phone, was he looking for something else...?
Nick! You have to do something before it's too late!!
Did you figure it out, Nick!?
Yeah! This is so exciting, watching you work again!
Nick! You can't let this slimebag get away! Think harder!
Are you sure, Nick!?
Yeah, but...
What in the world are you saying, Nick!? If he was just looking into the group, then he has no reason to kill anyone!
Hold on, Nick! What are you talking about!? If that's true, then he doesn't have a motive to kill Dustin Prince!
Then maybe we should be thinking outside the box!
Uuugh! That guy is really creeping me out--
Nick! Don't you remember!? When you got that from Maggey, you wiped it off!
You said there was sand all over it, so...
Pretty thoroughly, too...
Nick! We've worked so hard to get this far, but if you don't do something quick, he's going to get off scot-free!
What are you mumbling about!? You're... Well, you're YOU, Nick! And because you're you, you can't give up now!
That's easy! For starters, you'd raise your voice and object!
Alright, Nick!
...
Ouch... Talk about a tongue-lashing, Nick...
Hmm? You wrote your cell phone number on the back, but...
Huh? Right now!? But court is still in session!
OK, if you say so.
I feel really bad for Dustin. He didn't do anything to deserve this...
Your whole life? It couldn't have been that bad, could it?
"Lady Luckless"...
What do you mean?
... Oh.
That's not true!
Oh, I see...
OK! Good luck to you!
But you're OK, and that's what counts. You really had me worried! Come on, let's go back to the office.
What!? I thought you said you got your memory back!
You... You finally remembered!
Earth to Nick! What's wrong? You keep staring at me! Don't tell me you've missed me?
Oh? Well, I'm back now. So it's time for us to create new memories together!
Come on, Nick! Let's go to our usual burger joint!

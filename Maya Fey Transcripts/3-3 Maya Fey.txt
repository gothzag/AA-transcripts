Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!
So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! "Take on the world!" What do you think?
Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board Game.
Happy New Year, Detective!
Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!
Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective?
Yay! Thanks!
Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?
Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?
Hey, I wanna see! "Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced."
Listen to this! "Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case."
Which makes it old news, you mean.
Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?
No way. You don't mean...
A phony Nick!?
Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!
Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...
Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!
... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.
So, what's our first move?
Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right?
Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean.
Ah! Nick! I've got it!
...Spoilsport.
Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me?
I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something.
Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick!
Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you...
So you've still got that badge, I see.
Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.
I can't believe you've got an impersonator.
Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people imperonating them!
...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick?
Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day.
Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?
It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that.
We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis...
No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her.
So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh?
Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter.
Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it?
Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears!
Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object.
Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual.
It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?
He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!
Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?
Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!
She's not an "it", Nick. She's a "she", right Chief?
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.
This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?
Aah! You're... Are you...?
You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.
I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...
So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform.
Oh. I'm sorry.
So, what do you do now?
A waitress!?
"Treh Bee-an"...?
Oh...
Hey, hold on there, Maggey.
You keep calling the guy, "the victim". Didn't you know the guy who was killed?
Oh...
So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted?
Saw what?
What?
WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!?
In music? How come?
An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all?
Maybe it was "MC Screwdriver"!
And what about the killer? What did he look like?
She... She bit into it...
Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too?
Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool...
How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter?
This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder...
Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook.
Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned.
Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all.
You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey?
Wow! All those phrases are named after you?
You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey?
"Tough old byrde", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it?
Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey!
Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!
We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!
Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!
Wow! Look at this place.
Actually, I'm not all that into it...
... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.
Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!
Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money.
Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here.
... I never knew you were so... cultured.
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? I'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then.
...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. "MC Bomber", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe?
WHAT!?
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it?
Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?
What do you think this flower is, Nick?
Duh. Even I could've told you that.
Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.
Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.
I guess so, with all this police tape all around it.
Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know!
Hmm... "MC Bomber"...
There's something about that name, "MC Bomber".
Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess.
Anyway, we should really look into this some more!
This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh?
Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers!
And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid.
Then maybe one of the customers left it behind?
I guess it wasn't "MC Screwdriver" after all, huh...
If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! "The Master of Kurain" or "The Spirit Song" or even "Maya's Theme"!
You're right!
I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick?
Oh! Hel... lo... ...
Huh? "Bee Avenue"?
Huh? Me?
You think I need what...?
Really?
I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp...
I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you?
So what does "Trés Bien" mean? I know "trés". That means "three", right?
Oh. Very good...
A roaming what?
He was dead?
I see...
What!? Someone else saw it?
But Maggey swears there were two people!
Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!?
Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive!
So please! Tell us anything you know.
No way! What are we going to do, Nick?
Wh-What's wrong?
Huh?
WHAT!?
I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK?
Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick!
Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been...
Do you have any idea which customer it was?
Who, me?
Um... Sure!
That's my sister!
I do?
Do I look like I need cheering up or something?
Oh... You know about that?
Something like what?
Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive?
Wow! In Paris!?
Nick! Don't just make something up!
Huh? "'Im"?
Thank you!
Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!
So this is Vitamin Square.
Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?
He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons.
I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe!
Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do.
It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then!
No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them?
This place is so fruity!
Then that apple slide is perfect for you!
Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo!
Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too.
Hey, look. Pigeons!
Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace?
... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony?
Ooh, there's a magazine here.
Looking at this orange reminds me...
That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know.
Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien.
A disgrace?
What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing.
Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts...
Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir?
It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there?
He must be hiding something, right?
Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else!
Um, Maggey...
Really? Me?
What secrets...?
Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now!
So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?
So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?
Y-Yes?
What!? N-No, no. I was just...
...Different?
N-Nick! HEEEEEELP!
Oh, it's just you, Nick.
Well? How do I look?
Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer.
Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat!
I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that.
Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my "gimme a tip" smile!
Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says.
It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course.
What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register!
Yeah, right! Maybe later.
Oh! A fine choice, sir.
KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT!
Just a moment, please, sir.
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!
A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit!
Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already!
Well?
I'm starving!
Really!? ... Urp!
... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets!
Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen?
In the kitchen? Hmm. That sounds tasty!
What is it? I'm pretty busy right now.
Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face...
Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me.
And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually.
Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop!
Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty.
Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it?
Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK?
Huh? That's it!?
Wow! Look at all these little bottles!
Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute...
There's one bottle that's different from all the others.
And... *sniff* It doesn't smell.
Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he?
Wow! Look at all these little bottles!
Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too.
I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those.
Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that?
My Magatama! What's it doing here!?
Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that?
And look at these knives. They look really sharp!
A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick.
Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette.
Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of.
Oh, it's that old man... Is he still feeding the pigeons?
Ooh, ouch!
Huh? Me? Why?
Sure, OK. I'll just get changed.
... I guess...?
?
Uh, Nick. His eyes are burning into me!
P-Play on the silde?
And you're looking tired as usual, Detective Gumshoe!
Is is just me or did the room get darker all of a sudden...? You know, Detective. This is the year of the, um... gum!
Yeah. ...I think.
Look at that. He perked up in no time!
I guess it's about time to wrap up today's investigation.
Yeah. Plus, no one came to the restaurant...
I-I'm sorry...
That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know!
Huh? But, it said, "lobster" right on the menu.
Oh. It's only inspired, is it?
Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick.
He's not even looking at it.
I think I've got the hang of it now... But I think it's time for me to...
No way! You mean, the first customer you ever had!?
...?
What?
How could you do that, Mr. Armstrong!? Maggey was arrested because of you!
But you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket!
Huh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot!
But, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion...
So... the ticket he took was worthless?
Nngh...
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Hey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?
So you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?
Looks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?
I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.
If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.
Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how "one of them had some sort of earpiece".
If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.
This isn't going very well, is it...?
If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.
How much is too much?
0.2 grams? How much is that?
Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...
If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.
You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?
But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?
Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.
Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...
Looks like we're off course again, Nick.
I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.
Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!
Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!
Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!
Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!
Yay! Good job, Nick!
Phew! That was close!
No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.
Huh?
So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?
Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?
Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.
Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!
The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer!
This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not...
Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?
But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...
Hey! Did I just say something clever?
That's what we have to figure out, Nick!
He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...
How are we going to handle this, Nick?
Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?
Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick!
Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway...
I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?
Well, Nick? What do you think?
Then chuck evidence at him unyil he breaks!
I can't believe this is happening...
Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?
Come on, Nick! Nail him!
It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, "I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!"
Wow, Nick! You did it!
Godot's really mad, huh?
What the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...?
So how do you think the trial went this morning?
It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances.
All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon.
Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus.
Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty!
Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first.
Yeah, that's true.
Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too.
Actually, there is something...
I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff.
Huh? You did? What did you find out?
That badge is totally useless, Nick.
I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge!
Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a "fugazzi"!
Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick?
This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right?
I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it.
I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around.
Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick.
Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey.
That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck!
Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too!
A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt.
Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set?
A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet.
So? What's it say? ..."I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry."? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too.
That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it?
But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand...
Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too.
So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one!
Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed "Paths to Wealth"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, "Buy lottery tickets whenever possible."
It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far.
I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either...
I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket.
Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a found!
"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic". Hmm... I guess if your eardrm was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh?
The medication in the bag is missing too, right?
Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?
Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better.
Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there!
A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh?
That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out!
Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example.
We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers!
I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner.
Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all.
It's the seedy old man! What's his name again?
Better stay away from him a while, huh?
The chef's a witness too, right?
Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh?
Looks like Gumshoe's not here.
You think?
Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh?
Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief!
Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!
She's not an "it", Nick. She's a "she"! Right, Chief?
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Um... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.
But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey!
Empty, as usual.
He's getting really worked up about something.
What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe?
Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here!
It could say "Entrance" or "Exit", too. Did you think of that?
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?
Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court?
I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly.
Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.
Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.
Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee.
You really drove her into a corner, you know.
Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese!
Well, um... How did she put it again...?
Something like that.
P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean...
He's banging his head against the wall, Nick!
So? How did it taste!?
Delicate?
What's the matter with him?
Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set!
Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here?
So what were you all excited about eariler?
Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to?
Then why are there tears in your eyes...?
Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio.
You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean.
What is it?
Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop!
...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper.
Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup?
It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right?
That's because everyone wants money.
Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick.
Of course! So you'd better pay up!
Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up?
Yeah, thanks to you.
You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you?
Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right?
What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!?
Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun?
His workplace? Where's that?
Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go!
We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff.
Really? Like what part?
Ah! You're right!
Yeah, that's the impression I got, too!
What's in it?
Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out!
So? How did it go?
I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.
"Millionaire Radio"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick!
Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you?
Hey, check this out...
Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle!
Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope!
Looking at this orange reminds me...
That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know.
OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe?
Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to "Fair Maiden"!
Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone.
Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette.
Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like.
That's what girls do, Nick!
Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry!
So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful.
And she likes raw meat and fires, right?
You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens!
Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money.
Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much!
I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case...
Um... Who's this he?
The Tiger?
Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars...
Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind!
I-It's not a block of cheese, you know!
Does that mean something to you?
But we found it behind your magazine rack...
That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know!
Huh? But, it said, "lobster" right on the menu.
Oh. It's "inspired", is it?
Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick.
What is it?
An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it...
Help them? With what?
Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman!
Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right?
Who, me?
Um... Sure!
Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back.
Superhumanly...?
Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air!
Oh, umm... Hello...
Wow! What secrets!?
Understood!
That's an* DMH, right?
Then do you write programs, too?
They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one!
Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for...
Futuristic?
... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling.
Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it?
That explains why we don't use the computer in our office!
Yeah, but at least I'm...
She said she'd laugh at us, Nick.
This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? You're hopeless, Nick. You know what?
Wow! I bet that's where the "pro" in "programmer" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that.
Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice.
Wow! Look at this mess!
What kind of betting tickets?
Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these...
This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? You're hopeless, Nick. You know what?
Wow! Look at this mess!
What kind of betting tickets?
Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these...
Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess!
But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this.
...!
Hey! This calender...
Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen!
Yeah. Umm... It says, "Meet with The Tiger."
Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess!
But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this.
...!
Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management.
CDs...?
Y-Y-Yeah...
Can you tell us anything that might be helpful?
Oh...
I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets.
She just gave us the dreaded "professional, business-like cold-shoulder", huh?
Oh? Like what?
What's the matter?
Umm, would you mind taking a look at this?
SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness!
A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame!
If it's not "sesame", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is.
Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say?
About Maggey's case, you mean?
OK. Well, see you later then.
What is it?
Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat.
Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry!
...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it?
She's gone! Just like that!
But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK?
Of course! No one will ever know...
Aaaaaaaah!
N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here!
It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that.
I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled!
I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting!
What's this?
What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that!
The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a "punching"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Trés Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing.
The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into.
Aaaaaaaah!
... *gulp*
Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast...
What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger?
WHAT!?
Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal!
The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into.
Aaaaaaaah!
... *gulp*
Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast...
Let's see... This round doll thing is called a "daruma"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering.
Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove!
Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a "king"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know.
Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here.
The car's registered to... the "Cadaverinis"?
I wonder what that's supposed to mean...
Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me...
Aaaaaaaah!
Oh?
O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...?
Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up.
I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal.
Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too!
What is it?
Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out.
Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up.

Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic!
Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick.
Aaaaaaaah!
N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this!
Aaaaaaaah!
Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks...
S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said!
Aah! I'm scared, Nick!
Look, on the lapel of this suit...
Is The Tiger a lawyer!?
For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick.
Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic!
Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick.
Aaaaaaaah!
N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this!
Aaaaaaaah!
Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks...
S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said!
Aah! I'm scared, Nick!
Aaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaah!
...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him.
Aaaaaaaah!
Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan?
Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well!
Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident.
F-Furio...
Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him!
You d-died!?
Everything!?
No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe.
Operation?
A f-f-fatal injury!?
Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick!
Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine!
S-Sure...?
Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours!
There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again!
What? Why? Hellooo, old man!
Hey, he just turned his back on us!
Hey, Mr. Kudo!
Look, we really need to talk to you, alright?
Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful...
We hear you...
W-We're really sorry...
Um... You said you were a craftsman, right?
S-Surely it's not that...
Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself.
Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...?
What!? I never said that!
He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint...
Errands?
Um, well...
So, did you end up calling the police?
You went looking for one...?
F-Five minutes...?
Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...?
What do you mean?
Ah!
So, did you end up calling the police?
You went looking for one...?
F-Five minutes...?
Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again.
Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me!
Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most.
Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there.
Huh? What do you mean?
Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered?
So you really think it was this "disappearing man" that did it...?
Oh, yeah. The "MC Screwdriver" album, right?
Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me!
Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police.
We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day.
...? "Doesn't quite" what?
OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man!
Are you sure, Maggey!?
So? What did this woman look like?
"Cackling"?
That's what we think, madam.
It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it?
Was it that bad?
Oh, ouch.
He's not really that bad of an old man though.
Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better...
That's right! You could never do anything like that!
Th-That's right!
But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how...
Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself.
Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid...
Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you?
He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too!
O-Oh... really?
B-But...
But! ...I guess so.
Huh?
But it's a completely different color!
He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y--
I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help...
Huh?
Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall!
Wow! This place is really buzzing.
Detective Gumshoe!
Why? What's going on?
He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash!
Y-Yes!
Um... OK...?
Really?
Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick?
So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe?
What?
Well, Nick? Do you?
Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick!
Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright?
So the inside goes "boom", right?
Whoa! That's scary.
Infectious?
But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that?
What!? That's horrible!
Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong.
Who are they?
All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie!
So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then?
Tight?
Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!?
WHAT!?
What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!?
She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she?
Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick?
Is he famous?
You're shaking, Detective.
Why not?
You're shaking, Detective.
You remember. The weenies...?
Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious!
Umm... Well... Not exactly...
Oh...
...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too...
I really can't eat any more...
But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention centre, right...?
Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Trés Bien!?
Use the trash can, Nick!
I thought I saw something suspicious under the corner of that rug!
Oh! Really?
A... A... A million bucks!?
"Compensation", huh...?
Wow. I'm so sorry.
You helped him? In what way?
Wow, I feel so bad for Viola.
Huh?
Is everything alright, Nick?
Yeah.
Mr. Armstrong...
Ah! It's Xin Eohp...
Aaaaah!
Wait, Nick! Don't leave me behind!
Good morning, Maggey!
Are you OK, Nick?
It's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.
Huh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?
Wow! Look at all these little bottles!
Hey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.
And... *sniff* It doesn't smell.
So!? What is it? Is it the poison?
Medication?
It's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?
We need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?
I do not have a topknot!
Hey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...
If he saw everything he described relfected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the "left" was actually on the "right", huh.
Do you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?
But that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!
Wow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!
Bad luck, Nick. Looks like the "boil" of a contradiction you found is just a "rash".
I bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.
So that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.
G-Godot actually laughed at something!
It is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.
...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?
What do you mean?
Is that the best you can come up with, Nick?
This is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!
It's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.
H-He's even humming a song to himself...!
I guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?
But if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?
Ah! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?
Wh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?
Come on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!
Maggey was telling the truth!
You'll just have to put the words in his mouth, Nick.
And a bit too male!
He's already confessed this much! He might as well stop dancing around the real issue!
Then sock it to him, Nick!
Mr. Armstrong...
So we're finally going to see The Tiger on the stand! We've almost got this case won now, Nick.
Huh?
You mean, you think Mr. Armstrong was lying?
What are you so jumpy about, Detective!? Your hair's standing on end!
It's not a topknot!
But, Nick! We still don't have a really decisive piece of evidence, right?
What are you doing, Nick!? If Detective Gumshoe's going to check some prints for us, shouldn't he be checking this?
Look, it even says, "covered in unidentified fingerprints" right in the Court Record!
So you'll look into it for us? Awesome!
It's time to separate the phonies from the real guys!
Aaaaaaaah!
Don't let him get the better of you, Nick!
Get a grip, Nick!
You can do it, Nick!
Wow, The Tiger's a really good salesman, huh?
How about you hit him with a fat piece of evidence, boss?
He said that just like Viola, didn't he?
Just think! All you have to do is press him on something irrelevant, and bam! $50,000!
Hey! I'm no idiot, you know!
But his testimony is pretty solid as it is...
Did you hear that, Nick? He said you're not bad!
Do you think he really didn't meet Glen Elg?
So you mean... that whole testimony he just gave was a lie?
Well, Nick? What do you think?
Be careful what you press him on, though, or you'll get penalized, OK?
Better think again while he's down there, Nick.
Better think again while he's down there, Nick.
Stop shaking, Nick!
Nick, would anyone really ever loan money to someone they thought was unreliable? Like, for example, if it were you, I'd only loan you five bucks, max.
That's a real heavyweight punch!
Sounds like Mr. Elg was in a real sticky spot.
Don't be tempted, Nick! You haven't got the will-power for it!
A-Are you alright, Nick?
Do you know where you're going with this, Nick?
Outside the box?
A-Are you alright, Nick?
So The Tiger was meeting Glen Elg to get his money back. If Mr. Elg had just given him the lottery ticket, that would have been the end of it.
But we've come so far!
Oh! So? Do you know who the prints belong to now?
So? Tell us! They're The Tiger's right? I knew it!
That's great! We've got him now, Nick!
What's wrong with you!? You've hardly said a word since Detective Gumshoe got here. He's laid everything on the line for this, Nick.
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself...
M-Maggey!
Isn't there anything we can do now, Nick?
Come on, Nick! Don't let Gumshoe down!
W-Wait a minute, Nick! Aromatherapy oil's not going to help anyone now, is it!?
What are you doing, Nick!? What did you just tell Gumshoe and I outside in the lobby a few minutes ago? You said, "The fact that his prints are on this bottle makes no difference now!"
Congratulations, Maggey!
Look, Nick! In the doorway!
Maggey! Why are you being so hard on him? He busted his butt for you! It's thanks to him that we got the medication bottle...
But...
Looks like she still isn't ready to forgive him. Can't you put in a good word for him, Nick?
He said you lost weight and he was worried about you.
Did you guys hear that!? I'm pretty hungry myself, you know.
So? How is it, Maggey?
Good things are going to happen to you from now on, Maggey. I'm sure of it.

That rocked! "See you in Hell, Evil Magistrate!!!"
Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!
What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!
Umm... 10 years old?
Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-"teen." See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.
Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, "Steel Samurai" was no.1!
Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.
It'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!
N-N-Nick!!!
I-it's the Steel Samurai! The Steel Samurai got arrested!
Yes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!
Yeah, on TV!
No! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!
Just come to the office, quick! Please, Nick!
No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!
Yes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick! I-it's the Steel Samurai!
Yes... yes, of course! We'll be right there!
Let's go, Nick!
They have the Steel Samurai down in detention!
So, I've decided this will be our first case!
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
No! We just don't have enough information!
You like showing that off, don't you, Nick?
Sorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out...
...
Umm... Is that guy really him?
Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.
Y-yes!?
N-no! No!
D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.
Oh...
Nick!
He's a good guy! I mean, he's good!
He didn't do it!
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Wow! Nick! Let's go!
Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!
Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?
O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.
G-gawkers?
Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say "no."
No! You were a star!?
Wo... wow.
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.
N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Hey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio.
Yes, the Steel Samurai.
Hey, hey, Nick.
There were maps in the security guard station.
Well, time to go, Nick.
Aah! It's that confused detective!
Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!
Um, Detective?
Oh no! I... I'm sorry!
Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!
Um, well... We're on this case too, pal!
I'd say he's a character alright...
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Whaat!?
What! Who took that!?
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.
Oh well. Let's try again later.
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Look!
Let's take it, Nick!
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Nick... I'm hungry!
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out!
Let's go in and check it out, Nick!
Alright! We're in!
Hey, Detective! Take a look at this!
Aww... I just wanted to show it off.
...
...
Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Ready, Nick? Action!
What's this?
Huh.
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Look, a ladder!
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!
We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.
Don't worry, leave it to us!
Only one assistant!?
I see. Neat!
Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?
Ma'am?
Eek!
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.
Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!
No one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant?
Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!
What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!
You know how to work these things, Nick?
... ... Nothing happened.
*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?
... ... Nothing happened.
*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?
Hey! It printed out the data for that day!
How is this a picture of Will Powers?
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.
What does that mean?
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!
Why not?
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Not a bad idea...
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Nick, this is your chance!
Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?
Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?
Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?
Old windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.
How convenient.
Well, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this...
"Come to think of it"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?
Hmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.
Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!
So who was the "Steel Samurai" in that security photo?
What!? You should take better care of that stuff!
Nick! W-what are we going to do!?
Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!
Hey, Nick. It's time.
That kind of takes the legs out from under that case...
"Maybe"? "Maybe"!? How about "absolutely," Nick!
Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!
Nick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!
Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*
So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?
Neither do I, Nick.
Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.
Right! We'll be back to visit you soon...
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?
The director and producer...?
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
There's not enough information!
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Poor old WP...
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.
You can say that again!
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Huh...
Your costume was in your dressing room?
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
With duct tape. We heard.
No one's here.
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
This monkey head is real heavy!
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Probably so.
It says "Welcome."
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
I... don't really want to be in here.
I want to go someplace else. Nick?
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Huh.
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
This... is Studio Two?
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?
Hey... There's a trailer over there.
Are we sure this is a studio?
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Well, let's go for a drive!
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.
Nick! Let's go inside!
Aww... shucks.
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!
Right! See you later, then!
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Really, Nick? We can!?
Yeah... I guess so.
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
But we did take that cardkey...
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Wait... Nick!
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
So they were trying to protect the director?
H-huh!? W-we... Wait, you first! Who are you!? You look pretty suspicious to me!
R-really!? You're THE Sal Manella!? I'm so sorry! I, just, you looked so... Sorry!
W-what is it?
Rocksores!? Wh-wh-what... Hey! You're drooling!
Why's it gotta be "Little" Olde Tokyo!? Why can't it have a cool name, like "Neo Olde Tokyo"!?
H-hey! Nick!
Th-the snacks! There was twice this much here before!
...
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
W-why are you staring at me like that...?
Eek! N-N-Nick! W-w-what was that noise!? It sounded like it came from inside the trailer...
H-Hello? ...
Pretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in!
What? Don't we have a key?
Then what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it!
Eeeek!
You sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips.
N-Nick! Look at her eyes! She's serious!
Hey! H-hey! Wait!
Hey, um, kiddy-o! What's yer name, sport?
H-huh!? But you... You are a kid! What a rude little brat. That's no way to talk to an adult!
H-hippie fashion...? Nick... I think I'm being mocked.
What do you mean? We're on the Steel Samurai's side!
Okay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8?
Hmph... not bad, kiddy-o.
You were here, weren't you?
What!?
Wha--!? Wait...
... He's gone. Huh? Something fell off the table when he bumped into it on his way out.
He "saw everything"...
Huh? Where's that old windbag?
Nick! That was her!
Uh oh, she tripped!
Hey, hey, Nick. Now's our chance! Let's check out the guard station!
... Oh! This is it, Nick! The "Trailer Key"!
We'll be borrowing this, right, Nick?
Great! Let's go, Nick!
Well, you first, Nick!
Eek! S-someone's in here!
O-our n-names? Um, w-we're WP's lawyers, and, um...
A-and who might you...?
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great!
Umm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder?
...
Um, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai!
N-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her!
Nick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird?
Nick, let's get out of here. Isn't there someplace else we have to check?
W-why do we have to do your errands...!
...
I... I don't think I like her. *sniff*
Nick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been.
We're back at the scene of the crime. Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick.
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these.
Ahah! Found it, Nick! The script!
Is that producer really that scary?
...! Just you hold on! What's the big idea!? Who do you think you are anyway!? And, and do you even know who we are!?
Umm.... right.
N-no, it's just, well, no, but...
Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help.
Impossible? Why?
W-what!?
...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.
What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished!
What!?
Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.
So, what happened?
Wow! Good going, Nick!
"Initial trial"...? What's that?
So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?
What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?
B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?
What happened with the director's testimony?
Huh...
Really!? Why?
Whaaaat!?
I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything.
Maybe we should go talk to WP?
...?
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted!
Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV...
No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick?
Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days!
Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.
Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!
Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.
Yeah! Why?
*sigh* Gimme about three more years.
The old windbag sure is quiet today.
You know, this place is really... peaceful, like this.
Nick? I think her guard's down...
I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted.
Whew! She's alive!
Do you... not like the producer?
Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?
Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?
But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?
Say, Nick, how did you figure that out again?
Aww.
It says "Welcome."
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Hey, Nick... It's Ms. Vasquez! Hello?
H-E-L-L-O!

Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. ...
I don't know... I'm getting this funny feeling. Something about this just feels... odd, you know?
Don't get all teary eyed yet.
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer came here on the day of the murder, and...
?
Do something, Nick! She's really ticking me off!
Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai!
You... you did it! Nick! She did it! She's the killer! My Fey blood speaks to me! I know it! I know it!
Wh-why are you showing that to me, Nick?
... Wasn't the assistant cleaning up yesterday? Funny, it still seems pretty messy in here.
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
I guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time.
I guess... This is where you found that bottle of sleeping pills, right?
I wonder if there're any other clues lying around.
Eeek!
D-didn't mean...? I almost had a heart attack!
Ah, they've seen wisdom at last! They know if they fixed it I'd just kick it off again.
So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how?
Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for?
What do you think, Detective Gumshoe?
Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!
So that means...
You're being very... free with your information today, Detective.
...!
It must be tough being a detective, with all that responsibility...
Empty dressing rooms like this are kinda lonely, aren't they?
Y-yeah...
Wow! You remembered, Nick!
Well, we can be pretty sure WP did take a nap here, like he said.
I hope WP can come pick it up himself, soon.
A genius...?
And... what?
I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.
How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to "Samurai Summer."
What are you doing here?
Wha!? What!? Why!? But WP's innocent!
What!? Nooooooooooooooooo!
He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!
The rumor?
Some "dirt"? What dirt!
... Um, I know what dirt means...
W-what do you mean, the "last Steel Samurai"!?
No... no!
W-what!? Why!?
H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!
No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!
Neither do I, Nick.
S-someone died!?
And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?
I see...
Kids love the Steel Samurai.
The old windbag doesn't look so good...
She's starting to froth at the mouth, Nick... Maybe we should keep a safe distance?
Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. That assistant we talked to.
Nick... I'm kinda having trouble figuring that one out too.
Nick... I'm kinda having trouble figuring that one out too.
Nick... I'm kinda having trouble figuring that one out too.
Ms. Oldbag...?
I see...!
Ms. Oldbag...
Poor Ms. Oldbag...
Detective Gumshoe must have left by now.
I bet Edgeworth is pretty angry with him.
The assistant must have gone off somewhere. That stuff about Mr. Hammer must have come as a shock to her.
She means the security lady, Ms. Oldbag, Nick.
Nick. She went inside the trailer.
Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!
B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...!
B-but, the security lady said it was an accident!
W-what? This is valuable evidence!
Nooooooooooooo!
Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared...
Detective Gumshoe?
Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this.
Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!
This is the final battle, Nick! Let's do it!
Well, Nick? Find anything?
It's hard. I think she's pretty used to being the boss. But I'm sure you'll find some contradiction in what she said... somewhere!
Um, Nick... are you sure? I mean, I love steak, but even I don’t eat the bone!
Nick! Remember her testimony? She said she ate a "t-bone steak"! She said "bone"!
Yeah, sure, Nick.
Good luck, Nick!
Hey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?
I can sense it too, with my Fey blood...
Nick! Think about this some more!
Please! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?
Nick! Why did Edgeworth...?
But... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...
Okay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!
Hey... Hey, Nick. Why's everyone so quiet? Someone should do something to lighten things up!
You have to find something to peg this on her here... Or everything we've done till now will have been wasted! I believe in you, Nick! Go get 'em!
Nick! You're supposed to be putting her on the spot, not helping her out!
Quick! Start over!
Nick, no! Saying you can't prove it now would be admitting defeat! She'll get away!
I don't care if it's impossible, you still have to fight this one!
...! Why... are you showing that to me, Nick? And why are you whispering?
Huh. Well, I'm afraid your test results are negative.
Nick! We’re so close! Think this one through, please!
Um, Nick? You know that problem of yours? That problem where you present evidence that makes no sense? You're doing it again.
Congratulations, WP!
N-no! O-of course not... Aah! N-Nick! Edgeworth!
Meet "again"...?
What? Friends? As if! They’re rivals! Rivals! Right, Nick?
Huh!? Why do I get the feeling I'm missing something? C'mon, Nick! Tell me! What’s the deal with you and Edgeworth?
Nick! This is it! The new show starts today! You're going to watch it with me, right?
You have to buy trading cards too, okay! We have to trade with Cody and that assistant!
Isn't it great that WP gets to play the lead again? I wonder if they'll show his real face this time...

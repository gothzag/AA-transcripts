Hey, Nick.
You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?
But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?
Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!
"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!
It's at a spiritual retreat called "Hazakura Temple". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!
You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!
Yeah! And I signed up for the "Special Course"!
Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!
Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.
Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?
Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick?
Huh...?
Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?
Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!
W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!
P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!
Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!
Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--
B-B-B-Bikini...!?
It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your "Special Course"!
"Wa ha ha"...?
But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--
What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?
Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.
Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.
That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!
I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.
What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?
Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!
...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.
Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!
"Snow motorcycle things", "Snowblowmeal". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this "Slowmobile"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this "Blowsnowbile".
But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.
Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!
W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!
Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!
Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!
Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!
Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, "Dusty Bridge".
Well, it's practically the same thing.
I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?
But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? "I see dead people" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)
The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.
OK, I'll write, "wooden staircase" on it then.
Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?
Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!
OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.
"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge", huh?
C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be "Dusty"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!
I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?
Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?
Forgive him, Sister; for he knows not what he is saying.
Um, so what exactly is the "Special Course"...?
Eh...?
How am I supposed to "be careful"...?
"Iris"...?
Really? That kinda sounds like fu--
Inner Temple...?
Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!
Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!
What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?
Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...?
Who is she, Nick?
Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...
...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.
...I want a staff like that.
Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!
Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.
Oh, I'll help too, then...
Huh!? But...
Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!
Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go?
Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris?
...?
Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.
And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.
Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!
What's wrong with you? Your face is all green.
Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That "temple" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...
That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!
No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.
Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.
...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?
It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.
Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!
What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.
Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.
But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.
Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!
Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!
Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.
Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?
Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.
Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!
Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.
Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!
... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?
Looks like there's something written on it.
What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.
So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?
Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.
Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!
I wonder if that roast is ready yet?
Huh? What do you mean, "both"? I'm the only one.
Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.
Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.
Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...
...? Is something wrong?
I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?
... Not you too, Nick...
I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!
She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.
Nick?
...?
Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.
Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!
The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!
... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S.
Ha ha ha ha ha! ♪Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!♪
AAAAAAH!
Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother...
...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...
Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.
...
N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face.
I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School.
Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.
Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright?
Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet.
...? You think he's yelling at us?
Hey! I know you! You're...
So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.
A clean slate...?
The "book of destiny"...? Do you mean...?
Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!
Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady.
Wow! That's a beautiful photo!
...Talk about a bad case of denial.
It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.
Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!
Oh, really!?
Wow! You really do remember!
You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!
She seems really motherly, doesn't she?
...She's your WHAT!?
She's really pretty.
Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...?
"But"...?
Hey! Pearly!
Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!
Boy am I stuffed...
Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.
Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.
Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!
We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.
I signed up for your "Special Course"!
...Nick... ...Sis...
Maya Fey. My profession is... Umm... I'm the assistant manager at Wright & Co. Law Offices.
... I... I'm frightened. The Fey clan... I don't want any more to do with it.
... I, umm... I... I didn't see anyth--
Huh...?
B-But I...
...!
...Yes, Your Honor.
I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.
I-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...
Sorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!
I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.
Well, Sister Bikini of course! But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well.
Well, umm... Let me think...
No... I'm sure I didn't see her. She must have come while I was preparing for the training.
Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...
Ah... Well... I didn't see who it was... I was hit from behind.
Oh! L-Let me think for a sec... I'm sorry... I just can't remember.
Umm, well, let me think... It was... Uh... Oh yeah! That's right! It was dark, that's it!
It's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training.
I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.
My attacker was in front of me, blocking off my escape. ...I think.
After getting hit like that... I-I was in a state of panic. There were only two things rolling around in my mind at the time.
Umm... "My name is Maya Fey. One plus one equals two"...
You see, for some crazy reason, I was afraid I was going to lose my memory. I know it's odd considering my life was in danger, but that's how it was...
I think I screamed, "Help me!"
Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits!
I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope.
Umm... I think so. Now that I think about it... Yeah, that's gotta be what I screamed.
Oh. Um... OK.
Oh. Um... OK.
Um, what...? What do you mean by "your last hope"?
Huh? What? I said what?
Um, yeah.
Oh... Well, you know... That's like... What do you call it when that happens...
Oh, yeah. Umm, I... Oh! That's right! I remember now... I was facing my attacker, but that's not who I was screaming at.
Yeah, that's right... It was the person behind my attacker that I was yelling at. That's who I was screaming to for help! ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
I messed up! I didn't... I didn't mean to let that slip out...
Um, I am... Well... I uhh, I meant to keep that part a secret. Nngh... What have I done?
A ton of pressure...
I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.
W-Well... Y-You see... I-I couldn't see.
Well, you know... Lantern light isn't very bright.
There's a great big stone lantern in the garden! They always light it when an acolyte is there for training.
H-Hey! You know what they say... "Under the lantern, darkness reigns." So I could see the person that was further away, but not my attacker, who was closer! Plus, there weren't any other light sources in the garden at the time...
Then something warm splashed over me...
I didn't know it at the time, but... I... I think it was probably blood.
At that moment, I was paralyzed with fear... I was just sitting there in the snow. I'm sure blood got on everything around me.
That's when... I lost consciousness.
...I don't remember.
No... I haven't got any idea! Umm... I really don't know what happened at all!
Umm... yeah.
The killer...!
Umm...
H-Huh? What do you mean? What problem...?
Huh... What!?
N-No!
N-Nick...
Ah...!
N... NOOOOOOOOOO!
...... ... Please... Nick... I don't know anything... Please... I'm begging you...
N-No, Nick! Don't...! P-Please! Stop...!
...
... Y... You're wrong! I-I... I never saw that!
I thought the person that stabbed my mother was a man... ...for a totally different reason!
...Y-Yes, Your Honor. I didn't realize it until after I woke up, but...
...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.
Yes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...
...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.
Yes. I think... I think it happened when the v-victim was stabbed.
That's what I think, too.
By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...
Yes, I think so...
...... I... ...... I don't know.
Yes, I think so...
...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something.
Yes... I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake...
Everyone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden...
Yes. I'm sure of it.
Yes, Your Honor...
I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.
Well... If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right?
...
The torches were lit... And the body was gone.
Yes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed.
...
And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.
There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use.
Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered.
...But, I think this will help explain them!
Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...
Y-Yes.
... Nick... I'm sorry...
Ah...
......
......
Umm, Nick. I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but... If the killer had meant to put the blame on me... ...then why didn't the killer leave the crime scene as it was?
B-But... That doesn't make any sense! The torches were all lit and everything... There's no way any normal person would miss something as glaring as that!
W-Wait! Just wait a minute!
M-Mr. Godot... isn't the killer...! After all, he didn't even come to the Inner Temple... ...until 2 days after the murder took place! He didn't show up until after that old bridge got fixed up!
...!
Why...? What do you mean!? I may not look it, but I'm-- Eeeeeeeek!!
P-Please, Your Honor! Let me add to my testimony! ...Nick! Please listen to me...!
Yes, sir. After I woke up, I began channeling and my spirit "left me", as it were. But that little girl was there at the Inner Temple, too!
Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!
That's my little cousin! Pearl Fey.
Oh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.
Whaaaat!? Come on! Pearly would never tell a lie! She's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!
Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!
In the spare prep room next to the Training Hall, I guess. There's a rule that you can't enter the Training Hall during an acolyte's training.
She knew that the spiritual training I was about to undergo was very intense.
The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.
Well, you see... Pearly gets pretty scared when she's alone. And there weren't that many places to look... She says that she even went back and forth several times.
And there's also a storage shack, I think... That's about it.
... Well, if it was me, that would be the first place I would investigate!
The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.
What do you mean?
...Oh. Well, Pearly said she was sleeping at the time. She said she was so scared during the night... ...that she couldn't sleep well and woke up a bunch of times.
That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!
Yes! Then Mr. Godot...
He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!
That's what Pearly said... She said he was a very nice older gentleman. Thank you for looking after my cousin, Mr. Godot!
Really...?
P-Pearly...
Wh-Why do you say that!?
B-But! Mr. Godot is right! That scroll shows a picture of my mother!
Gravy...? But why gravy, Nick?
W-Wait a minute, Nick!
T-Take another look at the hanging scroll! Look! At the top...! There's a crest there!
Exactly! So if you know the meaning of the mark...
Oh...
Th-That's right! Otherwise there's no reason for him to sneak onto the crime scene...
Huh...?
Th-That's right! Mr. Godot couldn't have known where the instructions were hidden!
A visit?
...... I knew it... You've figured it out, haven't you, Nick...?
...!
That's terrible...
Th-That's so sad...
Huh? You mean me...?
B-But...! How did you contact my mother!? She had been missing for almost 20 years!
What!? What do you mean, officially!?
So my mother... was cooperating with you?
Sh-She was always...
M-Mother...
She was worried and followed me to the Inner Temple...
...!
Ah...! Whaaaaaaaat!?
N-No, Nick...! P-Please don't!
I... I heard the whole thing. From my sister... In the medical office...! That's why! That's why... I have to protect Mr. Godot...
I can't do it... I can't testify against him... After all... ...he's the man who put his life on the line to protect Mia... and me, too!
N-Nick...
...!
...... I understand. I'm sure you're right... I'm ready now, Nick...
...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.
I-I'm sorry... I thought I saw them, but then they disappeared all of a sudden...
...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.
...Yeah, you're right. I think I saw them, but... I can't say for certain... And I can't tell you for sure they were from Mr. Godot's mask either...
Yeah... I guess so. Maybe that's what I was thinking at the time... But... I can't remember. After all... ...there was a person I couldn't identify in front of me!
I thought I'd ask for help, but... just then I was splattered with blood!
I think so, probably. Just at that moment... ...I heard a soft scream that seemed to be close by. It was a woman's voice.
...
She wasn't dead though... And she struck back at the enemy behind her.
Well, you're right... I didn't see it exactly... But I could tell by the sounds of their breathing and movement. And also, the smell of blood.
I... I couldn't move. I could just barely make out their shadows moving in the dark, but... I had no idea what to do!
Y-Yes. I-I think so. But...
Suddenly, the red lights went out and the whole area was dark.
Y-Yes. Suddenly I couldn't see them at all.
Maybe the mask was damaged.
...Just at that moment, there was a horrible scream!
...Yes, that's right.
... I don't think so. I'm pretty sure... ...it was a man's voice.
I think... ...Dahlia Hawthorne must have taken the blade and attacked the killer with it.
After that, the killer stole the blade back and delivered the final blow... I guess.
Ah...! Is-Is that right...!?
Right after that... Dahlia collapsed and I lost consciousness.
...I'm sorry, I don't know. ... R-Really! It's true, Nick!
W-Wait a minute...!
Umm, I... I know I probably shouldn't say this, but... ...there's a big contradiction in Nick's explanation!
Th-This dagger... You said that it wounded the killer.
But... But, but...! If Mr. Godot had really been cut with the dagger... ...his clothes should be bloody or have a rip in them, right!?
What are you talking about? It's not that simple at all! Remember back to the day of the murder! Everyone that was on the Inner Temple side got trapped there!
...Mr. Godot was already there waiting for them! He never had a chance to change his clothes!
H-hidden...?
Mr. Godot...
Wh-What do you mean?
Wh-Who would that be...? Are you talking about Nick?
No... Why?
Huh...!?
...!
M-Mr. Armando! I believe in you! I know you were trying to save me!
M-Mr. Armando...
...Nick...
I guess it's just like my sis said...
That night, when I channeled Mia to get her advice on what to do... This is what she wrote back in my notebook. "Don't worry. Phoenix will save everyone in the end."
Come on! Cut it out with that gloomy face! Can't you see? Me, sis, and I'm sure Iris, too... We owe you for everything you have done for us, Nick!
Huh!? Mr. Edgeworth!? When did you get back?
Helping you...!?
Wow... But where were you, Nick?
Oh, ouch! Talk about embarrassing, Nick. You definitely need more training! Anyway, thank you, Mr. Edgeworth! And you too... um... Franziska!
Oh! Larry!
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?
...*glare*
Oh... I'll go look for her! Be right back!
Nick... What do I do...? Pearly... I can't find her anywhere!
I thought so too, so I called the village... But no one has heard from her! This has never happened before!
B-But... None of this was her fault! What... What should I do...?
Nick...!
B-But where should we look!? Where could Pearly have gone...?
Hazakura Temple...
Sister Bikini?
S-So she's here? Pearly is here...?
O-OK!
Pearly's not here...
Ah! Someone cleaned it off...
P-Pearly...! Why... Why did you just leave like that?
You don't have to do that, Pearly. It wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. Of course I'm sad that my mother is gone... But... how do I say this? I... I'm still happy.
No, really... It's true... The only reason I'm still here at all is thanks to everyone who was there for me.
My sis, my mother, Mr. Armando, Nick... And... you. If even one of you weren't there, I'm sure I wouldn't still be alive right now. That's why... I have to be strong. For all the people that were there for me when I needed them. That's all I can really do.
Sister Bikini...!
......
...?
Ah...! M... ...Mother...
Alright! I'm going to make a brand new start, too! Sister Bikini! I'll be back for more training! I promise!
Alright! We're going to have a great feast today, Pearly. You know why? Because training is a battle of endurance!
What is it, Nick?
Come on! What do you think? You're one of us, Nick! Next time you can train right alongside us!
It'll be great, Nick! We're going to do the Special Course, naturally!
We'll have a nice, big meal before we come next time! Right, Nick!?
Sure! Of course you can!
I'll really have to work extra hard now! Master of Kurain and the office manager of Wright & Co. Law Offices. And I have to be a good big sister to Pearly and Nick, too! Well, as long as I'm not locked up or captured or something like that.

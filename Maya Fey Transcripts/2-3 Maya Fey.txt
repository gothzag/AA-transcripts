Hehe... That was amazing! Wasn't it Pearly!?
Yeah! Max Galactica! He was absolutely fabulous!
Max Galactica! The World's Greatest Magician!
No, a magician.
Ahh... It's time to go.
Well, Nick... See you later. I'll come by to help clean the office. It's gotta be spotless for the New Year.
Maybe.
P-PEARL!! Look! It's time to go!
Nick!! It's t-t-terrible!!
Huh?
What are you talking about!?
Listen Nick! You have to turn on the TV!
That's the circus we went to!! Right!?
Yeah! They arrested him too!
Max! They arrested Max Galactica!!
Alright Nick! I'll see you in two hours at the Detention Center.
See you there. You've still got plenty of time to clean up your office later!
What are they talking about? Why did they arrest Max?
Maximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!
It's MAX!! Nick!! Look! It's the real Maximillion Galactica!!
H-H-He called me sweetie! *swoon* Nick!!
T-This one...
AHHHH!!! He got it! He got it! NICK! LOOK! HE GOT IT!!
Max... *swoon*
Max! You should let Nick pick a card!!
Y-Yes! I'm your biggest fan!!
Well Nick... I think it's time to get to work.
What's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?
Y-Y-Y-Yes...
Max, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about yourself...
Umm... There's a big piece of security glass between us...
Wow! That's incredible!
You are signed to an exclusive contract with the Berry Big Circus, correct?
You're right! You're so right!
Huh? What do you mean?
Y-Yes...
But I kinda like the circus performances...
The Ringmaster... You mean Russell Berry?
So then why were you arrested?
Nick... I don't think Max understands how serious this is.
What did you talk about with the Ringmaster, Max?
Salary?
Y-Yes...
What's the matter, Nick? You look all bent out of shape.
That's why you went to his room that night...?
He isn't wasting his time! Max... You're...
*whimper*
Re-Really? Is that really OK?
REALLY!?
Nick... You mind giving that to me when the case is over?
What's that?
Be-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!
Max...
Look at Max... He's crushed...
"Didn't kill nobody!?"
M-Max?
Umm... Max.
What's your real name?
... Ugh...
He's really just a country bumpkin!
H-Huh?
Alright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon Nick!
OK.
Maximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?
Huh? There's still lots of things we can do! Go to the scene of the crime, talk to witnesses, gather evidence...
We still don't even know what happened in the first place.
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Well, we never have enough information!
Well... Your badge is still shining. Barely.
You sure do love to show that off, don't you Nick? Who knows how many times you have shown it to me?
Once you start channeling spirits... They say you lose sight of who you actually are...
Not really. But... Just in case, I plan to write my autobiography.
...
Max... He's just some country bumpkin...
I guess. But his real name is... Billy Bob Johns.
Oh well! If a big star can do it, then you should pretend to be exotic too, Nick!
Max Galactica is a pretty big name! Anyways, what do you think about Naruhodo A. Wrighto?
The "A" stands for "Attorney".
If it's that pointless, then you don't have to worry about showing it to me.
We're here again...
Let's find someone who might know something about what happened.
The Berry Big Top is so... Very... B... *cough* Enormous...
I know! I know! It really gets your blood pumping doesn't it!?
Look! Look! It's Max!!
The stars on his cheek sure are dreamy... How about I draw a star on your cheek Nick? I've got a marker!
"Maximillion Galactica and his comical comrades!"
You're right. I haven't seen one in ages. I bet they stopped using them due to little kids climbing up to the top...
Candy and popcorn... They've even got snow cones!!
Nick... Do you think we can buy some snow cones?
YAY!! Wait a second... There's no syrup though! I want syrup!
Nick... The entrance is right here.
I know that! Nick... You can get your picture taken with Dali the elephant!
I know that too! Oh well... I'll just have to take a picture with whoever I stumble across...
They also sell programs. I forgot to buy one when we came to the circus last time.
Hmm... Sounds like a plan. Oh no... It looks like I forgot my wallet. ...
You know I'd never do that to you, Nick...
Hmm... This door must lead to the lodging house.
Do you really need to say "No Entry" if no one's actually entering? It's almost like a zen riddle, isn't it Nick?
I bet all of the stars stay at that lodging house.
Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!
Oh... Detective Gumshoe!
You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.
Nick! Nick! He complained!!
AHHHHH!!
GRRR!
What!? You didn't have an air conditioner? Did you ride your triceratops to work too?
They really pay you peanuts don't they?
How strange indeed... Hmm...
The murderer was sloppy leaving all these prints all over!
What!?
Detective Gumshoe... That's enough about Von Karma. What about that guy? What is he up to?
What happened to Edgeworth? You know! The Edgeworth that's Nick's rival! What in the world happened when I went back home!?
Nick won't tell me!
He's not around!?!? Nick! What does he mean Mr. Edgeworth isn't around!?
N-Nick?
... It was rather cold.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!
I'm not laughing!
Yeep!
Hah! There always seems to be something that doesn't quite fit!!
Footprints?
And... And... What is so mysterious about the footprints?
...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!
T-There's no way! Flying is impossible!
...? Why is that?
It must be because there's an eyewitness inside that Lodging House.
Well... I do have a Steel Samurai Badge with me. How about that one?
Then it's a deal! I hear that Detective Gumshoe has that very badge! ...
Actually, I've been thinking of taking a break from channeling.
I don't want to have another incident like last time.
But just because someone has a bad attitude doesn't make them a criminal.
Huh?
Well it does have very classy decorative elements.
Who cares if they are mundane!? At least they are easy to understand!!
Eh!?
Hmm... Are you sure you weren't born looking like that?
Well, there's not much you can do about that, so you just gotta keep on being tired!
Stingy!
The name tag on the door says "Moe" on it.
Wow... It's a real mess in here!
Oh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.
Look at the collection he's got! It's incredible!
Oh! I almost forgot!
I was thinking of starting a costume collection myself! I'll call it "World Spirit Channels"... We can display it in our office!
You're right. I wonder what happened?
What the!? There's a string of carrots here!
Nick, you can see the scene of the crime from here.
It's right in front of this window, about 30 feet away.
What? Those are pajamas? You mean he goes to bed dressed as a clown? Eww...
Wow. Moe is very studious.
Tee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!
Maybe he was just a little too excited during practice?
Awesome! Look at these shoes! They're great!
You sure it wasn't Moe's snack after lunch?
Wow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!
Why not!? You look like you'd be great at it!
Huh? Nick?
T-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!
Nick! You're too young to die! NICK!!
N-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?
...
Don't "What's the matter?" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!
W-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?
Eh?
C-Costume? You mean my clothes...?
Uhh... I guess not...
My name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.
The seats are kinda far away don't you think?
Five hundred... That's amazing.
Ah, a ladder.
What's the difference? They do the same thing, right? I think you should stick with the basic facts of the matter.
Look! That's where Max comes out during the show!!
I wanna try it too! I'll ride on Nick's back and jump out of the lion's mouth!
You know I've been meaning to ask you... What exactly do you mean when you say "clue"? What are you looking for?
Well there's definitely not one of those here...
Hey! It's a rope!
That's a bit strange... There weren't any tightrope walkers in the show when we saw it.
Whoa! Those lights are huge!
That's because everyone knows that you're cute!
Me!?
Really!? You think so!? Nick! Did you hear that!? Me!! A heroine!! What about Nick, Regina?
He's no hero, is he?
Hey Regina... What do you know about what happened last night?
That's right! The Ringmaster was your...
I'm so sorry about what happened to him...
Eh?
Why did you do that?
That's incredible that you are an animal tamer!
It has to be really scary!
Huh?
LÃ©on... He died?
Why did he do that?
Regina... What's the matter? What's on your mind?
What!? REALLY!?!?
Oh my! That's incredible Regina!!
C'mon Nick. There's no reason to pout!
Regina told me that someone professed their love to her!
Not only that! It was Maximillion Galactica!
And then, on the exact same day, another person professed their love for her as well!!
Someone named Trilo.
Apparently he is a tenor who sings in the circus.
Regina seems to be quite the hit with the men in the circus!
You're not kidding. Two people in one day! Even I want to profess my love for her!
Huh? Really?
Yep! I'm still training though.
Huh? As a spirit channeler?
Really!? She says I'd be a big hit!
It's OK! Nick and I will help him!
Hmm... Like what?
Hmm... Sort of...
You sure do!
His room?
Really? You too? I understand exactly what you mean...
Eww... Max is so pathetic like this...
Uh-huh... Very complex...
... Max isn't here.
Aww... I wanted to see a magic trick.
I guess so.
You don't say?
... That was cold...
This silk hat really does look like it can fly!!
You're right! Nick, I bet you could wear a hat like this! This is like one of those hats a famous detective would wear!
But... With a head as big as yours, you'd probably bust a hole in the* it!
Sometimes it seems like he's the only detective on the force. That would make Gumshoe really elite, wouldn't it?
You know, if she wasn't so mean, I think she and I would get along...
It is kinda cool though. I wouldn't mind having a whip myself. I bet that cracking the whip on you once or twice would be just what the doctor ordered!
Regina is sooo cute!
Can you believe that she's an animal tamer? That's sooo cool! I'd like to try animal taming someday. Nick! Nick! Lie down! Roll over!!
YAY!!! Remember, you promised, Nick!
Everyone loved the Ringmaster...
Motive will surely be a point of contention tomorrow in court.
This was the Ringmaster's room?
Now that you mention it, that is what he said.
Ah! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick! I want it!
Nick... Look at all the photos lined up on the wall...
This is so cool! It seems like there were so many happy memories. Maybe we should do this sort of thing at our office? Wa can put up pictures of all the clients who have been found not guilty.
Umm... We'll just pretend like they don't exist. How's that? ... Nick! Now you've got me thinking about losing cases! Why'd you do that!?
All of these frames look the same.
... You're kidding right?
Nick! Look at all the cute trophies!!
Like... "All County Quiz Champions"... "Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master"... "Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ"... "Pet Grooming Grand Prix"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...
There's a lot of posters here don't you think?
So many posters that they aren't likely to miss one, are they?
But... But... You didn't even notice that I took one!
Heh! Heh!
Posters are the way to go aren't they?
We should make posters to promote our law firm. "Spine tingling legal action! Mind numbing legalese! You will say 'wow'!" Or perhaps, "Hold it! Don't miss out on a stunning life or death courtroom thrill ride!"
You may not know this, but they call this a "tailcoat".
What?
Huh? Where? Where?
Ahhh... You always make me feel like I'm doing something wrong...
This is where the Ringmaster applied his makeup.
This one says it is "100% All Natural Organic Mascara."
The Ringmaster must have been really concerned about skin care... Very metrosexual.
This is strange... Everything else looks nice, but this desk looks old and cheap.
He really loved her didn't he? Regina was lucky to have such a wonderful father.
Ah! Look at this! Max's salary is written on this piece of paper. YIKES!
I didn't know a magician... This salary is incredible!
Incredible, huh?
What's the matter, Nick?
Eww... There's mud caked on the table.
Nick! Don't even think about it!
Huh? Hey Nick! Look over there!
There's someone over there! Ex-Excuse me!
Wow! He sure is a quiet one! Excuse me!!
An average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.
I'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.
Ventriloquist?
You're* last name is Woodman? *snicker*
Ah... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?
Nick. Cheer up! Just try and smile!
Would you mind telling us something about Max? Maximillion Galactica.
Ben, so you're a ventriloquist?
Nick! Don't yell at him! You can't do that!!
Ben, do you mind showing me some of your skills as a ventriloquist?
Would you mind taking a look at this?
... I guess we won't need you to look at this after all.
Huh? You don't know him?
Hmm...
Which poster is cooler? This one or the Steel Samurai poster?
I guess putting a poster of a magician in a law office is kinda strange.
Looking at this really makes you think.
No matter how great a medium I become, there is no way I could make this kind of money.
You only live once, right? Well, then you might as well live it fabulously!
Being a ventriloquist sounds like an interesting job.
Maybe I should give it a try then! Here I go! "Hello e-e-everyone... I-I-I'm Phoenix Wright." "No matter what the lie or who the liar, I'll expose them for what they are!" What's the verdict?
Y-Yeah... Maybe I should sign up for some expert training.
Hello...?
Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
C'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!
No! Nick! You can't!!
OK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...
Umm... Did you just use the word "snazzy" in a sentence?
Hehe...
There's a hole in the ceiling... Why is there a hole in the ceiling?
"Overdid it a little"...?
Huh?
Yep! I saw you use them! You must believe in a carrot and no stick approach. You put the carrot out in front for motivation, but I guess the trick is gauging what flavor you want each day...
Umm... They all seem to cover rather basic topics though...
What's this? A banana peel? *slips*
Ow ow ow ow ow...
Wow. He really is a pro, huh Nick!? His falls are totally different than my slip!
Could you please tell us more about the Berry Big Circus?
Twenty years!? Wow!
But... But... I LOVE THE CIRCUS!
Nick! He just made a joke! Laugh!!
I see...
I'm sorry Moe. Nick was born without a sense of humor.
"Caught a peek...?"
New elements...?
Make-believer?
That's not fair!
Nick! You can do it!!
...
At least his expectations are low.
I'm sorry he's incapable of being funny, Moe.
Moe's taking this really hard...
It really is a shame what happened to the Ringmaster, huh Moe?
Moe!!
Why do you hate him so much?
The cafeteria?
Larina?
Trilo...?
Really?
What's the matter?
Ahhhh... I see... It must be because you have one of those "Roman Noses"... Roamin' all over your face.
... I didn't cross the line there did I?
Nick! He was giving you good advice! Don't be so close-minded!!
Ah! Thank you!! Umm... This is an atlas!!
Moe is a really nice guy, don't you think Nick? He taught us all about the inner workings of the circus.
And he's got such a great sense of humor. It tickles your funny bone, doesn't it?
He was good friends with the Ringmaster?
Hmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick?
Eww... This place is gross.
That reminds me... What was it that Moe said?
He also said that, "There's Gotti be something interesting there." Nick? What's "Gotti be interesting?"
Hmph!
I wouldn't mind trying my hand at cooking for this many people. Maya's Killer Hamburger... You'd try it, wouldn't you?
"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!"
Maybe they should make it easier to understand... "Clean it or die!"
Boring... Maybe we should leave a juicy tidbit for someone to read!
You know... Like a fake clue! Hmm... Maybe something like... "Message from the Killer!"
Look here... Max is written on it. It must be his VIP table.
Well, he could still eat hamburgers, right?
You know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!
One, because I hate dirty cafeterias. Two, because one bears repeating.
Arrrggghh... You know I really hate dirty cafeterias!!
They didn't seem too worried about cleaning up the dishes, did they? Hmm... Looking at all these dishes is making me hungry! Let's go get a burger at the snack stand outside.
... Alright! Then let's get this over with Nick!! Here we go!! Whoahh!
That's what it looks like.
Or maybe Regent just likes to eat his dinner in the cafeteria?
Ahhh... Watch out Nick! Broken glass on the floor is dangerous!
Do you think it means anything?
Huh?
Him?
We heard a lot about you at the circus, Max.
Max, you aren't very popular with the other performers, are you?
Wow! That's so cool!
Hmm...
They found the Ringmaster's body in the plaza in front of the lodging house.
...Huh?
Really? You had quite a few to begin with then, huh?
That's awful... Especially for a magician.
How could he possibly have such a large amount of debt?
Wow... Now I can see how you can get that much debt.
Sounds like you are describing Regina!
... That's the first time I've ever heard you say something nice about someone, Max.
There isn't much you can do about that, right?
Umm...
Awww... Don't you think that's sweet of him, Nick?
...I guess you two haven't worked out your differences yet.
Why did you fight with him? Ben seems like such a quiet man.
You mean Regina?
"Ill-bred"!! Are you talking about the same Ben!?
What!?
Um... What do you mean by "shut him up"?
Trilo...?
You hid him? You mean the ventriloquist's puppet?
Umm... Where did you hide him?
Well... Ben does seem awfully lonely without his puppet.
No problem! None at all! Thank you Max!!
Huh? Ben's not here anymore!
It's cold out... He's probably in the tent.
What do you think, Nick? I wonder if we've been making any progress...
But... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.
And now Regina isn't here!
The seats are so far away from the ring...
Hey Nick... Do you think that if every person in the audience screamed all at once, the vibration they'd create could cause the big top to collapse?
Hey! Look! That's where Max makes his grand appearance!
... I want to try entering court like that.
Whoa! Those lights are huge! If they fell from the ceiling, you'd be going to the circus in the sky... Life is so fragile, isn't it Nick?
It's so fragile that I've decided to eat as much good food as I can before I die. Like hamburgers...
Awww... It's closed!?
It looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing.
I'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!
Yeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us. He said that he hid Trilo somewhere in this room.
Nick! Look at all the cute trophies!!
Like... "All County Quiz Champions"... "Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master"... "Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ"... "Pet Grooming Grand Prix"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...
That's Trilo! That's Ben's puppet!
Why do I have to carry this thing!?
...What? You're up against what for Regina's love!?
Oh! Hey Ben!
Hello to you too! It's awfully cold today don't you agree?
Don't you think it's cold Nick?
Do you know anything at all?
Well...
I gotta admit, I'm kinda interested in this place as well. Moe is so funny, and Max is so amazing... Not to mention Regina being the cutest little thing I have ever seen!
Hmm... Are you sure about that?
Ahh... Ben... This is yours isn't it?
Here ya go!
It's that time isn't it? See ya around, Ben!
So Nick... Where are we going next?
Who said that?
Ben? Is that you Ben?
Nick! What just happened? Trilo is still a puppet right? A ventriloquist's puppet!
I guess so...
These two are really an odd couple, aren't they Nick?
Your partner... You mean Ben?
Oh... My...
Your...
Ma-Ma-Ma-Marry!?
You... You're going to marry... Regina?
You gave her a song?
Well... Umm... The melody is pretty good.
AHHH!
Tri... Trilo?
Nick... What's going on?
Ahhhhh...
Hmm... What in the world happened with Ben and Trilo?
What is it, Nick?
WHHHAAATTT!?
Regina!!
His name is Monke... Money?
Haha... That's pretty funny.
Huh? You don't know?
What!?
Oh, I see!
Do you mind telling us a bit about Ben?
What do you mean "hanging around"?
But... What about Ben?
Regina, you were proposed to, weren't you?
Huh? Really? That's strange, isn't it Nick?
Ahh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it.
So I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet.
Huh? What?
NICK! YOU CAN'T SHOW HER THAT PICTURE!!
Do you know how Max flies in the sky like he does?
You know!?
Wow! That's incredible!!
Oh, don't pout Nick!
Sorry we tricked you Nick.
Huh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.
Nick! Look out! They've got the killer trapped behind that tarp!
What? It wasn't funny? You know it wouldn't have hurt you to look even a little bit surprised.
What!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!?
Wow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney.
This safety light was on at the time of the murder, wasn't it?
See Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!
We're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?
She's such a cutie, too.
Sounds like Pearly...
She lives in a dream world...
Oh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right?
Then who does he belong to?
You mean right now?
Woohoo!!
Eh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...
Thanks Moe! See you later!
Huh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...
Oh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.
There is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think?
I guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off.
Go ahead Nick. I know you want to ride on it too!
Hey... The net's ripped. Money must be prone to breaking things... He's hardcore.
I think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know.
Of course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk.
Hehe... It's a monkey calendar!
Maybe a little too much... Wow... I just realized that the year is almost over. Amazing how time flies.
Well, we still got one last person to help this year... Max.
Nick, there's nothing unusual about that at all. It's how things are supposed to be!
Hey, Nick!
I don't have this one! This barbell here is a new model!
Holy cow! There's a fork... And a mirror... Everything's shiny!! There's even a really cheap looking knockoff wristwatch!
Nick! I found it! Your badge! It's right here!!
What's the matter? Did you find something?
It's a ring...
Do you think we'll win in court tomorrow?
Don't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!
Max?
What?
St-Stage? Don't worry... There won't be a stage. All you have to do is sit down.
Nick. Max is really nervous.
Don't worry Max... Just do what Nick says and everything will be OK.
Max... Really... No one needs to fly today. ... Nick? What's with that look in your eyes?
I guess being born with the name Von Karma is a free pass to be arrogant and annoying.
Her dad is gone you know...
Eh? What's the matter? Nick?
I wonder if that has some sort of special meaning?
There wasn't much that we could go after Gumshoe with this time...
I didn't see anything... But that's why you're the lawyer and I'm the medium.
You mean all we're gonna get out of him is that little bottle of pepper?
I wonder if Trilo will show up on the stand as well...?
It had a good rhythm...
Celebrities must really enjoy saying everything that flashes into their minds.
Nick, I think you should put a little bit more effort into preparing your questions...
Maybe you should take a step back and look things over again, Nick.
Think about it some more Nick! I'm sure you'll come up with something!!
Think about it some more Nick! I'm sure you'll come up with something!!
Hmm... Trilo wouldn't happen to have an ulterior motive for incriminating Max, would he?
Umm Nick... Wasn't Ben the one who got knocked over the head?
Aww... Did you hear that? His sigh seemed a little wistful.
Nick! Don't be such a coward!
What's the matter, Nick?
Hmm, I wonder how much he receives for appearing in the circus?
How about it Nick?
That's the spirit Nick! Give him heck!
Maybe you should leave the courtroom drama for video games and rethink that one...
Where there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it.
Yeah!
I think so too... I guess you really are "Wright all the time!"
Bluffing is everything in this world! ...But I'm sure you already learned that one!!
CLOAK!
But... It's fun shouting out with everyone else!!
There has to be a hole in his testimony somewhere.
All we can do is try, right Nick!? We've gotta have something that will prove useful.
Nick, I just thought of something... If Ben and Trilo really didn't see anyone that night, they wouldn't have testified that they greeted someone that night, would they?
I think that Trilo really did say "good evening" to someone that night.
Nick, you've got to think about things a bit more and give it another shot!
So then where were you when the murder took place?
That's when the Ringmaster headed to the scene of the crime... Right?
But... The Ringmaster must've been wearing Max's costume. Right?
Which means?
Heh Heh... Well done Nick.
Wow Max. I never thought of that. You should be a detective or something!
That's really cool...
Aww... Poor Moe can't be his normal stoogey self in court.
Nick! You've gotta find some kind of contradiction in his testimony!
C'mon Nick, just listen to his joke!
You are sooo boring.
Maybe we should get a bit more information... Once we find something more solid, we can give it another shot!
You know... Moe's testimony and what he told us yesterday are kinda different...
You can do it, Nick!
Great job, Nick!
Was Max really at the crime scene that night...?
They claim it was a blunt object... At least it says so in the autopsy report.
N-Nick... You've gotta find a contradiction in this.
What?
Yay! Everyone get ready!! All... Together... Now...
Nick! This is your last chance!
Whaddya think, Nick?
He's turned into a bratty little kid.
What's the matter, Nick?
It doesn't look like it worked.
I dunno why, but I get the feeling things are gonna get worse before they get better.
Wow, he looks really serious right now. More serious than he's looked all day!
Nick, wait! That means that Max actually used magic!!
They say the criminal flew off into the air and disappeared!
But it looks so effortless for you on stage...
Wow... You just told me the secret to your magic!!
Nick! What do we do now!?
Great idea! Let's do our best and catch this sucker!
Umm... Nick?
I've got a confession to make... I'm terrible at figuring out magic tricks...
Yep. Magic tricks are by their very definition tricks, right? But I can never figure out the tricks when I see them. I'm just not good at it...
But but... The trick Pearly showed me was incredible!
Let's see. It looked like she pulled the end of her own thumb off!
First she put her right thumb next to her left hand, and then it just separated! She could move it up and down and everything! It was incredible!
WHAT!? WOW! HOW'D YOU DO THAT!? Nick, you're like a real magician! See this is why I just can't figure out magic... I'm no good at it... Especially hard tricks like flying away from the scene of a murder...
Hey! I'm reading that one! You know I'm studying the law now, right!? I put that bookmark on the page I was reading... Don't you dare move it!
Well, you have to start somewhere right?
... Maybe you really should sell all these books, Nick.
Nick, you've been watering the plant everyday, right? I've been thinking about watering it too.
But he'd get bigger!
Umm... It's covered with dust. Maybe you should use your desk every now and again.
You know about the new "Steel Samurai" movie they are making, don't you Nick?
It's already out! Critics say, "Time to commit 'hara-kiri' if you miss this action epic!"
You know, I bet the star will win this year's Hero of Heroes Grand Prix!!
...
Yay! Let's hurry and wrap this case up so we can see it!
Lately they've been holding huge events at the Gatewater. It seems they've really become a top-class hotel. I wonder if that bellboy would remember us?
There's no way we can solve the mystery of a criminal flying by tomorrow... I was thinking... Do you really think the criminal flew through the air? The only one who thinks that is Moe, right? He says that he saw it.
Do you think he might be trying to frame Max?
But... What if the criminal really did fly? There's only one person who could do that... Max.
Everyone seems to hate Max. Ben, Trilo, Moe... They all have nothing nice to say.
He even hit Ben over the head with a bottle. But...
But that doesn't seem enough to frame another person for murder!!
Maybe Ben saw the Ringmaster wearing Max's costume, but Moe clearly said that he saw Max himself.
Oh yeah... The picture of the scene. I wonder what that wooden box is?
I can't believe there was only a bottle of pepper in that thing. It must be related to the crime somehow... This is fun, isn't it Nick?
Awww... You're right. I should take things more seriously.
No matter how you look at it, this is definitely Max's silk hat.
There's something wrong with this hat though.
Hmm... This really is a mystery.
Whoa. Max used a broken bottle to crack Ben over the head?
He must have really hit him hard then... I guess I should give it a try... For research purposes. Come here... I've got a nice bottle right here for you Nick...
That's weird. It didn't break.
Can you believe this cost three months of pay? Three months!! Trilo doesn't skimp when it comes to Regina. He's really in love.
I bet Money would love to get his hands on this again.
Twenty pounds, huh? That's pretty heavy.
The more you think about it the more it starts to make your head hurt. But compared to tomorrow this will all be a happy memory.
You wanna know something Nick? I love to put pepper on my hamburgers. But I also like to put pepper on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Do you think I'm weird?
You don't seem to be in a very good mood today.
Yeah. I guess that would put you in a bad mood.
If Moe says that he saw a flying criminal, that means it must have been...
But Max... He is a magician.
What if they set something up so they could trick Moe?
Umm... Yeah... Sorry. I got nothing.
Really? What kind of TV special?
Hey! That sounds like it would be an awesome special!
Max! Max! Do you mind teaching me the trick behind flying?
I was thinking about this in court today... I've got a favor to ask of you.
Be friends with the other performers in the circus!
But...!
Something about what Max just said rings true to my ears...
Wow.
That's incredible Max... I want a trophy too! Hey Nick! How about you buy me a trophy!?
Max! How could you!? How could you hit poor Ben over the head with this!?
You mean Trilo said that? Not Ben, right?
Hmm... I guess you're right.
That's really cool! I wouldn't mind seeing your trophy some day.
The cafeteria? You mean the one inside the circus tent?
It's in the cafeteria? We were just there yesterday. Nick, did you see a bust anywhere inside the cafeteria?
You hear that? It sounds like two people arguing...
Hello Ben. Hello to you too, Trilo.
I'm sorry...
In a round!? You can really do that!? That's incredible!
Oh, I almost forgot! I wanted to give this back to you.
The murder took place right over there..
I know... The Ringmaster seems like he was such a good man. It * so sad... For everyone.
Umm... I know that you already testified in court today...
Yes.
What would you have thought if he wasn't wearing those symbols?
I was hoping I could ask you about Regina...
Really? That's so sweet... But if you really wanted to see Regina, shouldn't you check out the tent?
Eh?
How so?
Umm... Y-Yeah... I-I knew that...
So how is this new routine working out?
That sounds incredible!
Trilo, you seem to really be fired up about all this!!
You're right! You're right!
You're the man now, doll!
Would you mind taking a look at this?
... I guess we won't need you to look at this after all.
Huh? Where's Regina?
Hehe... Nick. You're kinda a chicken, aren't you?
Max and the Ringmaster had their talk in this room.
Why'd he do that? Maybe it was cold or something?
They still haven't cleaned this place up yet. If Pearly got one look at the state of this place... She'd slap whoever was in charge across the face!!
Franziska really set you up bad this time, didn't she? If you ask me, she should be listening to Moe herself...
Why are you defending her?
Huh? How's that possible?
Oh, I see... Who lives in that room behind the window up there?
*shivers* V-Von Karma...
If he was here, you would have been able to tell even before you stepped into his room. I'm sure you would've heard him laughing away... "Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!"
I always thought he was just thinking up new jokes.
They're not actually pajamas. They're actually costumes. Uh huh... I guess you could say that they're professional sleepwear.
You've really gotta give it to Moe... Slipping on a banana 100 times a day. That's incredible. Maybe I should try giving it a shot myself. I guess I'll start out by juggling.
This is where Moe witnessed the crime.
These carrots like like they are the pick of the crop, don't they?
Hmm... What do you think about this theory? A long time ago, the circus was down on its luck. Moe was so hungry that he had to steal the horses food to survive. But he got addicted to their orangey goodness... Ha ha ha ha ha.
Tee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!
Well, you've got to give them all a shot. Trying is the most important thing!!
Umm... Ahh! I got it!!
Because they are in the CafÃ© Teary Eye!
I did it!!
That's a great one Moe. I would have never thought of that.
"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!"
Huh? It says... "Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!?"
You know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!
Uhhh...
Really? What were you going to cook?
That's what it looks like.
So what happened? What was her answer?
Today's been a really crazy day, hasn't it?
Tough?
Hmm...
You even used the famed "No shoes, no shirt, no service" joke!
Flew through the air?
It disappeared?
Hmm... Hey! This thing is really cool! Nick! Nick! I want someone to make a bust of me!
Aww...
I guess there really aren't any other things that have changed, huh?
Yikes! It says, "To The Murderer!!"
Before the murder!?
Nick! I think this is a very important clue!
I know...
Huh?
What is is then?
Huh? You've seen it as well?
Hehe.
What do you mean?
I see...
Do you know anything about this note?
Your heart skipped a beat?
Really!? Out of curiosity, what in the world was written on that thing?
Uh-huh...
Hey, do you see that? There's a scrap of paper shoved into the pocket of the tailcoat.
I bet that's the other half of the note that Moe gave us. Then let's hurry up and check this thing out, Nick! I knew it! It fits perfectly with the other piece.
Tonight at 10:00 PM?
Now we need to find out who called out the Ringmaster!!
It's been expertly cleaned and pressed. It's got one perfect crease.
This is kinda pointless isn't it? There's no way this beats Moe's room. Now that's cool!
Wha...? Moe's gone.
Mmmm... Hammburrgeerrrr... Just thinking about it is making me hungry! All of a sudden I need a burger bad!!
Hey Detective Gumshoe! I'm sure you did a good job as usual.
Nick, what is that? That beeping sound?
Huh?
I didn't know that Gumshoe could run that fast! So much for being a flatfoot.
Well, let's go inside... It's freezing out here! Uh oh... The whi... OWWWW!! That whip could cut right through me...!!
Why do you keep giving Nick the evil eye!? It doesn't matter if you prove the defendant guilty tomorrow... Nothing will be able to bring your dad back!
Of course! Your dad! I know you miss him...
What!? Edgeworth!? Mr... EDGEWORTH!?
!! Manfred... von... Karma...
That means that Edgeworth was...
Huh? Little brother? Edgeworth and Nick are the same age...
HUH!?
Nick! What does she mean!?
Mr. Edgeworth... He's dead?
What about this? OWWW!! She hit me again.
N-N-Nick! Umm... About Edgeworth?
N-Nick...?
Wha... What happened?
Nick?
I'm sorry I brought it up, Nick...
Mr... Acro.
Acro, you're a member of this circus as well?
Eww... It's a huge pile of trash!
I guess you're right. Look! They're all shiny things.
Of course it's a tuba, silly! You didn't know that!?
Well, she is a shining beauty.
Hehe... It's a monkey calendar!
...!!
It seems like the Ringmaster was truly a saint.
Regina is so cute!! She's truly a princess.
Umm...
Umm... I'm sorry to ask, but why are you in a wheel chair?
That's awful...
Out of curiosity, what kind of accident was it again?
Huh?
I see... The scene of the crime was right below your window.
What did you see?
Whaaatttt!?
N-Nick...
Acro...
It looks like something is really weighing on him.
Aww... That's so cute!
It was posted in the cafeteria the morning before the murder.
Her?
A diamond shining in his soul?
Acro...
Hmm... Nick and Von Karma, huh...
She's cool, isn't she? And can you believe such a cute girl is an animal tamer!?
Huh?
W-Whaddya mean by that?
I'd say it seems that way.
What?
Is that why you started with acrobatics?
That's such a nice story.
Aww Nick! You can't let him get to you like that! You're an attorney!
I'm sorry...
What do you think of this!?
Oh... We're sorry...
That's not really important is it?
YAAAH!! NICK!!
A monkey?
It's a pity about what happened to the Ringmaster.
Everyone loved him, didn't they? He must have been quite a man.
For a while?
A s-star?
What do you mean "there's no way I believe that"!?
Of course!
Just to go back up and clear something up... Why'd you want to teach Money a lesson?
Something that means a lot to you? It must be something shiny right?
What are spangles?
Leave it all up to us!
Nick, I wanna try flying too!
But don't you think using a tiger to scare him is a bit much?
Do you really have to ask that!? It's dangerous to use a tiger for that kinda thing!!
R-Really!?
That's when you realized the piece of paper was in your pocket?
You didn't put it on the bulletin board in the cafeteria, did you?
Well... Umm... I don't think I'd go so far as to say he was OK...
I'm sure he's going to come back here... Right, Nick?
That's the spirit. Even though he won't be coming home...
I-I'm s-s-sorry.
Hmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick?
The trapeze is that enormous swing hanging from the top of the tent, right?
Something smells fantastic! So we know it can't be Moe... Wait! I know what it is!! It's burgers!!
Mmm... It smells so good in here... Those burgers look great!
I bet! I can tell by the smell.
Now that the Ringmaster is gone, what are you going to do?
What!? Really!?
Max?
Moe...
He must mean the tragic death of the Ringmaster, right?
Mmm... That looks so tasty!
Acro was so happy to have joined the circus...
... They must have taken Max in for questioning again.
You're right, I guess... Alright, let's go then.
Hmm... Moe's not here.
S-Stop it, Nick... You're scaring me!
Nick!! It's Money!!
That's it! That's the thing "that means a lot" to Regina, remember?
Yikes!!
You know... Man-to-man isn't really accurate. It was more like man-to-monkey.
Umm... It sounded like he was confused at the end of that "Ooooh".
Yikes!!
Yikes!!
Nick! What's that?
Really? You're really on the ball today, Nick! Lemme see it... Lemme see it!!
You know what I mean... I really want to try on Regina's costume...
Hmm...
It doesn't fit me at all!
Why!?
Uh huh. Uh huh.
Uh huh. Uh huh... Wait... You put your HEAD into a lion's MOUTH!?
R-R-Regina!! Everything was alright though right?
Here you go Regina!!
Hey Regina. That costume is yours right? I tried it on, but it didn't fit me...
You know... The lion she told us about.
You named Money the Monkey? And Regent, Regina's tiger?
Really?
Nick's name is simple and easy to associate, right Wright?
Lyin'...
Did someone... die?
Coma...?
I see...
B-Brother?
Umm... Who is Acro's younger brother?
Why'd he do that?
He? You mean LÃ©on?
No way!! That's impossible!!
Nick? Can lions smile?
So that's what really happened...
Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... *Achoo!* *Achoo!*
Huh? You think so?
Nick! I think I'd make a good clown!
Heh heh! Does Regina sneeze with pepper too?
B-Bat?
They looked perfect together, huh?
Well, he did say, "I'll be back." Wait... or was that someone else?
A dare?
That's insane!! Didn't he know how dangerous that is!?
Poor Bat...
What about Bat?
I see...
Gross... It's covered in blood.
What!?
Nick!
What do you think it all means?
But the scarf is evidence in the trial!
Acro... A witness!?
Now what do we do, Nick? How are we going to handle tomorrow?
Look at you all full of confidence!! You must have found something you can use!
Good morning, Max.
R-Regina!!
Huh?
Regina's different, don't you think, Nick?
Huh!? You think he did it...?
What are you going to do then, Nick!?
You're right... But it's gonna be tough...
You want us to make sure Regina watches?
Acro must be lying about things, huh?
Well, put the pedal to the metal, Nick!
Are you OK, Nick?
What are you doing, Nick!?
Way to keep them on their toes, Nick!
Can you do it Nick? Can you really do that!?
Alright! Then let's do it!!
That's true! Moe said that he saw Max, didn't he?
Be careful, Nick. If you mess up here...
Nick! You've gotta show them some evidence!
I think you should try again, especially before someone gets the chance to say something.
Acro's at a loss for words!
I wouldn't lose either, slow poke! ...I mean Nick!
Hey, Nick?
What if you turned things around? Maybe if you think of it sorta like this... "If he knew the location of the Ringmaster's head, then he could drop the bust."
The main problem is how he could have aimed for the Ringmaster's head.
That's the ticket, Nick! Show them what you've got!
Hmm... I don't remember us finding any sort of tool... But maybe we overlooked something...
No Nick! You didn't think enough!!
N-N-Nick!! Don't tell me you're losing your memory already!
Hey, stick out your head a little! I've got just the thing... A MAYA KICK!!
Ah! That means...
MAYA KICK!!
Well... Hmm... Or maybe this bust was the murder weapon... But it was used by accident.
Nick! Don't let her beat you now!
You're getting barraged with questions, Nick...
It's because you're on the wrong track!
Nick! Do you really have a handle on all of this?
Acro's been playing mind games with all of us!
Nick... They say they want evidence...
"Unusual"?
OK then! Use that and get out of this jam!
Can you do it, Nick!?
Let's do this, Nick! Then maybe Von Karma will finally throw in the towel...
Well... So much for that theory.
W-What do we do!? There's no doubting that Acro deeply respected the Ringmaster!
Acro tried to pin the murder on you on purpose...
Well... that's one way to put it.
Ahh... Detective Gumshoe...
We've got some really tasty milk!
Now about that evidence you mentioned... What is it!?
Huh? This was... Yesterday in Acro's room...
Won't Von Karma be mad that you're doing this?
Von Karma looked like she was in a pretty big hurry though.
What did he mean by that... "The very last instant" part.
Ahhh! Don't scare me like that!
Finally we get to the motive! Wait... Nick, are you OK?
... *gulp*
Nick, the judge is getting misty eyed.
Nick! Isn't Acro such a wonderful person!?
Nick, I hate to say it, but I agree with them.
What do you think, Nick?
Y-You mean...
Yeah... Von Karma set you up again...
Ouch... Biggest Failure in Court... That stings!
Nick...?
Those two are finishing each other's sentences now...
Hey, Nick... Isn't Regina listening to all of this from the audience?
I hope Regina can handle it...
Nick! I thought you were going somewhere with this!
Really, Nick?
What's wrong with you!! You can't just pick random people!
Now what do we do? No one seems to be going along with your theory. Do you think what happened to Bat was actually an accident!?
What's the matter, Nick!?
Nick... You sure you want to go with that?
How exactly does this evidence prove the reason LÃ©on bit Bat? You don't think that there's something better you should present instead!?
A-Acro...
Nick! You've gotta do something...!
W-Why aren't you going to search his room!?
Do something Nick! Don't let this case slip away!! The bust... Where is it now?
You're Phoenix Wright! You know where that bust is! I'm sure you do!
Where is Max's bust...? The defense needs time to prepare to present it's* lace... I mean case. Sorry, I'm a bit nervous and I just bit my tongue.
The rest is up to you, Nick! Good luck!
Acrobat's* always have their lives on the lines, don't they? That's how Acro's lived his life up until now. Now it's time for us to walk across our own tightrope! If we don't, we're certain to lose!
Nick! What about where Ben and Trilo were standing!?
Nick! You've gotta think things over again...
That reminds me! Our office is just as messy as that cafeteria!
N-Nick! Get up, Nick!
Nick... Are you OK?
I can't believe that Von Karma thought that far ahead... It's amazing!
Acro...
Acro, the Ringmaster, Regina, and Bat... Not a single one of them was a bad person inside, huh?
...
We were just thinking about Acro...
Huh?
Regina...
Poor Regina...
That's right, Regina... He's still alive you know.
Uh huh...
What...?
Poor Regina...
Yay! I can't wait!!
Nick!
I can't wait to go see the best circus the world has ever seen!

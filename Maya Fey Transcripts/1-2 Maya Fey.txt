Maya... Maya Fey.
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
W-why would Sis write my name?
I'm sorry, I've never seen that before.
Eek!
...! Um... that... That's my name...
K-killer...? I'm not--
W-what?
Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?
Up... to me?
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
R-really...?
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
... ... ...
...Heh...
What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?
I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!
... I knew it. No one will believe me.
Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.
I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...
Wow! Really? How'd that go?
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!
That's what she said!
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...
... I know...
Yes?
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first- class, too!
What?
Yes. ...In training.
...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...
Poor Sis... *sniff*
I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.
Y-you mean the one with my name on it?
Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?
Why? Don't you think I did it, too?
That detective thinks I did it.
I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.
That detective took it when they brought me in.
Sorry... I've never seen that before.
... Um...!
Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?
This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?
Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...
... ... ...
Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.
Tomorrow.
...You're right. ...
Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!
I have no one left to ask!
... ... ...
Y-you will? Thank you so much!
They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.
They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.
Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?
I see...
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood. About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
The case was solved... we thought.
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
... White...
That was his name. My sister told me.
Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?
Thank you.
Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer?
... What really happened?
You don't mean... He refused to help?
... I see. I've been abandoned, then.
Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...
Good-bye.
! Why?
H-how do you know?
You don't know?
... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...
R-right! Thank you!
Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?
White... That was his name. My sister told me.
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
[Again? What's it this time?]
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
[Again? What's it this time?]
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
[Again? What's it this time?]
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!
I think I might be your newest fan!
Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?
Oh... I see.
A "lead"?
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?
Yes sir!
Do you think he was the one who...?
Sis...
I'm counting on you!
... Wright! Mr. Wright!
Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you!
What? You mean, you...?
I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do?
Alright!
Leave it to me! I am Mia's sister, after all! Lawyership runs in our blood!
I'd better run to the bookstore and pick up a copy of "Law for Rookies."
Cheer for you? You mean... like a cheerleader?
Alright! Leave it to me!
I'd better go get a uniform and some pom-poms...!
You mean... a jail break?
Alright!
Oh, I'd better go get a hacksaw while the stores are still open. Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, and a getaway car! Can you drive?
What what what?
No way!
But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind!
O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two!
Well... I guess this is it!
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?
Ph-Phoenix...?
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...
Whaaaat!?
Let him have it, Phoenix!
Psst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?
Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.
What do you think Phoenix?
Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as odd?
Ph-Phoenix! Wait!
He saw the stand through the office window before it fell over... That's what he's saying, right?
How could that be possible?
There's no way he could have seen it! And you have proof!
Phoenix... I don't think that's what you meant.
Phoenix! He's getting a lot less talkative.
Good luck, Phoenix...
What are you talking about? It's me! Maya!
What, did I look like my sister?
Hmm! I might be able to use that. "Oh, Phoenix! Go to the store and buy me lunch, would you?"
Because of this! See? Mia wrote me a letter. "Take care of Phoenix for me."
She means the office! This office! Someone has to help with the new Wright & Co. Law Offices, right? And who better but me! Maya Fey, reporting for duty! Wait, no, on second thought, let's make this casual! Yo, Nick! Maya here, ready to get down to business! You... don't mind me calling you "Nick," do you? It's a great name! Mia said that's what your friend Larry calls you.
You know what this means? We're partners!
Right! Okay, Nick, let's do it!
Burgers, dummy! Burgers! There's a great burger joint just down the street. C'mon! Time's a wasting!

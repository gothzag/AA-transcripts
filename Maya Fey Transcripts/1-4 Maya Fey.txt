Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?
Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!
Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!
Oh. Darn.
... Good idea!
Nick?
The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.
... Good idea, Nick!
Nick?
The fireman yelled at me when I called him.
What? You mean, the prosecutor?
Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?
Let's go find out, Nick!
What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!
Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.
I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!
You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?
I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!
Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.
Nick... Should we be laughing?
Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!
Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?
M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Huh?
"Gourdy"? What's that!?
Wh-what do you mean by that?
Wh-what!?
Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
!!! Why not?
Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.
But, Nick...
This is where it happened?
I can see some police walking around in there.
Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?
Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!
Eek!
He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...
I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.
But... no waterfall.
And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
How did he get there so fast?
You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?
R-right! Who cares what the witness says!
... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?
Oh no!
Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.
Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?
What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?
W-why not?
I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?
Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?
You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.
Right! Now, let's get investigating!
... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.
N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?
Okay, we'll come back.
... Do I look like a criminal or something?
Wowsers! This is "Gourd Lake"?
Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!
I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!
They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now. I mean, like, y'know!?
Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.
Say, Nick. Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?
Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?
Oh. Okay.
Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...
Hey, Nick! It might be a clue! Let's take it.
Was it that obvious?
Aww, listen to your inner child a little, Nick!
I already put it in my pocket.
Nick! If we don't hurry Mr. Edgeworth will get the death sentence!!!
Nick... what is this place?
Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.
Hey, good idea! You bet!
Nick?
I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.
I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!
Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!
Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!
Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "YO! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!
I think it's broken, Nick.
Wait, what if the sign said "No Setting Tents on Fire"?
Oh...
Hey, Nick!
No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?
So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!
Wow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "HEY! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!
Maybe it's broken?
Well what then? I know!
... Yep. It responded.
Eek!
Ah? Wha... huh? S-sorry!
I-I'll pay you back!
Uh... well...
N-Nick, help!
I'm really sorry!
Sorry...
S-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The culture gap and all...
Th-thanks. I think I'll be okay.
So, what is it you do, Lotta?
Wow! Neat! Nick! She's a research student at a university! Country U.!
So, when did you come up here?
That's quite a camera you have there.
Umm... So, what's that device you have stuck to the camera?
It started moving all by itself when I fired my party popper...
A programmable camera! Neat!
Hah hah!
Hah... hah... oh. Ahem.
She went inside her SUV. I guess we should come back later...
Who was that with the camrea...? Lotta something? Let's go talk to her about that photograph!
... I guess Detective Gumshoe is still in that meeting.
Detective Gumshoe!
Has Mr. Edgeworth said anything?
So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?
I see...
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.
Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
A "working relationship"?
I see...
...Nick?
Can you show me that photo of the victim? ... That face...!
I... I don't know. I just have this feeling that I met him somewhere a long time ago. ...
...
...
...
Oh. Nothing... just, something's been bothering me. ... Could you show me that autopsy report once more? ... ... ... Hey! I-I remember now! This guy! This is a lawyer that was at that office Mia worked at! I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis!
Right! That guy!
Hmm... The police have pretty much made up their minds that Mr. Edgeworth did it. And Mr. Edgeworth won't tell us anything. I guess we could go look for clues down by the lake?
Thoughts... Thoughts... Yeah, why won't Mr. Edgeworth tell us anything? And... and... And why did he refuse to ask for our help? What a jerk!
Nick... This person was a lawyer at Grossberg's office. Let's go talk to him! Mr. Grossberg, I mean, not the dead guy.
Hey, Nick. Look at the wall.
Well then let's take them back to our office! He won't miss them!
Then, can we take that wooden bear?
Hey, Nick! I want a desk like that in our office too!
Huh? I meant for me!
Why is the wall there a different color?
Huh. What happened to it?
I bet he gave it to some romantic interest! Love blooms eternal, Nick!
I think our Charley is cuter.
We should put things on our client table too.
We could put out candy, or gum.
Lotta!
Bingo...?
Hey!
But you can't really tell who that is shooting.
What...?
Whaaaaaaa!?
L-Lotta!
She left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick?
Looks like the police have given up their questioning.
Aah! N-Nick! I think Santa's mad at you!
Nick... you know Santa!? Wow... Nick and St. Nick... Hey! I see the connection!
Wow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice!
I'm his partner, Maya Fey. I'm, uh, the little sister.
N-no, I'm not Nick's sister, I'm my older sister's little sister...
Hey, Nick, benches! Let's take a break... maybe have a dog?
Wimpy city boy! You should try standing under a freezing waterfall some time!
The "Original" Samurai Dogs, no less.
Nick, you're wasting your time. Last night was Christmas Eve! He was with Kiyance, obviously! He wouldn't have been standing out here in the cold!
?
Um, Nick? Why would Larry know Edgeworth...?
Huh? You know Mr. Edgeworth, Larry?
Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Umm... umm... tell me about the dogs!
W-why are they Samurai Dogs? I... I mean they kind of look gourd-shaped.
Ouch...
Err... Something about that just seems... wrong.
The "big news"...?
G-"Gourdy"...?
So, Mr. Edgeworth was your classmate, Larry?
Wow... I never knew.
Like his father...?
Wow. Wait... You said "defense lawyer"?
Wait a second! But Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecuting attorney!
No, no--he's a "prosecuting attorney." That's like the total opposite of a defense lawyer!
Nick...?
Umm... what's "Gourdy"?
A... monster?
Wow! It's r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster!
I wish I could have seen it!
O-one million...?
Hey Nick, show me that article once more. "I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water..." How romantic! And cool! I mean, to think, a real monster!
R-really!?
L-Larry! You mean you don't know what a camera is!?
Well...
... Not a Gumshoe in sight.
Lotta Hart... it has to be.
So you didn't shoot him?
Her little sister, yes!
...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?
... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg?
Thank you!
But wait... What does this case have anything to do with Mr. Edgeworth?
Wh-what!? His father!?
She said she was more worried about me than anything.
That's what she said.
Yes... she said it was to photograph "shooting stars."
Mr. Hammond...?
Wait... This is a photograph of my mother!
My mother... ...
Detective Gumshoe was really worried about you!
...!
Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
December 28?
Um, Nick? What odes that mean?
What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?
So, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps.
I know! You want us to defend you!
Nick...!? ...
...or joke-like about it!
Nick! Do it over!
Pay him back...?
E-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary!
... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes.
Well, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.
Eek!
What!?
She can do that!?
Huh? What happened to the other witness?
Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.
... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?
Not a single case?
Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?
And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.
That's pretty ruthless...
Uh huh?
Oh...
I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.
I think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...
I'm really sorry. I'll try my best!
What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?
Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?
What do we do?
Well said, Nick! You're the man!
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!
Huh? Wh-what?
Oh... Sorry. It's no good.
I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?
It's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.
It's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.
It's okay Nick.
I don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...
Really...?
Uh, Nick... contempt...?
I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?
Wow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!
I dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!
But... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...
I guess we'll just have to bluff it.
Hey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!
Sorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...
Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!
It... was me.
No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!
Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?
Answer me, Lotta!
I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!
N-Nick! There must be something we can do!
B-but... but didn't Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn't say that in her testimony, did she?
No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!
Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!
Hey! Nick, it's you! I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief...
... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry.
O... okay.
No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning."
Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?
I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something.
None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training.
I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again...
It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I'm a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...
But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium...
Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?
Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you?
My... mother. ...
I want to see Gourdy, too!
Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!
So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?
How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?
Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they?
What? Really!?
Sorry... I'm fresh out of ideas.
Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go.
Those interrogators were really mean! They were like "okay, what did you do THIS time?" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?
Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.
Huh?
Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!
We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.
I-I was kidding!
Sure!
Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.
Well... Not much more than that, no.
Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.
Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun.
... Right. I'll behave.
I don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal?
Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think.
Don't waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He's bringing in another witness!
Let's come back later.
There aren't many cops around today, are there?
Mmm...
Hey, it's Lotta!
Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.
Right!
All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!
What!?
Wh-what information!?
Uh...
Wh-what should we do, Nick?
Nor do we have any money, anyway!
There's never a lack of drama when you're on a case, is there, Nick?
Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering...
What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!?
Okay, Nick, let's get hunting!
Gourdy? I sure do!
We're searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don't you get it!?
Th-the Steel Samurai, Nick.
Wow! That's really impressive she could find those for you!
I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the "War of the Eyeglasses"!
Huh? What? You mean, you don't know the War of the Eyeglasses?
Our local fair used to do it ever summer... Huh, I guess we were the only ones.
... Something about this Steel Samurai just doesn't work for me.
Hmph. Still a novice, aren't you, Nick. Really... True connoisseurs like Cody and me don't fall for this kind of stuff.
What's this machine?
Huh, neat.
Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!
No? Really?
Transferred?
Compressor?
Oh. And here I thought you'd inflated it by yourself.
Do you think Gourdy really exists?
... It’s always so quiet, here. I wonder if the boat shop is closed for good?
I get it.
Umm... no, nothing.
It is a little chilly... I... I think I have to sneeze!
Whaaa-cho!
...
Oh... I'm sorry.
Nick... pay the lady.
Huh?
What are you going to do if Gourdy doesn't exist?
What!?
Was it a good one?
A y-yoofoh...?
Huh? So you really are a university student?
Right...
Sorry, sorry!
His motive?
Poor Edgeworth...
Say, Detective Gumshoe. Do you know "Gourdy"?
Well... we're looking for him.
Eeek!
Oh... Detective Gumshoe is scaring me, Nick.
Nick! Try telling him sooner next time!
H-huh!?
Really!?
Okay, give us the goods!
M-M-Missile?
Hey, he's cute! Look, Nick! Cute dog!
Umm... I can't make up my mind, Nick. They all seem so perfect!
He's sooooo cute!
He's sooooo cute!
Why's he named "Missile"?
Do you like fishing?
Hey, Nick...
Missile's been acting strangely...
Wh-what's wrong, Missile?
Eeeeek! Missile! Misssssssssssile!
Wow. He ate every single one.
Hey Larry! Look, it's Missile! Isn't he cute?
There's a "big boss" in charge of your hot dog stand? Nick! Maybe the stand is a front for a mafia money laundering scheme!!!
Oh, right!
I'm not after small fry. I'm after the biggest fry of them all... Gourdy!
To save Edgeworth, yes!
Mmm. Okay, Nick, this looks like a good spot!
Time to do some fishing!
Oh...
Mmm...
...!!! N-Nick...! How could you!
Hmph! Some jokes are better left untold.
Okay... Watch this, Nick!
Here we go! Ack! M-my leg!
Sorry, Lotta...
Nick, pay her.
Hey, Lotta!
He's a K-9 police dog! His name's "Missile."
Hmm... I hadn't thought about that.
Lotta, wait... For catching Gourdy...
Yes! I mean... yes, it's a fishing pole!
Thanks!
Hey, Lotta, look at this: It's a metal detector!
Oh... I hadn't thought about that.
N-Nick! It's beeping! The metal detector's found something!
Why do I have to check it out? ... Nick. Look!
I thought it was Gourdy...
Oh.
Well, we might as well take it with us now that we've found it.
Now that you mention it, didn't he say he had a meeting to go to?
Umm... So, the tank and the Steel Samurai you were trying to fill up flew away... What happened next?
And when did you find it?
So you didn't know about what happened?
That's too bad...
A mystery...?
Larry... Nick is your lawyer.
Tell us! Tell us!
What!? Off into Gourd Lake?
I wish I could have seen it!
What!? I haven't seen any monsters yet!
That won't work in court either, Nick...
No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy!
Hmph. We almost had her duped, too.
R-really, Nick!?
That won't work in court either, Nick...
Larry's air tank...?
Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?
Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
Poor Lotta...
Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted.
Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick!
...! Wait... so you have another photo?
... Poor Lotta...
The "legend"...?
Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.
Hey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about!
Well, let's go check it out anyway!
Eeeek!
... N-Nick... you handle this.
Y-yes!?
P-pasta?
N-Nick! What was that!?
N-Nick? What's the "Wet Noodle"?
He fell asleep...
You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here!
...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish.
Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa!
Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick!
Wow, he has a television in here, too.
Look, a little safe! Hmm... ... It's locked.
Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning!
Hello!
He ignored me!
Her name?
Neat! So the parrot's name is "Polly"!
Too bad all she can say is "hello"...
The "secret words"...?
Polly! Polly! What's your name?
Hee hee! Cute!
Y-yes!
D-dough tossing?
P-pasta wrangler? The west? I-isn't pasta from Italy?
Y-yes!
Nick...?
How long do we have to keep up this all-in-the-family charade?
Nick... This isn't going anywhere.
Everything... important? Hmm, I wonder... Polly! What's the number to the safe!?
Alright!
Heh heh. See, Nick? All it takes is a little clever thinking!
Quick, Nick! Write that number down!
What did he say?
We need to know earlier than that...!
N-Nick! Now's our chance to clear things up!
And I'm not Meg, either!
Please, help us!
Please, mister...
What's that?
Uh oh... now he's grumpy.
N-Nick! Are you sure about this?
I... guess so.
Y-yes!?
Er...
Yes? Yes!?
Whaaaat!? Tell us! Tell what you saw!
Indigo... Blue?
Really...?
I think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question.
Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
H-huh!? What did she just say, Nick?
Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...?
Oh...
He locked the door, from the other side.
Do you know who that old man is, Detective?
Hmm... sounds suspicious!
What!?
You seem surprised!
Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
H-huh!?
N-Nick! You think he might be!?
All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!
Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.
Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick!
Nick! I found out where the file is!
Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!
Nick... it's locked.
Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Wow... these are all case reports!?
I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.
Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.
That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!
What!? Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?
Wow... that was some earthquake!
That would be scary like that, in the dark!
The survivors...?
That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.
Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!
"Miles"...!
So he was on the elevator with his father!
Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!
Hammond... the victim in our case!
Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?
Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...
Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.
Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!
B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!
N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!
Nick! Do we have evidence...?
Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!
A... are you sure?
Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...
Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!
Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!
Larry was at the lake that night?
Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?
I see...
That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!
What's wrong, Nick?
Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!
Well, Nick?
Sorry... I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...
What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now!
Wh-what's wrong, Nick?
Huh?
Huh? Yeah, of course I remember...
What do you mean?
Yes!?
Right! I mean... is this safe?
...
Right, Nick!
Uh, Nick? Something on your mind?
Nick, are you sure about this...?
N-Nick! How could that be!? Wasn't the old man holding the pistol!?
That was easy, Nick! What I'm worried about is what you're thinking!
Yay, Nick! You did it!
And what about Larry! That was something else! Even von Karma didn't know what to do with his testimony! Larry really helped us out!
I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel like it's us on trial instead of our clients!
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth?
Don't look so pained! I mean, it looks like you're probably going to get off the hook! You could try to smile just a little...? Relax!
What was Mr. Edgeworth talking about...?
Do you really think Mr. Edgeworth killed...?
Nick...
S-swooning? Me? Oh... Oh, yes. I do remember feeling faint.
We have our own questions for him! Let's come back later.
Don't forget, okay?
Oh... really?
When does he work, anyway?
You did! If you weren't there, Larry, I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth would have been found guilty!
Way to spoil the mood, Larry.
Nick?
Edgeworth and... who else? You mean me right?
Not... me? ... B-but why you, Larry!?
Hmph. Enough with the silent treatment!
Nick... Why do you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much? I mean, he's changed recently, true. But when we first met him, he was kind of jerk, don't ya think?
Wait... Was that when you two were classmates?
Whaaaat!? Hey, hey, Larry. What's he talking about?
Hmph. Okay, Nick. Out with it! I'm going to hear this story today, and that's final!
A c-class trial!?
Lunch money?
Huh, I see.
So... they thought you did it?
Trial...?
Wow... I had no idea!
You did a good thing, Larry!
The DL-6 Incident...
That's so sad!
I guess he didn't want to see his old friends...
...! Wait... You don't mean...? That's why!? That's why you became a defense attorney!? To meet Edgeworth!?
Nick! We have to save Mr. Edgeworth if it's the last thing we do, okay?
First, there's that rental boat shop caretaker. We need to find out who or what he is!
Um, Mr. Edgeworth? I heard the story about the class trial...
You... don't remember?
Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 4th grade...?
Nick. I think you're the only one who really remembers.
Mr. Edgeworth, didn't you know? That trial was the reason Nick became a defense attorney!
One suspect was apprehended in your father's murder, right?
So, he's like my sister was to you, Nick.
Perfectly, huh?
But... but that's...
H-he's right! Now's no time to be praising the enemy, Mr. Edgeworth!
Nick, he noticed.
Poor Mr. Edgeworth!
N-Nick! No! Th-that's a photo of his father! Don't show him that!
Oh! Detective Gumshoe!
You mean, the boat shop caretaker?
... Detective Gumshoe sure is... active today.
Eek!
The woods?
I guess Lotta's in a 'lotta' trouble...
"Eyesore"!?
I guess Larry's been too busy with the trial to show up for work...
This lake sure likes to cause problems, doesn't it.
I mean, everything that happened here turned out to be a lie! Gourdy was a lie, and the charges against Mr. Edgeworth were all lies.
I mean, I'm glad the charges were all lies, but still.
No one's going to sit here on a cold day like today. Well, unless they were eating a Samurai Dog!
...? You seem troubled, Nick.
He was pretty happy about saving Mr. Edgeworth.
That old caretaker got away...
I never imagined he might be the real murderer! ...
Mr. Grossberg! This is no time for idle reminiscing! Mr. Edgeworth's trial ends tomorrow!
What do you think Mr. Grossberg was doing here anyway?
Nick! The forest! There's someone in there!
They must be looking for the caretaker!
The caretaker must have run for the hills, huh?
He didn't seem like a bad person...
Nobody's home.
Hey! It's Polly! I wonder where your owner's gone, Polly?
I can't believe he'd run off and leave his poor parrot to fend for herself!
It doesn't look like he used this kitchen much.
I guess the whole pasta restaurant thing was a lie.
Say, Nick. Don't people usually put pictures of fish up on the wall to boast about them?
Right... but don't all the fish on the wall here look really puny to you?
Except the one that got away from us was the caretaker! And we did see him!
Maybe we should bring it to Detective Gumshoe.
Well, we can just leave him the metal detector in exchange!
Aah!
Huh? Oh... N-never mind.
Just, when I saw the TV, I remembered... They're showing a Pink Princess special this week...
See? That's why I didn't want to tell you.
That reminds me, Nick! Polly here knows the number to this safe, right?
Polly, what's the number to the safe?
Let's open it, Nick! C'mon!
Aww... But, hey! He keeps it locked, right? So there must be something of value in there!
Okay, Nick, let's see what's in there!
A letter? Aww... boring!
N-N-Nick! Why would Mr. Edgeworth's name be on here...?
What do you think it means, Nick?
But who could have written that letter? And... what does it mean, to "get revenge on Miles Edgeworth"...?
I wonder why the caretaker didn't take the letter with him?
Maybe I should take care of Polly, Nick?
Well... okay... Sorry, Polly. He says I can't take you.
One day left, Nick.
Well, no time to waste! Let's get going!
You would know best, Nick! Just do what you do! That should work.
This is all tied to the DL-6 Incident... We'd better find out as much as we can about that murder before tomorrow!
Stop showing me stuff and let's get cracking! We only have today to get to the bottom of this!
Huh... But, isn't that strange? This letter tells him to "get revenge on Edgeworth"... Why would he want to take revenge on you?
What kind of dream?
... B-but... That's just a dream, right? Right?
What!?
Who is that old guy, anyway!?
So, he was following this letter, then?
It also says: "This is your last chance!"
Wh-what is it!? Do you know who he is!?
Yogi?
What are we doing to do, Nick? What can we do!?
...! There is, Nick! There is someone else who knows about DL-6!
No kidding! I can't believe you're not!
It's M-Mr. Edgeworth! He... He... *sob*
It's o-only a dream! Only a dream!
W-what...?
W-well...
N... No! I don't believe it!
My sister...?
And...?
I see...
That's when my mother left us. Everyone called her a fraud.
B-but how could von Karma know about Mr. Edgeworth's past like that? Even Mr. Edgeworth thought it was just a nightmare!
Faulty evidence?
Wow.
Really!? He doesn't take vacations!? Like... go to the sea, or, uh, to the mountains? Don't tell me he's never been to Europe!?
What a creep!
Huh? Sorry about what?
But, why kill Robert Hammond?
But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter?
Whaaaaaat!? But... but that means...! Th-the one who told Mr. Yogi to kill was...
But, why kill Robert Hammond?
But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter?
What do we do, Nick? von Karma is going to bring up DL-6, you can bet on it! What if Mr. Edgeworth pleads guilty to DL-6!?
B-but, Nick! Mr. Edgeworth admits it himself! His father must have lied to protect him, beyond the grave...
There's hardly anyone here...
Sounds like Detective Gumshoe is pounding the pavement for real! Um, we were wondering if we could check out the Records Room again...
von Karma...?
N-Nick! Let's hurry!
Dusty as always!
What's wrong, Nick?
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Huh? One of the drawers here is open.
The label says, "Unsolved Cases: Evidence"
Nick! The file for DL-6... it's completely empty!
Eeek! v-v-von Karma!
Huh?
W-w-what are you saying!? We see each other every day, don't we? We're Miles Edgeworth's defense team!
Uh, umm... Mr. Edgeworth was your student, right?
(Creep!)
...! S-so you admit it! You... you wrote Mr. Yogi this letter!
N-Nick! What is that thing!?
Nooooooooooo!
N-Nick! Run!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
...
...
... The letter! Did he take it?
... I... I couldn't stop him. I jumped as fast as I could, but one shot from that thing knocked me out cold. I'm useless. I'm not good as a lawyer, or a medium! I can't even call my sister. Not even now, when we need her the most. I wish I hadn't woken up at all.
S-s-sorry, Nick! I only touched your shoulder! I guess the "shock" hasn't worn off from my run-in with the stun gun yesterday. Anyhow, today's the last day of the trial! Good luck, Nick!
Sorry! I'm sorry! I just thought I'd ch-cheer you up with a pat on the back...
Right. Good idea.
Nick! How are you going to prove it!? How can you prove that he's Yanni Yogi?
Nick! What are we going to do!?
Wh-what is it, Nick? No... you're not going to...!?
Nick... this is crazy!
What are you going to do, Nick?
Hmm...
R-right! Uh... What do I say?
Pol-ly, Pol-ly. Have we forgotten something?
Um, Polly? Have we forgotten something?
...! Th-that's not what you're supposed to say! Forgot! Something we forgot!
Uh oh. It's not working, Nick! She won't say it!
Polly! Polly! What's your name?
Nick! Don't you think you're taking the bluffing a little too far?
Nick! We're getting closer! One more! If we can just get one more piece of evidence...!
Huh? The safe? Why?
Polly! What was the number of the safe in the shack?
Nick! We're getting closer! One more! If we can just get one more piece of evidence...!
W-well... I guess we should try to get some information out of her! We need to show the judge that her owner is Mr. Yogi!
Nick! He looks totally different!
Nick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!
Nick, are you sure!?
... ...? Nick? What are you doing?
Your case... for what?
Please... Please...
Nick! Take a look at this!
Look... doesn't this make you think...
Nick! Take a look at this!
Look... doesn't this make you think...
What are you doing, Nick!? Why aren't you raising an objection!?
What?
Nick...?
N-no... But you said you'd do it, Nick! You said you'd get Edgeworth declared innocent!
Nick...
... Oh no... He's confessing... ...
What?
A-are you okay? Nick?
Nick...?
Oh no...
N-nothing!
Hey, Nick.
I just thought of something really crazy.
Remember what Mr. Grossberg said yesterday?
Wow.
What if von Karma didn't take that vacation because of shock...
Which would mean...
He was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident!
It was... von Karma!
Nick! Now's no time to be holding on to that trump card! The trial's almost over!
Nick! Let's find out who his doctor is!
So... so what, Nick? Did von Karma pull the bullet out by himself!? That's insane!
Nick...
Nick! What does this mean...?
N-Nick...? Umm... If this if your final proof, don't you think you should choose a little better?
I think you'd better dig out the right evidence, and quick!
Nick! Nick! We did it! Did you see his face!? von Karma looked even paler than usual! He's pretending to be all cool, but inside you crushed him, Nick! Crushed! I gotta say, I'm impressed.
I know, I was on the verge of tears the whole time, myself. But now it's all just a good memory!
I know! I know! Try "thank you."
I think you could have done better than that!
You got a lot to learn, Edgeworth!
See, Mr. Edgeworth? You should take a lesson from Detective Gumshoe! That's how you say "thank you"!
Don't worry. Take it a little at a time. You'll get used to it.
Lotta!
N-N-Nick! Wasn't that exactly the amount of lunch money that was stolen from Mr. Edgeworth in school!?
Now, now, Nick. It was fifteen years ago! Don't you think the "statute of limitations" has run out, Mr. Edgeworth?
Hey, photo time! Let's go!
Good morning, Nick. You were really impressive yesterday. Seeing you... It made me think about what I'm doing here. I'm a spirit medium... in training, of course. I wanted to help Mr. Edgeworth too. I wanted to help you. But I couldn't. I was useless. So, I've decided to go back to my training. I'll become a full-fledged spirit medium, for starters. I couldn't say it to your face, so I left this letter. Goodbye, Nick.
Hey! N-Nick!
...
...
Yeah. It's hard being a spirit medium who can't talk to spirits. And... I think you'll do fine without me, Nick. Be good... okay!
What?
Huh?
You heard my sister...?
Well, that's my sister for you. Detective Gumshoe helped, and Mr. Grossberg, and even Larry... I'm the only one who couldn't help. I was useless, Nick.
Huh? I-I didn't do anything! All I did was wander around in a daze...
E-evidence?
A bullet...?
Nick...
... ... I'll be back soon.
I'm going to complete my training, and come back!
Of course you will. You can't run that office by yourself! You're hopeless!
... Huh? S-sorry, Nick. I guess I don't understand.
It's okay. You don't have to try and cheer me up. But... One day, I'll come back and be useful, I promise!
So... bye.

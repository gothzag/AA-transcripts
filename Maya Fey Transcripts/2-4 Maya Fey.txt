Alright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!
Yup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? "The Nickel Samurai"!
OK, that's it! From now on, it's "The Nickel Samurai"! All the kids watch it!
Nah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.
Hey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!
Aw, give it a rest, Pearly!
Aaaaah... It's like a dream!
Yeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?
Um, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.
Hey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.
Argh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?
Hey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, "Eat me now!"
That chandelier is really something, isn't it?
Hey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?
If this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.
Nick, you've got to cut that "news only" habit out. Your new show is going to be "The Nickel Samurai!" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?
Well, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?
What can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!
Don't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!
Well, a growing girl needs her nutrients!
Hey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?
Oh, I see.
You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.
I can't believe it either, but for a different reason!
Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show... With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.
This year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!
He's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.
With a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.
Yeah! A ninja who becomes a star!
You know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.
Umm...
Uh, um... Well...
I thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.
...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?
Hmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.
Alright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? "Nickel Samurai Smelting!"
You mean the "big confession" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?
Bah.
Yeah, of course!
OK! For great justice!
Ooh... I'm all ready to use my special "Samurai Power".
WHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?
Th-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...
But that outfit...
Wow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!
I mean, since we're here, you know?
But I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...
We're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!
Don't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.
What incident? What did you do?
You? A bodyguard?
M-Mr. Edgeworth?
Um... So, did something happen?
...Hey, Nick.
Let's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!
Huh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!
So listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...
Yay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.
Alright! Then, let's try...
Ack!
Um, yeah... That's me.
A call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...
Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?
Heeelp! Niiiiick!
Mmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!
Nnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?
"D-De Killer"!? You mean like an "ASSASSIN"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)
A-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...
...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?
A... A business transaction?
...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls... ...Sis...
...Ask my...!
...Sis... Ask my sis!
Nnngh... I'm starving... I could really go for some apple pie... I mean, at a time like this, sweets are the only way to go! I have to stay positive! He promised he wasn't going to kill me! I'm not going to die! (Sis... I wonder if you're with Nick right now...)
What's this...? It feels like there are a lot of glass bottles here. And these... They feel like barrels. I'll pass... Too bad I'm really hungry, and not really thirsty.
There's all sorts of things piled up here... But it's too dark to see.
Drat, it's locked. (Hmm, but this door's lock seems easy enough to open...) On TV, the hero always uses a plastic card or a stiff piece of cardboard... ...Then "click", they magically open the door. (I wonder if there's a card like that around here I could use...)
Huh? Someone dropped a card here... It kinda looks like... a business card... But there's no name on it. Hmm... It's a picture of a seashell, I think... What a strange card.
I can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there...
If I don't do something to the door first, I don't think I'll be "moving" anywhere...
Ah! That's it! This shell card! If I use this, maybe I can get the door open! This might be my key out of here! I had a feeling this card might be useful... I'm such a genius! Alright. Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Kidnapper...
(I did it!) OK... Now I'm getting the heck out of here! (I shouldn't keep Nick waiting... Or worried.)
Heh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an "assassin", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found...
Sounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around!
I've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around...
Wh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here!
Wow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm...
... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered...
What is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...?
Oh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here.
There's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, "With love... Celeste" I bet this could be a clue...
...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something...
It's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...?
Unngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there...
I can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there...
Eeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
He is...?
Ways... You mean...
"D-D-D-D-Dead"!?
N-No way... You're lying... I mean... An assassin...?
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!
"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!"
I thought you'd come. I knew you would. Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever! I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. ...There's so much I want to write, but I don't think I have a lot of time left. Pearly, you're there too, right? Make sure you help Nick, OK? Someone's gotta watch out for the helpless lunk. ... Um... That's it for now, Nick. I guess I'll talk to you guys later.
Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever!
... I'm... sooo... hungry...
You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!?
...What the!? I'm not an item!
Oh, Nick! I knew you would come through! You got Engarde convicted, like I knew you would... And on top of that, you even rescued me!
Whatever, whatever. Look, it's over, OK? Besides, if I did croak, I would just come back and haunt you like a bad ghost through Pearly!
... Th-Thanks a lot... Nick.
Oh, Mr. Edgeworth.
Hey... It looks like you've made some real progress, Mr. Edgeworth!
Heh...
Alright! I think it's time we got out of this depressing place!
Food, Nick! FOOD! Grub! Chow! I'm starved! I'm so hungry even you look like a nice, juicy burger on a bun to me, Nick!
Don't be silly, Nick.
This case messed up that awesome evening, and got in the way of my gourmet food. So I've decided that we have to make it up by having another feast!
C'mon, Nick! FOOOOOOD!
Amen to that, pal! Amen!
What?
Hahaha, you think?
Yeah, it was really scary. I felt so hopeless. So to keep my mind off of things, I drew a picture!
... Hmm... You know, I don't know where it went...
W-Well, it's alright! It wasn't anything important anyway.
Huh!? But Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even eaten anything yet!
Hm? Yes, Pearly?
P-Pearly! Would you cut it out already!? You're embarrassing me!
As if you need to ask! Everyone say, "Thank you" to Nick!
Yeah, Nick!
Go on! It's been a while since I heard you say it. I've been busy being a hostage and all.
You really came through for me, Nick! I had to hide that letter, but I knew you'd find it. I really feel like I've been living on the edge lately. I mean, I've escaped death three times now! Pretty cool, huh? I feel like a pro!

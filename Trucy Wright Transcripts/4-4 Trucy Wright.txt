Hey, Apollo! Look, on TV! Look! Look!
Whoa! Look at that! He's the last Gramarye, alright! Amazing!
Apollo, you should be watching this!
Lawyers are supposed to write things in "records", Apollo, not journals. And why now? That case was three months ago.
That's right! Uncle Valant did that illusion, too! But you're missing him on TV right now!
That's going to be great! I'm so there! You and Daddy are coming, too!
I've got the tickets and everything! Here's yours, Apollo.
Hi there, stranger!
Yay! Pudding! I love pudding! Ooh, it's farm-fresh! And not just one pudding, but three whole cups! I'll have to pace myself.
That's right, Daddy. You're on a top secret mission! You've got to take it easy with the secrets, you know.
Ooh! Maybe you're getting a top secret mission, too! Maybe you can be one of those guys! A spy!
The Jurist System...?
Have you heard of it, Apollo?
Want to have a go at that ring, Apollo?
C'mon, there's no need to be shy! Just slip it on... There!
You're way too tense! You gotta loosen up, there.
You know, I used that trick on stage the other night. Imagine my surprise when I pulled one of my shirts out of the box!
My real Daddy, yup! Zak Gramarye! He disappeared when I was little. I hung that up there so I wouldn't forget what he looked like.
OK, Apollo! I'm going to guess what you're thinking right now!
"Argh! I'm so hungry!"... I'm right, right? Of course I am.
Ack! How did you do that!? You read my mind, Apollo!
That's right!
That's the first rule of a professional: be prepared! You know, I put it on the other day... ...and this strange white substance fell all over me! It was like magic!
Ooh, careful there, Apollo. A lot of people run into that table, you know. Why, some client knocked the pot clean over the other day.
Hmm. Maybe the table is partially to blame...
So, Daddy, what's this "Jurist System" thing?
I've heard of it. Isn't that those people who sit in court in those old courtroom dramas? The ones who get to decide if a guy's innocent or guilty? Do you know, Apollo?
"No more doing whatever you like, Your Honor!"
Wow, you know your stuff, Apollo!
I feel like I'm on some kind of educational TV show! Starring Dr. Wright!
Too true... Everyone's got an opinion, and they just talk and talk and nothing gets decided. Kind of like you, Apollo.
I don't like tests.
Wow! It's like you have a real job!
A simulation, huh... Sounds interesting.
Hey, Apollo, I know you're all excited about that secret mission... ...but what about this!? The "Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show"!
They're not "card tricks"! They're grand illusions! Miracles! The apocalypse! Heaven and Earth will shake!
It's at Sunshine Coliseum! Let's go! Let's go today! We can say hi to Uncle Valant!
Whaaaat!? I can't go by myself! You know I'm not very outgoing!
Yippee! Now you can take me to the coliseum!
He may look cool and calm now, but you should have seen him before!
Are you ready, Apollo!?
For what!? For the Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show!
...What are you talking about, Apollo!? You can't enjoy magic if you're not part of what's going on up on stage! I'll lend you my spare costume if you need one.
No.
Good thinking! No sense wearing yourself out on something too serious!
By "simple", did you mean that the defendant is...
Go for it, Apollo! It's just a test case, anyway. No sweat!
Well, time's a wasting!
...What's this, Daddy? Isn't that silk hat the Gramarye seal?
Thanks! It's great! But... ...today isn't my birthday.
Yippee! So it's plastic!
Can I open it, Daddy?
Huh!?
...... Well, why didn't you just hold on to it until then?
That seems odd to me. I mean, isn't a signature intended to show ownership? What's the use if no one can read it?
...Oh! I never thought of it that way!
......
Maybe I should complain? I'm sure that guard has better things to do than stand there pretending he doesn't see us.
Like shouting, "Oh, waiter!" and they're standing right behind you? Oh, guaaaaard! Is our client going to be much longer?
...Huh? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
...... I'm nervous, Apollo.
Th-That's right. OK...
Eeeeeeeeek! She passed out!
That's "Magic Panties", Apollo!
...I can tell you mine, if you'd like, Apollo?
And I'm Trucy Wright.
Well, the other day this tourist from out of town stopped to ask me directions.
You did good, Apollo!
L-Look! She's doing her nails!
Stop looking so wistful and read it, Apollo!
I wonder if Drew Studio is the scene of the crime?
What a pretty business card. Looks like a postcard, almost.
That seems odd to me.
Why write your name on the front and back of the card? Why not use the space on the back for a self-portrait! Or a caricature! Then people would remember what you look like, too.
Here, give me one of your cards, Apollo...
Medical office...? Is she OK?
Guess we should come back.
It's like life imitating art... Or, maybe, it's the other way around... Hmm. But the tape on the ground there... It's a bit jarring...
Apollo! Look at all those paintings!
It's OK, I'm just looking. Huh? Apollo... Look at this one.
But, that's odd. The rough part doesn't look like the rest of the painting at all.
...All the paintings have a really different style, too.
Ema! Long time no see!
Misham...
It was funny, though. She seemed more like a victim than the kind of person who could commit murder.
P-Poisoning...?
Ah ha! So the poison was in here! This is my first time seeing a real poisoned mug of coffee!
What!?
...... I like you better when you tell us stuff.
Eek, Apollo! Th-That's where the body was!
Wow! A true artist to the end!
Hey... There's a painting hidden back here!
What if it's embarrassing somehow, and he didn't want anyone to see it!?
Huh. It's so... normal!
Huh? What is it, Apollo?
...?
Huh? What is it, Apollo?
...?
That letter box looks funny sitting inside a room like this.
Impressive that someone still writes letters in this day and age. Or wrote, rather.
I wouldn't mind taking a closer look at those paintings. I just love oils! You know, how they're so thick? Is that the word?
Yeah... And what's going on with this half-finished one?
...That's what's so weird. The sketched part doesn't really fit the finished parts.
Let's take a closer look.
But... the rough sketch part doesn't fit the other parts.
Let's take a closer look! Why are two of the paintings identical?
...Guests?
Is this desk for painting, Apollo?
...Drafting?
...Wow, painting is harder than I thought.
What is all this equipment here for? It doesn't look very artistic, really.
Oh, do you think I could borrow this? I want to cut a quarter in half to make a trick coin!
But these cost like 50 bucks at the magic shop!
Ooh! I know how to do that! You take a pot of boiling water, and hold the envelope up to the steam. The glue melts and it opens! Cool, huh?
You're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together. ...Huh? The postmark on this letter is from seven years ago!
You're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together.
Hey, Apollo, what's this feather-thingy?
But it doesn't have a pointy end.
Wow, you sure know a lot, Ema.
...I've seen that pose before! It's you, Apollo! See, you're making one of your flamboyant gestures!
Wow, talk about a clue! Let's read it!
Wh-What is it, Apollo!? He didn't write the name of the killer, did he!?
Argh! You had me going for a while there.
And this little girl must be Vera!
Ooh! Cute! Look at the tiny frame, Apollo!
None, apparently. It's empty.
This is a lesson for us all: be sure to check the size when you buy frames!
Very strange indeed. Wait, I know! I'll bet it was poisoned from the time he bought it! Haven't you heard about some kinds of green paint being toxic?
Look at all these paints, Apollo! There's so many! He's got like... twenty kinds of red! We could repaint your suit, Apollo! How about this shade of... green!?
So, this, um, Drew Misham was some kind of artist?
Oh? Well, I guess his stuff is kinda pretty. Like that oil painting over there, for instance.
What do you mean, "to anyone"?
What do you mean, Apollo?
Maybe he thought that way was more artistic, you know?
Oh, you mean the killer?
"Basically"...?
She did kind of give off a withdrawn sort of aura...
Her "good luck charm"...?
But why would a shut-in daughter kill her own dad?
Not precisely? What does that mean?
...And died? She poisoned him on the night of his interview!? Wouldn't the reporter see?
Don't forget, flattery will get you everywhere with her, Apollo!
Yeah, what about it, Apollo?
Hey. They're the same!
Wow. It's pretty good!
...I think she's going to help us, Apollo.
Forensic science! I knew your hobby was behind this somehow, Ema!
So, what kind of scientific stuff were you up to?
Wow! Science is amazing!
You should try buttering her up, Apollo. They say flattery will get you everywhere.
Someone opened this, didn't they?
Ah! You mean you were the one who ripped this open!?
Weapon...?
You should try flattering her, Apollo... They say a little praise can open big doors.
But we just did the X-ray detection thing!
Maybe they're worried? Like, what should I have for supper: a hot dog, or a hamburger? ...... You know, I've always wondered about that. Why is there "supper" and "dinner"? Are they different meals or the same thing?
Apollo! That's clearly a porcupinefish!
You know what gets me? They're got all these needles, right? But what's protecting that soft spot on the lower belly there? Nothing!
Apollo, look at this painting. You can see the rough sketch!
Huh? That's funny. Do the rough sketch and the finished painting look totally different to you, too?
Hey, Apollo. This painting, I know it!
It's that story where the old woman is doing the wash in the river... ...and this giant peach comes a' floating on down.
Hey... look there! That stain doesn't look so healthy, Apollo! That must be the "Blue Mountain" stuff we've been hearing about!
Apollo, look! It's been opened once here.
Should I try to get it open and then stick it back shut?
...Ema! Let's ask her!
Atro... huh?
I think I get it. You just spray this stuff on something you want to test, right?
I wanna try, too, Ema! Pretty please?
Yay! Let's give it a whirl, Apollo!
I was just seeing if I got a reaction off of you.
Tell that to those hapless witnesses on the stand!
Too bad. No reaction there.
What is it, Apollo?
I don't think so... The spray probably can't reach that far, you know?
Eeeeeeeeeeeek! A reaction, Apollo!
The inside of that cute little frame! Look!
I'm known to work magic!
Are we going to test for poison again?
I bet she doesn't have a lot of spending money.
See that, there? That's poison.
Don't lick it, Apollo!
No, you won't! You'll die!
Who knows what you do when I'm not watching...
It'd have to be a really small photo to fit in there.
Well, there's one obvious reason. Whoever put poison in the coffee rubbed a bit on here, too!
X-Ray... like the x-rays you get at the dentist?
Huh?
So, basically, it lets you see inside things... like envelopes?
Can I try it out, Ema? Please!?
Alright! Let's give it a spin, Apollo!
Oh, just seeing if I could see through your hair... But it's like lead!
Then I wouldn't need an x-ray machine to see through it!
Layer view...?
Hey! I got something!
Wow! Really?
"The image"? You mean rub the screen?
Hey, I get it! We just keep doing this until we've got the whole thing!
Neat! Let's do some more!
Woo hoo! I'm a big winner!!!
...Hmm. Does this mean I have to buy another one to win?
Ouch. "You lose".
Someone deposited $100,000 into Mr. Misham's account? His paintings must be really valuable!
You bet I do! If you're going to read someone's mail you might as well read it all!
...So it was a letter about payment for one of his paintings.
...And what?
Maybe it had some special significance to him? Well, Ema?
Let's take a closer look. Mr. Misham sure worked on a lot of different paintings. You think his works really go for a 100 grand a piece? Maybe I should take up painting.
I thought so.
Brushel...
Really strange.
It wasn't Valant Gramarye, by any chance, was it?
I guess you gotta have a good business card if you work freelance.
Do reporters take photos too?
Maybe you should try being a prosecutor and a defense attorney! You'd always win!
Woo hoo! This is it, Apollo! The place where magic and dreams converge!
Let's go say hi to Uncle Valant!
Only a performer laughs like that...
Tee hee, Uncle Valant! How's it going? I'm glad to see you, too!
Actually, we came to wish you good luck! And congratulations on your big magic show!
He's not a "creature", Apollo! Poor guy.
You know how hot it is inside one of those suits? He's stuck in there, with only the smell of his own sweat to keep him company. On the verge of passing out, he hands out each balloon as though it were his last!
It's got a big-sounding name, too... "Sunshine Coliseum", was it?
What!? Really!? Yeah, yeah!
Apollo! I can't believe you'd use your power of perception on something like this!
Look, Apollo! A balloon! A hot air balloon!!!
I hope it's a huge success, Uncle Valant!
It was all Gavinners back then, wasn't it?
I don't think lawyers and magicians were really meant to have conversations like this.
Everyone's talking about the big magic show! Is it true that the "Gramarye Miracle" is back after a seven year absence?
Daddy...
...It's OK.
Thanks... Uncle Valant. You know, I'm happy you're doing the show! To think, we get to see the Great Magnifi's illusions again!
I was so little when I last saw one, but I still remember his shows! He did wheelies in a sports car through the air above the audience...! And then sped off to outer spac, faster than the speed of sound!
...And why was that?
Can you tell us about these "performance rights"?
Daddy...
Ah...
Is... that how it works, Apollo?
Daddy...
That's all... very confusing.
Uncle Valant! Do you know where the reporter went?
...Uncle Valant? Is something wrong?
Huh? Um, Daddy gave it to me.
No, no, no. My other daddy, Phoenix Wright!
Whaaaaaaaaat!? Daddy signed this!?
Um, his name was Brushel.
...I think he remembers him!
Um, could you tell us more about him? What did he want?
Let's ask why, Apollo!
Apollo? What was that look just now?
Ooh! Here it comes, Apollo! Uncle Valant's big magic trick!
......
What happened to the big magic...?
Thanks, Uncle Valant!
I think it's time to pay the detention center another visit.
Maybe that reporter?
Are you a reporter by any chance?
Eh? Am I famous?
Eeeeeeeeeeek! That's so not true!
Interview...?
Um... did you come here to interview the guard?
Huh...
So, Mr. Brushel... You're a journalist?
...Y-Yes?
OK...
...Well, I think he probably does.
So, the night of the murder... ...you were at Drew Studio?
...Y-Yes?
I can understand that philosophy, but...
True enough. But don't they give normal tickets away, too?
...What is?
So, you went to do a story on Drew Misham... ...and he'd never had a story done about him before?
Wh-What...?
Well... yes.
...At the supermarket, maybe?
Y-Yes?
Sure, tell us! ...Just for the heck of it.
A forger...?
A forger...?
So, what exactly is a "forger"?
Fakes...?
Well, why not just photocopy them?
So, Drew Misham was...?
So the rough sketch is like practice for the real thing! Like doing a magic trick in front of a mirror before you go on stage!
Oh, yeah. I guess you would.
...Still, it'd be neat to see Mr. Misham's rough sketches. Kind of like what he was drawing when he thought no one was looking.
You should try buttering her up, Apollo! Flattery will get you everywhere, they say!
Let's check it out!
Wow, he really blows! The finished painting isn't anything like the rough!
What do you mean?
Composition?
So Mr. Misham was drawing whatever he wanted before painting over them...?
You're awfully silent all of a sudden, Apollo.
What's wrong, Apollo? You look so serious all of a sudden!
You sure your device isn't leaking some kind of strange radiation?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Th-Th-They're...!!
This rough sketch is only half-hidden by the oil painting.
Still, it's impressive. I wouldn't you could hide such a dark sketch under a little paint.
I'm still waiting for you to get to your point.
So! You're... Vera, right? I'm Trucy! Trucy Wright! That's "Wright" with a "W"! Uh, but not "write", right?
Um! We're... on your side! You can tell us anything! ...Please?
Hmm, not bad, not bad. But I think you'd do better with a little smile, you know? You're so pretty! You need to sell yourself, you know?
...!
That's great, really! It's so cultured!
Oooooh! Really!?
...Is the judge OK? His voice is all raspy, and he's looking around all nervous-like.
Daddy's secret mission!
Prosecutor Gavin sure looks like he's having fun.
"Star Falls!" huh... It's like an old telegram! "Send Money, Over".
But there's no gravity in space, is there? I wouldn't think stars could fall, really.
...I think he's starting his article already.
He sure makes it sound exciting. I guess that's his job.
...The moment when Drew Misham died?
...He's working on his scoop.
Suicide? Poor Mr. Misham... But that means Vera's innocent!
Oh.
Apollo! You think this might be...
Do you think Mr. Misham was writing a suicide note?
It kind of makes me wonder about that letter...
But Apollo! We checked the contents of that envelope yesterday, didn't we?
...?
Hmm. Our chances of breaking his will aren't looking good.
He looks kind of nervous to me, Apollo.
...That testimony left a bad taste in my mouth.
I wonder what this "story" he's talking about is? It must have been good, to get an interview with a famous recluse like that.
Apollo! What's he talking about?
Let's keep thinking, Apollo!
What do you think, Apollo? Everything he's saying seems so... not flawed!
Wh-What is it, Apollo? Your fists are trembling!
He would sign the document, put it in the envelope... and put the stamp on it, right? Then he would put it in his letter box...!
It is a little bit of a stretch, but there's a possibility.
Um...
W-Well...
Uh oh. I think the witness is a bad influence on our judge.
A-Apollo!
A-Apollo!
A-Apollo! Were we wrong the whole time?
Hold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow!
Now's no time for wallowing in self-pity! Let's get thinking, Apollo!
Hold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow!
We can flog ourselves later, Apollo! Now's the time for thinking!
I know that face! That's the "I just had an idea" face!
I kinda agree. I mean, Vera, a forger?
OK... So where exactly does this leave us, Apollo?
Huh? Well then, who was he?
Could you tell us how it happened?
The talent... for making forgeries?
...Do you know about this red envelope?
Wait, Vera! Just one more thing, please! Those three paintings in the studio...
Right. See, we checked them out and we saw what was underneath. We saw the rough sketches underneath the three finished paintings...
B-But lately, we're not doing just law...!
Well, they're not really "gags"...
...Who was Mr. Misham?
What if he was Daddy's Daddy?
I know it's hard for you, but hey, he's a handsome guy.
...Even though she fainted when she saw Mr. Hat.
See!? See!? Isn't magic great?
Apollo...!
Apollo! They're not a "bunch"!
Well, pretty stamps are always better, and you can't beat Troupe Gramarye!
Wh-What's wrong with Prosecutor Gavin? He looks like he just saw a ghost!
...Daddy?
What's going on with Vera? She's staring at Prosecutor Gavin's face again...
Yup! You bet, Daddy.
Oh... Old boy! Um, uh... Here.
I dunno! I just got it over there in the hall. They told me to give it to the "old boy in the blue suit with the spiky hair". They said it was really important!
Ooh! Morning, Daddy!
You OK, Daddy? They picking on you?
Thanks! My first show's today, after all!
......
......
......
......
...Mr. Attorney. Daddy told me about you. He said I could trust you.
So, if I stay here... ...does that mean you'll be my family?
Um... Mr. Attorney?
OK! Say, Daddy?
If I move here, I have to switch schools, right? And I was thinking, I haven't paid for lunches at my last school... for a year. So thanks, Daddy!
Oh, and this office? It's a little blah. A little color goes a long way, you know?
Oh, and Daddy? You got fired from work, right? Don't you worry one bit! I'll work twice as hard! We'll make it through this!
Oh, I'm eight. But don't let appearances deceive you! I'm a young professional! Stick with me and you'll do just fine, Daddy!
...?
...?
...?
...?
I really dig the far out view, Daddy!
So, Daddy, you got fired from being a lawyer, right?
Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy! Wait! Is that "foolish pride"? My other daddy always used to talk about that.
So, here's my idea. We'll make a new office! "Law" just seems so stiff, doesn't it? And no one will be my friend at school that way!
Maybe the problem is calling it an "office". We should run an "agency" instead!
You've got me, don'tcha? I'm a professional!
Yup! After all, I am directly descended from the famous Zak Gramarye!
Oh...! And now I'm directly descended from the famous Phoenix Wright, too!
Daddy? Sure thing, Daddy!
Daddy's so amazing! The biggest star of Troupe Gramarye! And they're big!
Big magic happens when you put Zak and Valant Gramarye together, you know. Once they made a giant waterfall, right there on the stage! And this giant trout swam up the giant waterfall!
I wish I could have seen more of Daddy's magic...
I wonder what'll happen to me, with Daddy and Mommy both gone.
But I have my magic! And a great daddy, even if he is unemployed! You know, I think thing's [sic] are going to be OK!
Yes! Um... It's like that thing they say! "Baby frogs grow up to be frogs"...?
I always thought it was funny, though.
Aren't baby frogs called "tadpoles"...? Maybe they thought it would be easier to understand that way for kids. How stupid!
That's right! Well? Well? Wanna see a trick?
Aw, that's no fun. You only live once, you know?
I can't think of anything more important than magic, myself.
Silly, it was written all over your face!
That's the spirit! ...Ready? Here goes! Ta dah!!!
The Amazing Mr. Hat! Isn't he great?
Doesn't he? Ha ha ha! I'm so glad you like him, Daddy!
Mommy was so pretty... She was like an angel up on stage.
Yep! She was always there with Zak & Valant, smiling! But then... she went away.
It was a grand illusion... but she made a mistake. She vanished... and I guess she didn't know how to get back.
I cried then, a lot. That's when Daddy gave me this. ...Here.
Her name's Thalassa. Thalassa Gramarye.
Hey, Daddy? You won't...
Right! You can't even do magic! You're like a backup plan! Daddy always said to have a backup plan.
Oh, that's Mommy! Isn't Mommy pretty? Wait... you don't want to know more about Mommy, do you, Daddy?
Eeek! I better keep an eye on you, Daddy!
...I'm sorry.
I'm still just training to be a magician. I can't make things disappear yet.
Wait one more year! I'll be able to make it disappear then!
It's OK! After all, we're family! I just hope you're ready! The Wright Talent Agency opens tomorrow!
Me and you... That makes two, Daddy...!
Oh, I'm sure there's something you're good at!
You mean you don't have any tricks? No old standbys? This will not do! A boy should always have a trick or two in his pocket.
That's the spirit! See you bright and early tomorrow, Daddy!
Something the matter, mister?
Oh, I love Zak Gramarye! His magic is the best! I'm his biggest fan!
But no one's been in here except me...
...Daddy, he's got a good hand. ...You might have a chance if you act quick! Better call him soon.
What!? They can't put her on trial without her being here!
They should wait for her to get better and do it then. ...It's so bureaucratic of them!
They've really made an art out of this penalty thing.
They've really made an art out of this penalty thing.
Stiff upper lip, Apollo! You can do it!
And my silk top hat!
...Prosecutor Gavin's on the warpath, isn't he?
I bet I know why. He must be nervous with big brother watching!
Wow, the two brothers together is like a two-man wrecking team!
Does Prosecutor Gavin seem strange to you, too? It's like he's all grown-up...
Well, let's make this testimony count, Apollo!
Daddy...?
Apollo! Motive! He's talking about a motive!
So... what does it mean?
Hang in there, Apollo!
Oh... Old boy! Um, uh... Here.
I dunno! I just got it over there in the hall. They told me to give it to the "old boy in the blue suit with the spiky hair".
What's wrong with Prosecutor Gavin? He looks clammy!
...He must have thought of some evidence, Apollo!
Forgery Justice...? That's not so bad!
Hey! That's Daddy's handwriting...
What!?
...Apollo! Do something...!
Apollo! Did you see that? He's trying to press Prosecutor Gavin!
The victim's "belongings"...?
Apollo...
Daddy used to say something. "If you want to know a man, you have to compete"...
What's wrong, Apollo! Go get him!
...... What is it, Apollo?
Keep going! We'll talk about it later!
No! But you were doing so good, Apollo!
Don't cry, Apollo! ...I'm happy, too. And proud. You did well, Apollo. When I thought about... what if Vera... I...
I knew you'd pull through, Vera! I mean, that's what Apollo was fighting for the whole time! Your future!
Oooh! Look! It's me! I love it! Thanks!
She really captured your essence, Apollo! Well, I think so, at least.
Oh! You mean Daddy. 'Cept he's not a lawyer anymore.
Oh! No, no, no, that's not what I meant...
You know, I knew my real daddy was alive.
I was there, seven years ago, remember? I was the one who helped him "vanish" from the courtroom!
I'm not telling! ...He promised me, that day he went away.
It's OK! Phoenix is my daddy now. Even if he can't really play the piano.
...Oh, and I've got you, too! Even if your voice is kinda loud sometimes.
Hey! Come to think of it... ...where is Daddy? The one who can't play. Do you know, Apollo?
Hmm. I wonder... ...Maybe it's a new mommy!
Hmm? Yes, Vera?
Oh, he's not been knighted. ...Yet! Here goes... do us an impersonation, Mr. Hat!
That's "Magic Panties", Apollo!
I'm glad you're staying with the agency, Apollo! It's like.. like I've found my long-lost, big, little brother! Oh, and don't you worry about Troupe Gramarye! Trucy's on the case! ...Now that I've have this, thanks to Daddy.

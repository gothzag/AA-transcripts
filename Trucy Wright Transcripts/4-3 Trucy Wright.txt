This is so cool! Us, at a Gavinners concert!
Well, I thought Mr. Gavin was really nice! Sending us those tickets at 20% off! They're hard to get ahold of, you know.
Let's head to his dressing room, Apollo! You know, like we're a couple of VIPs. I've always dreamed of being a VIP at a Gavinners show!
Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...
Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!
Yeah, but I'm a girl! I'm supposed to swoon over gods of rock!
I bought all their stuff on the way home from the trial! I got twelve Gavinners albums, and fifteen concert videos!
I got an advance on my next 15-years-worth of allowance.
Mr. Gavin! Thanks so much for the tickets!
You were incredible up on stage, Mr. Gavin!
Lamiroir's singing, right!? The "Siren of the Ballad"?
Ooooh! It's Lamiroir! I'm actually meeting Lamiroir!
He plays piano at all of Lamiroir's concerts! He's cute! And he's a really good pianist.
Lamiroir's so, um, what's that word... Exotic! ...And mysterious!
Huh?
Sights into song... That's so poetic!
I can't wait!
Woo hoo! Nights like this make it all worthwhile, you know!
Good luck, Mr. Gavin!
Let's get back to the concert hall, Polly!
Wow, wasn't Lamiroir amazing? I *sniffle* I even cried a little!
Yeah! That even surprised me, and I'm a magician! What a production!
Is that what they call "risking life and limb for art"? I think he's my new hero!
Well, what are we doing here? Let's get going to Mr. Gavin's dressing room! There's twenty minutes till the last part of the show!
...He seems upset.
So much for risking your life for art...
Well, let's try to talk to him at least.
They are a little thick. I couldn't even stuff a pigeon in those.
Maybe they use it for interrogating bad guys... "'Fess up to what you did, and we'll let you eat that stew!"
It gets worse! See, if the bad guy confesses, they say: "OK, eat it... If you can! See, it's made of plastic!" It's like, you don't know which ones are the real bad guys!
The Gavinners are into chains. It's part of their image.
Ever since they used chains on the cover art for "Gunna Lock U Up".
It'd be cooler if they turned that red light on.
Ooh! A "Cruiser Guitar"! They sold those to commemorate five years of the band.
There's a "Cruiser Bass", and a "Cruiser Drum Set", and a "Cruiser Keyboard"... ...Even a "Cruiser Whistle".
It's for blowing the whistle on criminals!
Lipstick... I'd like to wear lipstick someday.
Daddy won't let me. "Not until I learn to play piano," he says.
Ooh! I want to try it on! "Nothing to see here, move along."
Really? You think so? Hmm... I guess you're right!
Look! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!
It must be her native tongue, Borginese!
That guitar! That's the legendary AA-400! The "Red Badger".
Every aspiring guitarist wants one of these! They even paint their own guitars to look like it.
You should dye your hair "Badger Red", too!
Argh, the stubbornness of age!
Oh?
Oh, we have one of those in my classroom, too!
Maybe they're trying to trick kids into thinking the police are some kind of band.
You mean, the guitar... That wasn't part of the act?
But, it worked really well with the lyrics just then... Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away.
They probably thought it was part of the act. At least, I did.
Try saying that to Mr. Gavin.
Daddy told me there'd be days like these.
W-Wasn't Lamiroir's song incredible!? You worked on it too, right, Mr. Gavin?
You know... I was surprised she could sing in English...
Yippee! Thanks so much!
That's so cool... I'd love to do a collaboration myself some day, or a song...
I know that!
Eeeek! R-Really!? I'll sing 'em every day!
...... Maybe I can be a singing and dancing magician!
Ooh! See, you can excel in more than one thing!
Eh! B-But that... But I... ... What's the big idea!? Making me look like a criminal... It was... a collaboration! I've always wanted to do a collaboration!
Wow... That's beautiful!
Apollo! Where do you think you're going!?
Let's talk to Mr. Gavin while we have the chance!
Oh! There's more?
Woo hoo! Ready, Apollo?
Eh.
Ah, Apollo, you're getting old!
Well, I'm going!
Ooh, a gag order!
Why just us?
...Somehow I don't see us getting back to that crime scene any time soon.
This is no time for navel-gazing! Let's crack this case!
Something the matter?
That's the Blue Badger, the police mascot!
Well, yeah! The Blue Badger is the Gavinners's mascot, too!
I hear those things fly off the shelves.
What's that? It looks like some kind of future-phone!
What's a headset doing on the floor? Wait! Do you think Mr. LeTouse might have been wearing it? Like one of those bodyguards?
There's a great magic trick you can do with one of these!
The "Miraculous Beautiful Girl Escapes the Case" illusion.
So picky!
Never know where clues might be hiding, Apollo! Let's case this joint!
The scene of the crime!
But aren't we involved? Aren't we duty-bound to investigate!?
I'm thirsty, Apollo!
Hmm... How about... this one! A Steel Samurai Soda!
Huh?
Hey! This isn't enough change.
I love that name! "Guilty As Charged"!
Well, why don't we do the opposite! Magician Trucy presents the "Innocent as Charged" tour!
Huh. Looks like nobody's here.
No rest for us, either, Apollo! Let's get rocking! Rock, rock!
Hmm. The stage looks empty.
Oh well. Nothing to do but go to the crime scene, I guess!
Why guess when we can fiddle? Hmm... let's see here...
A healthy curiosity is the key to a good investigation! When in doubt, fiddle! That's what Daddy always says.
That's a case for a contrabass, I think.
It may look like a violin, but it's a completely different instrument!
Hey! Are you comparing me to an instrument? Hmm. I wonder who left it sitting open like that.
Why don't they use a stepladder? I prefer stepladders, really. ...Is that so wrong?
...... They're so much more flexible than plain old ladders!
Wow, that piano looks much bigger close up! Machi played so beautifully...
That's just silly, Apollo! How can you call someone as good as Machi a "pianist"? Why, that's like throwing him in the same class as Daddy!
What a big stage! It's on a whole other scale than the Wonder Bar!
I'd love to do my act on a stage like this some day!
You'll be too blinded by my magic to worry about lights!
Please! Think of poor Lamiroir!
Right!
What's wrong, Apollo? Your mouth is catching flies.
But it's much too small.
......
I didn't do it!
I was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!
It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.
Ooh, what a pretty brooch! Oh, Ema...?
Oh.
Oh...
......
Daddy always says: "Trucy, if you want something go find or borrow it." Oh, and "When in doubt, beg."
Are these... bullet holes?
But there are two holes. Wouldn't that mean two misses?
Ouch... Sounds painful.
Ooh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?
I know. I know! But still, I yearn!
Well then, what are we waiting for? Let's eat!
Actually, it's technically a stepladder.
! ......
...... I still say it's a stepladder.
Let's see... "This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'." ...Looks like a poster for a different show.
D-Don't look at me!
Monitoring?
Ah, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!
I don't think Daddy was ever rich, even when he was in law.
Eek! The flower fell off!
Better not mess with his hair, Ema. It's part of his identity, you know.
Th-That's a body, isn't it?
Eeek! G-Go ahead, Apollo. You first.
Apollo, look at this hand...
Ah... see there? He's holding something! What's this...?
You think it might belong to the killer!?
It must mean something!
Practically!
Eeek! Is that... blood? Umm... Why don't you examine this one, Apollo. You know more about, uh, red stuff than I do. Yep!
Well, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.
Ooh! I wonder what's inside? We... can't open them, can we?
...... I'm never having a birthday party again.
Wow. I wonder who brought this in here? I thought only police were allowed to have one of those.
Wait... If the killer brought a revolver... ...it must mean they had planned this from the start. That's right, right?
You know, Apollo, I was wondering... What's a caliber? And what does the "45" mean?
...But it's not 45 inches, right? That'd be too big. What's the unit of measurement they use, Ms. Science? Well?
Look, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!
...What? I was just saying it's possible.
Hmm... So I'm guessing he didn't know many people here.
One person...? Who?
What are you talking about!?
He's a big man. Or was. I don't think even I would win in a fight with him.
Y-You do?
Whaaaa-!? Hmph. I guess that's what I miss for watching the concert.
What? But that doesn't make sense! You came in when you heard the shot and no one was here? How did they leave the room?
I'm not sure I see the problem. I mean, whenever I go out to eat curry... ...I order it "extra spicy". Just to be sure it's spicy. Of course, I can only ever eat one or two bites.
Ouuuuuch! It's like the shooter's a victim, too!
Hey, no fair! Tell us!
So if it's not a safety pin... ...is it a danger pin!?
...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.
Don't worry! I'm an old hand with firearms. I have one that shoots "Bullets".
Not those bullets, silly! My gun shoots "Bullets, the Magic Cat".
I can tell your expression you've never heard of that trick. It's a great one!
Revolver... Revolver... That sounds a bit like "Wonder Bar"! Especially if you say it really fast!
You know what I always used to think? I used to think the closest sound to "Wonder Bar" was "One Liver"! There's just so many words in the world, Apollo! Isn't it amazing!?
I get it! It must be the key to a guitar case!
...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.
Argh... I suppose...
What do we do, Apollo? She told us to wait...
Oh well, I guess it can't be helped. Let's go.
Time's a wasting, Apollo! We've got a lot of ground to cover!
Of course it will! Let's go!
But it's much too small.
......
I didn't do it!
I was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!
It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.
......
Darn... Maybe there's another one lying around here somewhere.
...Don't be so stingy, Apollo.
Are these... bullet holes?
Well, if there are two marks, they must have missed twice.
Ouch... Sounds painful.
Ooh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?
Yeah... I'll make sure to leave some for her to eat, too.
Actually, it's technically a stepladder.
! ......
I still say it's a stepladder.
Maybe I should take it down before she rips it up.
...Maybe I'll pass then.
Well, you know what I do at loud concerts? I wear earplugs! It really cuts down on the noise.
Ah, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!
But Daddy never had one. I don't think he ever even had money when he was a lawyer.
That's super dazzle-frazzle!
Yeah, it's super, and it makes you feel all dazzle-frazzle!
Oh, Daddy.
I've never tried one.
Hmm... I think I'll stick with my top hat. We have an understanding, me and my hat.
Do you think it belongs to the killer?
Well, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.
I got a present once, from a person in the audience.
Isn't it! Maybe you'll get one someday. ...From someone you defend!
I wonder who brought this revolver in here? It's huge.
No one I want to meet, that's also for sure.
Look, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!
...What? I was just saying it's possible.
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
We... didn't just imagine that, did we?
Hardly!
It's the two leading members of the Gavinners, Apollo! Klavier on vocals, and Daryan on guitar! They're so cool!
Huh? What are they arguing about?
...Sounds like they're having a spat. One of those "differences in musical direction" bands are always splitting up over.
*sigh* Apollo... You really don't know anything about the Gavinners, do you?
Prosecutor Gavin was singing the blues earlier, wasn't he? ...Something about his hog, and his guitar case.
Aren't you going to examine the crime scene, Prosecutor Gavin?
They're not exactly best buddies are they. Ema and Prosecutor Gavin, I mean.
Maybe Prosecutor Gavin can shed some light on things we've found!
I don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?
The Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!
The real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!
They debuted seven years ago with "13 Years Hard Time For Love"... Then came "Love With No Chance Of Parole", and "My Boyfriend Is The Prosecution's Witness". The list of hits goes on and on!
The missed cue... They were arguing about that before...
What's this missed cue you keep talking about?
Um, actually, I didn't notice anything...
What's that...?
Well, we've come this far, might as well go all the way! I've always wanted to learn about the recording industry!
Wow, neat! So, could you, say, hear only the drum part?
...Was something wrong?
Ah... the timing's a little off, isn't it!?
Nothing to do but try, Apollo!
Focus, Apollo! I'll cheer you on!
Here they go again.
It's all experience under our belts! That can't be bad!
And something about your guitar case being busted?
You mentioned it a few times.
Wait, so this key ring...
I actually thought that was part of the show.
......
Well, I was just trying to make sense of everything. First this heart-shaped key ring gets stolen. Then a very expensive guitar flares up on stage. Then Mr. LeTouse dies...
Could it all really be just a coincidence?
What do you think, Apollo?
I mean, either Mr. Gavin's having a really bad day... ...or all this was planned.
I am!
Haven't you noticed a connection, Apollo? ...A curious connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles today?
Slow down there, Polly. You look a wee bit dizzy.
C'mon c'mon c'mon! Let's see it! What's the connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles?
Um, I would say you were close, but really, you're kinda far. Remote, even.
You haven't!?
Well don't just give up! Give it a little more thought!
I do. Everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin today... ...is predicted in the lyrics to this song!
Look, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!
And not just any key ring! A heart-shaped key ring!
And next, his guitar burst into flame.
And then Mr. LeTouse was killed...
Yeah, no kidding!
Eh heh.
Whaaaaaat!? This is yours, Mr. Gavin!?
Apollo! How can you make that "I knew it" face!? This is the key ring that was...
Speaking of trials, I've never heard Mr. Gavin whine in court like he has been today.
Apollo! Mr. Gavin, maybe we can help. Tell us about your troubles today.
Tell us... ...and we'll keep mum about the key ring for now.
I wonder why Mr. LeTouse was holding it?
So the criminal matched their actions to the lyrics?
Mr. Gavin sure is irritable today.
I don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?
The Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!
The real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!
Look, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!
And not just any key ring! A heart-shaped key ring!
And next, his guitar burst into flame.
And then Mr. LeTouse was killed...
Eh heh.
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
......
You know, he did look sort of familiar...
No, that's not it. ...Sorry, I don't remember.
Wasn't he saying he had to break his case because he couldn't get it unlocked? I could open a lock like that in 10 seconds, easy! He should have given me a call.
Handcuffs? 20 seconds, tops!
Ah... Lamiroir!
But wasn't Mr. LeTouse your interpreter...?
Actually, Mr. LeTouse was...
Huh!
B-But Mr. LeTouse is Lamiroir's manager! That's not fair to her! I mean, isn't she a related party?
Look! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!
It must be her native tongue, Borginese!
I've never even heard of it...
You don't say! You know, my daddy plays piano in a restaurant!
Image is everything when you're a star! I know a bit about that, of course...
She's not all image, though! Her songs are lovely! A real "landscape painter in sound"!
She travels the world, turning the sights she sees into music! That's the secret to your music's beauty, right?
Oh, I use your songs all the time in my stage act. ...I don't have to pay royalties for that, do I?
They even call you the "Siren of the Ballad", right?
Your pianist... Machi, was it? He's cute! Like a porcelain doll...
It's like a fairy tale, almost...
Was Mr. LeTouse from the Republic of Borginia, too?
Huh? Apollo?
H-How?
He said "siren"... Really?
Well that explains the brooch we found. It was Lamiroir's!
Is something wrong, Apollo?
But Lamiroir, we...
What do you mean by "impossible"?
...What's gone?
Eh...
Whaaaaaaaaaat!?
Well, you seem pretty sure of yourself, Mr. Gavin.
Well, you heard the man. Let's get searching!
Geeter? Who's Geeter!?
Hmm. Does something seem different to you, Apollo?
Let's check it out!
I'm not sure that's all that important right now. Let's check out that thing in the middle of the stage!
That stage there must have been lowered before.
Someone must have raised it. Hmm. I don't see a way to control it from here. Apollo, what about that ladder there against the wall? We could use that to take a look up top...
What are you talking about? We have to see this sort of thing for ourselves!
Stop whining and start climbing!
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
No kidding. Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?
I can't believe such a cute little boy could do something so horrible!
What proof could possibly prove that!?
Mr. Gavin, do you know what's going on? Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?
Yet?
This is what we've been waiting for, Apollo! Let's get going!
Well, I just don't get it. I refuse to believe a cute little kid like that could do something so terrible.
Machi! Everything's going to be OK! We're here for you!
Huh?
Um, maybe Lamiroir can help?
Well, what are we going to do?
Why don't grown-ups ever just say what's on their mind instead of pretending?
Really?
He's talking about you and Ema, huh.
I want to hear about these bigger mistakes!
But that door was the only way out of the room, right?
Then I don't get it. How can they say that Machi did it?
There he goes again.
He's singing something.
Oh boy! Did you hear that? We're officially involved now!
Why are you looking at me, Apollo? Hey! I was out whooping it up in the audience!
An examination of the crime scene was enough to nail down the killer?
Ack, Apollo! They've got us on the ropes already! We'd better come up with something quick!
W-Waaait!
We have, uh, what was it called? Contradictual proof? Anyway, whatever it is, we've got it!
Of course it's true! Show 'em, Apollo!
Look, we give up now, Machi's really done for!
...There he goes again.
My heart was handcuffed to the stage, I know that!
Whoa! She's even more mysterious than I thought!
Congratulations, Apollo. You're the bad guy!
Wow, you just got badder, Apollo! Way to go!
What's she talking about, Apollo?
She looks kind of pale, huh?
That's really cool! I hope I get to travel like Lamiroir some day.
...It's hard to imagine Lamiroir lying...
...Such put-downs are hardly becoming of you, Apollo.
Great going, Apollo! You were right about Lamiroir. ...What's wrong? You don't look too happy.
...?
Yeah, Apollo, what were you thinking!?
You can't ask for a better testimony than that!
Apollo! This is a good testimony! That proves it wasn't Machi!
B-But that means Lamiroir has to be lying!
Apollo! What's he talking about!?
Then we don't have a chance of proving Machi's innocence.
Hey, that's right, Apollo! Remember when we found Machi? That was bizarre!
The judge sure seems pleased with himself!
Hey! You know I was the one who first noticed that!
It's hard to argue when she pours her heart into it like that.
They're even in my textbook at school.
Machi! He can't see... ...That's why he missed?
Um, Apollo?
That bit about Machi being tiny... ...and the gun throwing off his aim? Um, aren't you kind of, um... ...admitting that he did it?
But, Machi can't see...
Apollo! Don't you have something? Anything? You know what we need... We need something to prove the killer could see! That'll put him in his place!
Apollo! Grow a backbone!
This doesn't look so good, does it, Apollo?
...... What do we do!?
Ah ha! I get it! At least, I think I get it!
When Mr. LeTouse was shot, he tried to write something! And what would he write but the shooter's name? And what would he write it in but his own blood? Pretty good, huh?
Drat! I just wish it wasn't all rubbed out like that.
Hey Apollo, look at him. Why is Prosecutor Gavin all relaxed and smiling like that? Like he knows something we don't... and he's about to tell us.
Yeah! Apologize!
That's no way to apologize!
Apollo! Your hand's shaking!
This must be... this must be the power of science!
Wait... Prosecutor Gavin knows why, doesn't he...
A-Apollo, what does this mean for our case!?
But, what is there left to ask!?
What a lovely story!
A landscape painter who can't see... that's like a pianist who can't play, huh.
Is he right, Apollo?
Mr. LeTouse was an undercover Interpol agent... So him being Lamiroir's manager...
It's got to tie in somehow, you'd think.
Hey! No wimping out now, Apollo!
Hey, hey, Apollo!
Um, well, you know... ...Um, actually, nothing. I mean, something. ...Or maybe not.
Well, you know, the trial today? I was thinking... If you gave it a score, what score would you give it?
See? It's so... so vague!
Well, true, but we know who shot him now! Lamiroir told the whole court!
It's another mystery, Apollo! I love mysteries.
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Daddy around.
I wouldn't say that, but he has been going out a lot. Some "top secret mission", he said.
Anyway, you can't just rely on him to save the day! And you've got me to help you. We'll be fine!
That's the spirit!
Good morning, Mr. Charley! Ack! M-Mr. Charley! Your leaves!
No, no, it must be stress. He's worried about the new recruit at the office.
It was Daddy's turn to water him this week... Ack!
I'm sorry Mr. Charley, this is all my fault. I'll water you soon, promise!
...Sending my ring rolling out the door! You know how long it took me to find it?
But don't you think the props give the office a festive, fun-filled mood?
Apollo! This is the "Wright Anything Agency"! As CEO, I want an office that says we know how to have fun!
Really? I guess I've gotten used to it, after growing up with it always around the house.
I'd hide in there when we played hide 'n' seek! You just get in, slide the sections around, and you're impossible to find!
Ack! I almost forgot! Umm... I hope I become a famous Grand Magician! Oh, and I hope Apollo becomes an Ace Attorney! ...There! All done.
Well, I've been working on my "cups & balls" routine.
That's right! The very same! Here, watch... First, I put one of the cups over the ball... then I snap my fingers! Ta da! The ball's under the other cup!
...... ...Watch me pull something out of my magic panties!
Guess I know what I'll be doing tonight. Practicing! You can be my audience, Apollo!
Of course! My hat's like a little universe! Bigger on the inside than on the outside!
Incidentally, my pocket is a little universe, too! And my panties, and...
I have, too! But I noticed something strange... One time, there was a sandwich without any lettuce! Like it had disappeared... by magic!
Wait, that sandwich... You didn't...! Apollo, you shouldn't eat sample food, no matter how hungry you are!
Well, how about some tea? Here you go!
That's right, we have to get investigating! Ack, that was a close call! We almost relaxed!
Lamiroir said she's never forgotten a voice, right? That's so cool!
What's that called again? Um... Elephant ears...? I bet that's what they're called...
Wrong? Why?
That's right! I was burning up the dance floor at the time.
You bet I did! He is one of the Gavinners's guitarists after all! He's so cool! ...Oh.
But... Lamiroir heard him, didn't she? She heard Daryan backstage... Right...?
I was wondering, what is "Interpol" anyway?
Why can't they just call them "International Police" instead of making up some silly name?
Whaaaa--!? Why would anyone do that? She's not a criminal! She couldn't be!
But remember I'm a magician, Apollo! I can spot a palmed coin at fifty paces!
I wonder if it was something that has something to do with something. That something being our case. The last something, I mean.
That again? You sure like your attorney's badge. Still, I'm afraid our clients are getting tired of it...
I'm not sure about that, sorry. I was ripping up the dance floor at the time of the shooting, after all.
......
It wasn't me! I can't even make Mr. Hat laugh like that!
Hey! The other day...
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
We... didn't just imagine that, did we?
Hardly!
Ah. Ahhhhhhh! It's you!!! Uncle Valant!
No, silly! It's the Great Gramarye, Valant Gramarye! The Grand Magician!
Good to see you again, Uncle Valant! You... look exactly the same!
Let's ask him about the case, Apollo!
After all... ...Uncle Valant's one of Daddy's best friends! That's why I call him "uncle".
No, I mean... My real Daddy.
Wait, Apollo... Don't tell me you don't know about Troupe Gramarye?
You bet you've heard the name! He made a cruise ship disappear, and blew up an amusement park... ...Oh, and he made all this gold disappear from a safe! And then escaped from a high security prison!
What, Apollo?
A duo?
......
Daddy...
He was my real Daddy.
There wasn't much point in talking about it... Not now that he's gone.
No, it's OK. I'm not lonely. I've got my Daddy, after all! And you make me laugh, Apollo.
...Not that I see Daddy around much these days.
You don't know how happy I am to see you again, Uncle Valant!
Eh heh. Well, it wasn't all my doing.
That's... a video tape?
Wow... It's almost as good as it was live. So... what's the word? Mysterious...
I didn't see a stunt...
Oh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.
So that's why you were at the concert!
Hey now!
That's like, totally against the rules, Apollo!
Too bad for you, Apollo!
There's no need to rush, Uncle Valant! You should stay a while!
Well, there you go, Apollo! Let's get cracking!
Someday, I'll be as good a magician as Zak Gramarye! You'll see!
You should have seen him on stage, Apollo! He made things disappear right and left! Poof poof poof! Until he even made himself disappear! Cool, huh?
But they don't have any decisive evidence!
Right... the air vent.
Lied?
Ah! Machi!
He looks like he's doing OK!
Words are overrated! Feelings are what matter, Apollo.
If you need someone to complain to, I'll listen...
So, what did you think of the trial today?
...Whew. I'm glad he doesn't understand English after all. If he did, he would have been scared out of his mind by that trial.
No, if he's innocent, we win. Machi might not understand English, but I bet he gets that better than you do.
I'm glad Lamiroir testified! What a great person. She even got Machi off the hook by naming another suspect!
?
What is it, Apollo?
So, Machi... You can see, right?
Machi can see, and Lamiroir can't... The whole world's gone topsy-turvy!
Sorry, Apollo. I don't think we're going to get any information out of Machi. ...Which makes sense.
I think he said... "I am sorry I cannot speak your language. You are very beautiful, fair maiden."
Imagining what, Apollo?
How could he? He's a young Borginian! He doesn't speak English.
Huh? Maybe it's malfunctioning? Or it's scared, because you keep making those "I'm so mad" faces.
If you're curious about it there's only one thing to do. You should ask him.
Woo! What a great day! It's perfect weather for sleuthing!
Don't some days just feel like "magic" days or "defense" days?
Right on! Show us your stuff, Apollo!
Your voice training! This is the perfet place for it!
Aw, there's no need to be shy! Keep that up and you'll never make it on the big stage!
Then you're in luck, because it's lawyer weather today! Don't you just want to face the blue sky and shout, "Objection!"?
Look! A blimp!
Let's see... "Big Sale, All Shirts 50% Off."
Oooh! That's the police mascot, the Blue Badger!
Haven't you seen them around town? Patrolling the streets? Yes, now even law and order has a mascot!
I don't think you're showing true Blue Badger spirit, Apollo.
It's huge! And Mr. Gavin got to play on that enormous stage... I'm so jealous! Someday, I'll fight my first battle on this stage!
Well, yeah, it's a coliseum, isn't it?
Really? I had no idea! I wonder why they stopped.
Ooh! Maybe I can take it to the office when they're done with it!
Then I'll put it outside! I bet it'd be good for business!
Well, if anyone comes looking for a concert, leave it to me!
Um... Are you OK? Alone, I mean.
Speaking of "seeing", you knew who we were before we spotted you just now. And we weren't even talking.
Oh... You must have great ears!
It's all the same! He's the band mascot, too, you know.
Neither can I. I'll bet there's a story there just waiting to be told!
That's been lying there since the day before yesterday.
I kinda want to pick it up. It'd make a cool souvenir, don't you think?
I'm not complaining! Makes it easier for us to go in! And Ema gave us her OK, right? We can wander in and do as we like!
It must be hard to pretend you can see when you can't.
You know it! It just makes me think about how much further I have to go!
I don't see a volume control anywhere in the room... My guess is they give all the rooms equal treatment!
......
It's a little lackluster, you know.
I mean, using the air vent is so obvious! No audience is going to pay good money to see a trick like that.
It'd be much cooler if the killer got out through that tiny window!
I think that fits with the other stuff we know. Do you think the timing of when she dropped it is important?
I wonder if someone as little as me could even fire it?
Daddy always has stiff shoulders, maybe that could loosen him up!
Nah, he doesn't have the guts to pull the trigger, I bet.
Look! It's fruit! Fruit, Apollo! Fruit!!!
I know, I'll make it vanish! Into my stomach!
Watermelons are that expensive!?
All this tragedy, because someone left a stepladder here.
You think it was Machi?
I looked into that performance group. Turns out they're all law enforcement-related, too. Apparently, their serious portrayal of law and order is a big draw!
You're a complicated man, Mr. Apollo Justice.
A Gavinners poster.
Prosecutor Gavin looked so cool on stage! You should learn to play the guitar, too, Apollo! You can accompany my magic act!
It's a pretty old model for such a nice place.
Good speakers must cost a lot. You have any idea how much a nice one that size would cost, Apollo?
Whaaat!? But that's almost 600 dollars!
Too bad you'll never own one.
Hmm. How about "for all eternity" then?
That was the part we did the lunimol testing on in court!
You know what I couldn't stop thinking? Who's going to pay for this carpet?
I guess it's true what they say. Crime doesn't pay!
That's one heavy-duty bouquet there.
But they call lots of things heavy-duty!
What about a "heavy" scent?
What if the flowers were plastic?
OK, what if they were made out of metal?
Exactly! Though I hope all my fans don't start throwing metal flowers at me.
Is that what they're really called? "Permanent dryers"?
It just doesn't sound very glamorous, you know?
Or you could go more simple, like "permer"!
A stack of presents for Lamiroir. Stars always get the biggest presents. You know, you could give me a present, Apollo.
Gee! Thanks!!!
That thing makes normal revolvers look like water guns!
Kind of hard to see a crime when you can't see. But she did hear it!
Maybe she heard it some other way?
Doesn't seeing a bunch of machines like this make you want to just fiddle with 'em? Can I, Apollo? Please?
If you're going to make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs! That's what Daddy always says.
Me neither... I'll never be able to climb another tower again without thinking about it, you know?
I still can't believe we found Machi and Mr. LeTouse up there...
It's not like it would have been nicer if we found a dead body closer to the ground. ...Though that reminds me. Daddy's bad with heights, too.
He took me on a Ferris wheel ride a while ago, you know! Halfway through, his face got all green and he mumbled "objection" over and over.
That song... Isn't that the one Lamiroir was singing?
Wow, I'd love to do a show on a stage like this!
The house is full, and as one, the audience sighs with wonderment! There I am, singing my ballad, rose petals swirling through the air...
...Oh. That's right. I was a magician, wasn't I.
Uncle Valant!
The Lamiroir Teleportation Illusion! Ooh!
Hey Apollo, maybe Uncle Valant can shed some light on this whole thing for us!
That's one big piano! I've never actually played one.
No good, he can't play either.
Maybe now's my big chance! Stand back, this could be the debut of a prodigy! ...Eww.
Um... Let me try it again. You know, I think something's stuck in the piano! Time to take a look under the hood... ...Huh. Look! This was stuck between the strings. It looks like some kind of switch.
Throwing things inside pianos can't be good for them.
So maybe someone threw it in here after the second set...
I was wondering about the show the night of the murder. Lamiroir's vanishing act was your illusion, right?
So... you were here checking up on your trick to make sure it went well.
Wow! He just read your mind, Apollo!
Th-That's not true! I still went to all your shows! Like that one in the parking lot down at the supermarket.
I'll never forget the one I saw when I was little! How he made that whole jumbo jet go... um, what happened to the jet again?
Cool, huh? And Zak Gramarye was my daddy!
I'm rooting for you!
One skill, coming up!
Eek! It's your badge, Apollo! What's it doing in there? That was amazing! Wasn't it, Apollo?
I didn't see a stunt... Oh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.
So that's why you were at the concert!
Whoa! You can't just ask that sort of thing, Apollo!
It's against the rules to ask a magician how they did it.
...Well, you might have a point, there. Will you tell us, Uncle Valant?
But I don't know!
True. You're getting on in years. Not much time left to make your mark, huh...
This switch, sitting here, tempting me to push it...
Apollo, please... To think that every strange switch triggers a bomb... That kind of old-fashioned crime drama thinking doesn't cut it in our busy times!
Hmm... Maybe it turns on the electric razor in Prosecutor Gavin's dressing room?
So... it really was Daryan's voice that she heard.
It must have been tough for Machi... ...Pretending he couldn't see, and all the while acting as your eyes.
I guess that's what it means to be undercover.
B-But I don't think you...
No way! That seems really unlikely to me. I mean, you're such a sweet person, Lamiroir!
That reminds me... That was an incredible illusion you pulled off!
When you teleported from one stage to the other? Remember?
Hard to be a magician if you can't keep a secret, you know?
That's been lying there since the day before yesterday!
So, can I put it on?
"Attached"? I'm not some kind of robot, Apollo!
10-4 that, little buddy, this is Trucy reporting in, over. ......
No one answered.
What good is a receiver that doesn't receive? That's like Ema not performing forensic investigations!
But that blood stain helped uncover the biggest mystery of all!
We wouldn't have found that out without you!
...I was hoping we could check out the crime scene again.
Something strange?
......
That's the part we did the lunimol testing on in court!
...! Ema's kind of scary when it comes to science.
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?
I mean, think about it. Now you don't have to be embarrassed about anything else all year!
But that's not how it sounded in Lamiroir's testimony.
That's right!
I found the link, you know! First, Prosecutor Gavin's heart-shaped key ring was stolen. Then Lamiroir flew through the air. Then Prosecutor Gavin's guitar caught on fire. And in the end, a bullet took Mr. LeTouse's life... And he went up into the sky with a guitar... Well, thirty feet up, at least.
I know! And I found it.
What... You all think I did it!?
...So what did you find?
...What is it?
Ooh, like on a beetle?
An electronic signal, you say? Hmm...
There's enough sparks flying around here just with you two talking.
A transmitter, huh...
Maybe they were trying to throw off the investigation?
A transmitter?
A transmitter?
What is it, Apollo?
I-I-It's on fire! Ema's device is on fire!
This part here must work like a lighter!
Hey, Apollo! Let's ask Ema more about this switch!
Now that she has some first-hand experience.
Good luck!
Too bad, I was hoping it was for a bomb that would blow up the whole coliseum.
And then she'll do all sorts of scientific tests! Like splitting your hairdo into three separate spikes. While she stands by, laughing and laughing in her high-pitched voice.
...... Did you just hear someone laughing?
Good thing machines run even if we don't know how many work! ...That's what Daddy always says.
Daryan...
Daryan isn't in the best of moods, is he?
It is a crime scene. Not exactly the happiest place to hang out.
So, about your alibi...
Your guitar playing was something else!
They won't let you work?
Mr. Gavin? A stick in the mud?
Well, I think the Gavinners are the best! I have all your albums.
You don't think he based it on a real experience, do you?
Ooh! You mean the songs just kind of "come to him"?
Apollo! Let's go check it out! I've always wanted to see the prosecutor's office.
Right on!
Let's... not talk to him anymore. Alright?
I wonder where Lamiroir went off to?
I guess... But I can't help worry about her a little.
So... this is it. The Gavinners's head office.
Oh well, guess we'll have to come back. Or we can hide behind that bookshelf real quiet-like...
Why? We'd just be waiting. Quietly. So he didn't notice. What if we heard something scandalous about the band!?
Tee hee! Just thought we'd drop in. Hope you're not mad...?
Watch and learn, Apollo!
Huh?
What do you think he means, Apollo?
That's the guitar from the concert, isn't it...
Oh? Did you find anything out?
Sounds like something we should ask about.
What's that on the plate there?
Gum...?
You'd think a rock star could afford a fresh stick.
Wait, that phone call...
Who? Us? I-I tried to stop him, really! But he forced me to!
This... lump?
They're backup guitars, Apollo. Don't you know anything? Rock 'n' rollers always smash their guitars at the end of a show!
You know what, you should try rocking a little, Apollo.
No, no! Not at all! I mean, you're Mr. Gavin, upstanding prosecutor!
Wow, look at that stereo!
That's such a huge speaker! It must be really loud!
Really? At my place I can hear when the neighbors turn their VCR on to record something.
And lately, we've been getting complaints about Apollo's voice training.
Look, Apollo! He's got three televisions!
I wish I had three TVs.
I may look laid back and relaxed, but in reality, I'm quite busy, you know! I'm living life at turbo speed! Doing magic, going to school, investigating cases... But... But if I had three big TVs...! I could watch a magic video, do my homework, and catch a crime drama all at once!
What's wrong, Apollo? You look confused.
I love the ones with the vibrating rollers on your back! Those feel great!
Did I say something wrong?
Yes! I always read the TV section.
Ooh, is that a new show? I haven't heard about that one.
Oh, does this have anything to do with the case...?
Oh, that was all Apollo's idea!
Probably no one in Borginia could believe it.
Yeah, we ran into him moping in front of the coliseum.
I really love that song. It has such a great atmosphere to it.
And that's when you heard Lamiroir's voice?
Wow, prosecutors really have a lot of clout.
And music history was made! Probably not an experience your average lawyer would ever have. Like Apollo, say.
Don't call it a lump! That's a piece of history! And it's only browned, not really "charred".
Do you think you could show it to us? Your charred... I mean slightly burnt guitar?
How did it end up here?
So this guitar is from Borginia?
See, prosecutors do have a lot of clout.
Such a valuable guitar... It's too bad it got burned.
That's right! What was that all about?
A broken... device?
Hmm...
Well? Well? What is it?
Oh? If you don't want to tell us, you could just say so.
Oh?
It's a lovely song! I got all teary-eyed!
Whoa! Th-That's so special!
I thought it'd be cool! I could pretend I was concert security and stuff.
Tee hee! You think?
What is it, Apollo?
A-Another one!?
It's burned clean through!
...It's kind of like you after a trial, Apollo!
Maybe it's to keep people from eating it by mistake.
Maybe it's the manufacturer? "Sample Toys: When you can't afford the real thing!"
Hey, that's right...
Um... Mr. Prosecutor?
Can I ask you why you sing in a band?
Mr. Gavin got it as a present from Lamiroir!
Kinda sad how it ended up.
......
Oh, I'm sorry. It's nothing, really. I was just wondering, wouldn't it be cool if that replica just happened to vanish?
Though a simple disappearance would kind of lack punch. What if it hatched into a dove? Or a person, dressed like a dove...
They've even got little locks on them!
Apollo! You don't want me to...? ...Well, I do kinda like that cherry red one!
Oh. That's too bad.
He left his TV on. Think we should turn it off for him?
OK, if you say so. It's kind of a waste of electricity.
Tee hee! How'd you know? It's just, I've never seen a TV this big before!
What!? You mean no soap operas!? No Saturday morning cartoons!?
I... I had no idea.
What a cool chair! I'm going to sit in it now while no one's looking! Wow! So this is what it feels like to be a star!
I can imagine sitting here, strumming my guitar... "Oh, it's you, Herr Forehead. Sorry... I'm busy. Woooo."
Tee hee! Maybe I'll make that part of my Wonder Bar repertoire!
Wow! The people look like little rice grains! Hey! That one with the blonde hair! Do you think that's Mr. Gavin?
But look at the one next to him with the big black poof of hair pointing straight ahead!
Looks like Machi is in questioning.
I guess we'll just have to come back later if we want to see him.
What's strange?
Huh? The stage is pitch dark!
I'll go get someone! Yipes, it was really dark out there.
...Hey, Apollo.
...Doesn't something about the stage seem different to you? Like, something's changed?
I can't put my finger on it, but it's bugging me.
Hey, that case... Wasn't that open before?
Wait... Look! Where the case closes...
Let's open it, Apollo! Eeeeeeeek! Lamiroir! Lamiroooooooir!
Ema! How's Lamiroir? Is she OK?
So... she's OK?
Th-That's good to hear...
But they hit her on the forehead, right? That's right in front of her! How could she not see... Oh.
You know, in his secret identity! As an undercover agent!
Why would he be carrying this around? Was it some kind of souvenir?
...I'm not sure the case is to blame here, Apollo. We have to find whoever did this to her. No one hits a siren of the ballad on my watch and gets away with it!
Ack!
Ah...
And you're much taller than I am. You're about as tall as Apollo.
But why would anyone attack you, Lamiroir!?
It's a cocoon... so, do you get silk from it?
T-T-T-To death!?
But this is just a piece of plastic!
So, that's what he was up to?
Smuggling...
"Marked"...?
Ah! So you could have brought those Borginian Cocoons with you...
Is that why they suspected you?
What, Apollo?
Huh? Like what? How could such a tiny ball of thread cause such a commotion?
Huh?
Apollo...?
Huh? Where are we going?
I was completely fooled, myself.
Hey, you got a reaction! A big one!
M-Machi...?
Have him tell us about it!
Well, let's hear him out before he gets grumpy, Apollo!
What is this cocoon, anyway?
A cure...?
But, if it's a cure, why keep it in Borginia like that? Just think of all the lives they could save by sharing the medicine!
He couldn't be a smuggler! He's so little!
Well, that's true. I am sort of a magician.
Well, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?
First he plays blind, now he plays dumb...
Can't go home!?
...Daryan?
Daryan! Wait!
Darn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...
Apollo!
Why is everyone ignoring me!?
Well, this is it!
Daryan! Wait!
Darn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...
Eeek!
Who's that talking...?
You... aren't the witness today, are you, Uncle Valant?
Ooh, with vanishing magic!?
Warning...? What?
And there he goes.
Oh, big illusions are the bread and butter of a magician! You can't pull off a show without one! The big illusion is always a spectacle to remember! Usually, it involves cutting up things, like people or elephants... ...or the Eiffel Tower. Anything, really!
Lamiroir's disappearing act.
I wonder what he meant by it being at "the root of all that has happened"?
Oh, that's right... Remember yesterday morning? The judge said he had to go visit him after the trial.
I'll let you read that article for us, Apollo! Just leave the TV guide page to me!
"Incuritis", was it? That article said there is no known cure!
And Apollo. You heard them too, right?
Uh oh, Apollo! If he declares a verdict now...
...Daryan?
Apollo! Aren't you going to ask him what he was about to tell us yesterday?
Yahoo! Victory, Apollo! We did it!
When Prosecutor Gavin's tough, he's really tough!
What are you going to do, Apollo!?
Yay! I knew he was innocent!
What's wrong, Apollo? You got a tummy ache or something?
Voice? Or voices? Was it you and Ema, Apollo?
He's clammed up, Apollo!
What is this cocoon, anyway?
A cure...?
Well, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?
Maybe... it was a trap, and he walked right into it?
So... you were at the scene of the crime when you heard those shots?
Huh? What do you know?
Hey, he's right! Look, Apollo!
Wait, I bet his father was the architect that designed the hall or something!
D-Don't look at me!
Well, at least we're clear on one thing: Machi didn't shoot Mr. LeTouse!
Apollo! You're his defense! You're supposed to believe whatever he says. Even lies! That's what Daddy always told me!
You're sure you won't testify, Machi?
Hmm, well it was worth a shot.
Can't go home!?
That's the spirit, Apollo! So, what's your plan?
Someone... else?
Right!
......
Apollo... You know, for a moment there... ...You were pretty cool.
Apollo! If we keep asking the same questions as yesterday we won't get anywhere!
Don't get too calm, or you might grind to a halt.
I liked you better before with the "do I have to repeat myself" bit.
"Maybe", Apollo?
Apollo! The murder weapon, the revolver was Mr. LeTouse's, right?
Well, maybe when he said, "Press the switch"... ...he really meant to say, "Pull the trigger!"
Because his English isn't so good!
Oh. Oh, right! Sorry, I kind of forgot who was what.
Lamiroir seems awfully quiet all of a sudden.
Maybe there's some detail we're missing?
Right!
Lamiroir said it was about thirty feet, right?
Hey... he's got a point! How do we know where it was when she heard the voice? ...When the shooter said "press the switch"?
What's up, Apollo? Apollo...?
Y...Yeah?
Ah...!
That's right... He got it in Borginia from Lamiroir! He said the sound was amazing. Before it burned, of course. Now it just kind of smokes.
Ack! That's right! Of course! The guitar caught fire during Lamiroir's song!
Hey, he's right! Look! The "bullet" is supposed to come after the "fire"!
Huh?
W-What if she couldn't hear it, Apollo?
Th-There is!?
Apollo! Think it through again!
Wh-What are you going to do, Apollo!?
She's not talking, Apollo. What do we do?
But how are you going to do that!? She was singing on the stage, Apollo! She couldn't have been up above the ceiling, too!
!
You mean Uncle Valant!?
Apollo!
It's not nice to reveal a magician's secrets! And it's against the rules!
Magicians only reveal details of their acts on a need-to-know basis. They're the bread and butter of a magician's life, you know.
Good luck, Apollo!
I figured it out already! I am a magician, after all.
Not a chance! I can't reveal another magician's secrets! C'mon!
Hey, that's not a bad guess! Wrong, but not bad!
See? Like I said, it's on a need-to-know basis.
That's Uncle Valant for you! The old Gramarye touch!
If you want my professional opinion, I'll bet the answer's right there in that video.
Sorry. I don't work in evidence.
Really? I'm sure Daddy would have loved working on this.
I'm a little confused, too, there, Apollo.
Better luck next time, Polly-wog!
C'mon, Apollo! That's an easy one. They were just playing a recording!
Oh? You mean, I'm wrong?
No use trying to avoid the problem at hand, Apollo.
Sorry, Apollo. I'm not telling. Not even if you make those puppy dog faces.
That's right! Wouldn't the shooter and victim have heard? She was singing right over their heads, after all!
Ack... I know what he means! That old speaker, Apollo!
Monitoring?
That machine, Apollo! The one that breaks music into tracks!
Apollo! I can't believe it! It really happened during the second act? A-And right in the middle of Lamiroir's performance!?
Ah... Daddy!
Where have you been lately, Daddy? You haven't been coming to the office at all!
Secret? You mean like, you're undercover?
Oh no! What if you're shot, too, Daddy!?
But what about all the proof? The brooch... and the switch!
But...!
What are those, Daddy? They don't look like very good snacking material.
Gunpowder...!?
Hey, Apollo! That's where we found that little device thingy!
Yeah, or one of those noisemakers, like you shoot off on New Years!
Really!? I had no idea! Well did you know this? It takes more than 500 peanuts to make one 12-ounce jar of peanut butter!
Uhh... What does he want us to do? No "conventional methods"? What does that mean?
I guess...
Apollo! Glare back at him!
Apollo! Chin up! Back straight! You're wilting!
Machi heard them, too! Remember he said he ran for the air duct when he heard them?
That's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?
You'd better know, Apollo! Otherwise we're through...
That's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?
We need proof, Apollo! We need to prove that the shooting took place during the second set!
Maybe the gunshots are the key after all!
Well, Lamiroir said she heard them, right? Right in the middle of her illusion, when she was up above the ceiling.
If you can prove the gun was shot right when she missed those lyrics... ...we're home free, I'd think.
Let's take a look through our evidence! Maybe there's something in there...
He's pretty eager to paint Lamiroir as a liar, isn't he?
Hmm... This is tough. So, what do we do?
Yeah, that's what I've been wondering!
Who's on trial here again?
How did it end up here?
So this guitar is from Borginia?
A broken... device?
You... You mean...
......
First you were "Sleeves", then "kid", now "punk". You're losing rank fast, Apollo!
Lamiroir...
A-Apollo!? Were you wrong?
Apollo! If Machi's not the accomplice... ...then our whole case is ruined!
Well, you'd better find a way to prove it!
Ack... There has to be something that doesn't fit! ...Something odd.
Wh-What? You thought of something!?
Yeah? You got something?
Oh, Daddy? He couldn't play a part like that even if he had three hands!
Apollo! Remember what Daddy said?
I wonder what he meant by every man's "igniter"?
Go for it, Apollo!
Um, Daryan's laughing again...
Ah...
Uh oh, he's laughing again.
I wonder what'll happen to Machi...
Daddy...!
Courage...?
You mean, you'll be able to see again?
That's right! She's the "landscape painter in sound", after all!
Woo hoo! I can't wait, Lamiroir!
You bet! Me, too!
...Have them catch the killer at the end!

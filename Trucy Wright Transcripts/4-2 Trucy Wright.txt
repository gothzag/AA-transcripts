Welcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've "always come to the Wright place!" I'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician.
Here, check out our flyer! So... what's your name?
Ack! Don't touch Mr. Charley!
He's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr. Charley. He's lived here since Daddy was a rookie attorney!
Now I take care of him!
Really? I had no idea these were that popular!
Eh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me!
That's right! This cabinet is used for an illusion called the "Zig-Zag"!
Oh, it's a little big for me, you see. So I'm using it as furniture. Hats in the top, shirts in the middle, and pants down below! I think it's a nice touch... don't you?
That's my favorite magician! I want to be just like him someday!
How rude!
Those are my magic props! Practice, practice, practice! A professional never leaves their weapons far from reach!
Oh, no one plays here anyway. And the neighbors complain.
Oh, that's just for show. Don't wear it, please!
I put it there so clients can see it and know who I am. Nothing says "magician" like a silk top hat!
That right there is the whole reason I became a magician!
I saw a plate just like that in a restaurant once. The floating fork looked so real! That's when I knew... Someday, I'd make magic more amazing than that spaghetti!
You've never seen one of these? It's a magic table!
So you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling!
You bet! Daddy started it seven years ago, when he quit law. Of course, we only have two people signed up right now.
Trucy Wright, Magician Extraordinaire! I've done a lot of stage shows! Paid, too! I am a professional, you know.
Promise you'll come to one of my shows, OK? Let's see... Oh, and the other person our agency represents is... Phoenix Wright, Pianist Extra Ordinaire!
Our agency doesn't see that as a problem. Why, there are many magicians who can't do magic!
That's right! After Daddy quit law seven years ago... ...I promised I would keep him fed! So I'm kind of his sugar daddy! Get it?
I'm in charge of this whole office, too. Pretty amazing for a young lass of fifteen, wouldn't you agree!?
Daddy? Oh... he's 33 this year.
?
Eh? You know about that!?
So I hear. I was too young to understand what was going on. I'll ask Daddy about it next time I get a chance.
Daddy's not here right now. He's in the hospital.
Yeah. He's on strict bed rest until he gets better.
Oh, I've seen one of those before! That's an attorney's badge. It looks just like the one Daddy used to have. Now if I take this badge... And do this, and this... See! It's gone!
No need to worry! Just look in your pocket!
And here's your badge. You can have it back now.
Oh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Good morning, Doctor!
Is... this Daddy's room?
Aaaah! Daddy! You snuck some grape juice in again!? The doctor said you weren't supposed to drink that here!
... Oh. "Deep Sea Mineral Water". That's fine, I guess.
Look how messy this is! You're just hopeless without me, aren't you, Daddy?
Oh, I know that one! That's the Sniffling Samurai! His "Booger Flick" attack is a big hit with the grade school crowd.
Daddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore!
Tee hee! Aw, Daddy!
Huh? But didn't you come into the office of your own free will anyway?
That's right, Daddy! How are we going to pay this month's rent!? And the groceries!?
No! I can't! I only just made friends... How could you do this to me... to us!? Polly!
You got him, Daddy! Hook, line, and sinker!
Oh, Daddy. Sorry, Apollo. He just loves jokes, you know. Even the ones that aren't very funny.
Ah! Good morning!
All's well that ends well, I guess...
You know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly?
This is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon?
That's a pretty old noodle!
So, it was like destiny that you became what you are.
Daddy's a regular at his noodle stand.
What do you mean?
It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints!
Your father...?
That's the saddest thing I've heard all day.
Um, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo.
I lost something last night. That is, something was stolen.
Well, um... Someone stole a pair of my panties.
My panties, yes.
I was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. "Give those back!" I shouted. "Wait!"
...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do...
Well, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map!
Things have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases!
Let's see where we stand!
Phoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him!
And the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand.
And the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties!
Let's go, Polly! To the streets!
How could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me!
Apollo!
Your [sic] going to have to press me for information! Go ahead, do your worst!
You can't "pass"! This is your job! Look, I had hung them outside the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. "Give those back!" I shouted. "Wait!" ...But I lost him. I can't live without those panties! Please find them!
Hmm... One moment... ... Allakazam! Allakazing!
...
That's it! Pretty neat, huh?
What's that, Polly? Oh, I know! You want to see a magic trick! Well, you've come to the right girl! Watch as I make that evidence disappear, forever!
Maybe he's gone for an examination?
I think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations!
Why don't we come back later?
According to the map, this is the place!
Apollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her!
Excuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you?
That's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money...
Apollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something!
Yay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am!
Wow, what a big house! And the gate is so big...
I like the fox! It's so cute!
Your family "crest"?
So it's like a motto! You need a crest, too, Apollo! Ooh! How about the scales of justice? Or a lunar lander!
Was this paint knocked over by the car that hit my Daddy?
Of course! Then you can make them clean up their own mess!
Ooh! I wish I could say cool things like that!
Little Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so...
What is it, Apollo?
Huh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure.
Gangst... Oh! That means you're the bad guys!
So, you're saying that business is in a slump?
That's my daddy!
Capo? Point man...?
So you came to his rescue?
But, why are you out here cleaning it up?
I mean, aren't you a gangster? Don't you have any "goons" to do your dirty work for you?
She's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know?
I smell an incident!
I wonder why it's named that? Hey! There's something written on the gate post...
You mean the Kitaki Family built this park? It's so nice of them to give to the community like that!
You know what I think? I bet they're filming a movie. Let's go take a look! Maybe we'll see someone famous!
...He got mad at me.
Why's she wearing a lab coat?
...Come again? What's Hydroxy... stuff?
Why don't we ask that nice woman across the street?
A detective's life sure is a hard one!
Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them.
Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...?
Wait, you don't think...
Wow, and he took off its mirror? I never knew Daddy was so strong. I only have room in my pocket for one of these, though. Which do you want to take?
I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know.
I'm on it!
I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know.
Right-o!
Chicago... huh?
Did something happen at your house, too?
Somehow I don't think "no" is an acceptable answer, Polly.
Whaaaaaaat? So it wasn't just my panties that were stolen!?
I know! We'll find your bloomers, too!
I wonder what that is...? It doesn't look like paint...
The bottom is covered with paint!
It looks like a leaf was stuck to the bottom when the wearer stepped in some yellow paint.
...... Apollo! I saw you try to wipe your hand on my cape!
It's cut clean off! I wonder what's in there...?
Let's see... Zzzzzzaaaaap! Eeek!
Hee hee! Just a little joke!
You mean, don't "shock" you? Zzzzzzaaaaap! Hee hee!
Uh, um, Miss! Miss!
Here, our flyer.
Yeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice!
Drop by our office! We'll be waiting!
I dunno. She seemed like she could use some help.
...I wouldn't be so sure!
This would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly.
...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there.
Hmm... Oh! That's where the thief went!
The one who snatcked my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties!
Well, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate!
That doorway sure is sparkly!
Funny, it looks closed. Maybe they're on vacation today?
"Three shots for the price of one!" Ooh, now's our chance, Apollo!
Maybe they're tax evaders!
Did something happen?
We could ask Mr. Eldoon. He is their neighbor and all. And we should check out that garage! What if the thief who stole my panties is still in there!?
You see? What? Did you figure out why it was stolen!?
Wow! It does smell like noodles!
This house is... well, it's old!
Prior planning prevents poor performance!
Collecting rainwater to do the dishes! How environmentally conscious!
Oh I'm sure he finds the best water money can buy! Taste is his business, you know. Look, that sign over there! "Eldoon's only uses water from all-natural sources!"
"Save the light!" indeed! Mr. Eldoon's house is practically in the dark here!
Look! A doggy! Good boy, good boy, Salty!
Spoon doesn't seem so lively.
Apollo! Let's find that stand soon! For Spoon's sake!
No one steals a legend and gets away with it on my watch! Let's find that legend, Apollo!
They took everything?
At least they left one bowl. Look, there, on the ground.
That's it! That's where the thief who snatched my panties ran to!
Let's make sure to check out that garage thoroughly!
Hey, do you think something happened next door? There's a police car out front...
Hmm...
The mascot of Eldoon's Noodles!
Very high-concept.
Yes sir!
It's the Eldoon's Noodle's mascot! Mr. Salty! He's so cute!
You know... Come to think of it... ...It looks a lot like you, Apollo. Especially the red parts.
Ooh, look! I love these little personal touches!
He must have painted it on by hand with warm, professional care!
This is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran!
Maybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties!
Let's take a closer look!
Somoene dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure!
We should bring it to him later!
Hey! Look at that!
What!? You're smiling like you know something I don't... You aren't keeping a clue from me, are you, Polly?
No? Then what were you smiling about?
Well, don't make faces that ah... AH-CHOO! ...are so misleading then.
Mmm. Well, I'm sure there's gotta be a clue somewhere! Let's keep checking things out!
... That's your clue? Sorry, but that leaves me feeling kind of... clueless.
There's no need to bluff here, Apollo! Save that for the court!
Whoa! It's the same color and size and everything! A perfect match!
Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...?
So the car that hit Daddy last night...
Wow. You put the "pro" in "professional", Apollo!
...?
Wow!
Everyone's gotta have a hobby, I guess.
What!?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!!
Wow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing!
No, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties!
My little panties, of course! They've come home to mama! I can't wait to use them!
Watch closely now... See? Nothing in the panties... ...Ta-da!!!
My panties are an extra-dimensional space... Anything can fit in there! ...They're my Magic Panties! It's one of my best tricks.
They love them over at the Wonder Bar. I do shows there nightly.
What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade!
So the car that hit Daddy last night...
Wow. You put the "pro" in "professional", Apollo!
I know, it was amazing how you slyly peeked up there! I think you have a successful career in peeking up tailpipes ahead of you!
You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though.
Hey! A kitty-cat! Here, kitty kitty kitty.
...It's not coming down.
It's OK kitty-cat! His hair won't hurt you!
Polly! That's called a "stepladder"! C'mon!
It's a much more complex piece of machinery. It's like two ladders stuck together!
Wait... Huh?
Er... Can we talk about something else?
Eeeeeeek! Someone's there! ... Oh, it's just a gold-painted human skeleton.
There's a mannequin hand waving to us from the box behind the skeleton. This place just screams "hospital storage", don't you think?
Look at this cute little watch-strap! I want one!
What is?
Hey, you're right! Sharp, Apollo!
So, what does that tell you?
They did drop their phone, after all. I kinda figured they were a little spacey already.
Something the matter?
Of course not!
Oh? Do you want to know the secret of my panties?
Apollo!
Now that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him.
What, you want to see them again? Well, if you must...
What are you talking about!? The case isn't closed until we have our thief! Just find him on the side while you work on the other cases!
If we don't need the police... then we don't need defense attorneys, either, right?
I'm so glad we found my panties!
And in time for tonight's show, too! A lot of people come just to see my panties, you know!
?
...? You aren't going to search through the trash?
Oh, no, please, knock yourself out. Don't mind me, I'll be waiting over here.
I remember, Apollo! It was the Merakits Clinic!
Why? I'm right, aren't I?
Daddy! How do you feel?
The elderly need their rest!
Look! My panties! They came home to mama!
Little Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh.
She's a neat freak! How cute!
...?
Look at the name plate! "Kitaki"...! That's so cool! Short and blunt, like any good gangster! Ooh! Let's change our name! How about... "W. A. A."! ... Maybe that's too short and blunt. What do you think?
Polly's amazing! He found my panties so quick! Almost like he was the one who stole them!
Maybe something happened?
It looked like something had happened in that park.
Right! Let's ignore that and find that noodle stand!
My panties!
Right! Back to the office to plan our next move!
I knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please...
Maybe you can tell us what happened? Were you hit by a car? Did someone steal your stand? Or your panties?
Murder...
Not yet?
I think you're on to something! "Ms. Kitaki"... I like the sound of that!
There were a lot of police cars there.
Um... what sort of person is your fiancé?
Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency!
Right! Let's go check out the scene of the crime!
If we take this we'll be able to investigate the scene!
Why does this envelope say "Hit Request"?
Ooh, you mean gangster-talk!? So does "hit" mean "to defend" in gangster-ese? Well, "hit man"?
Maybe he's getting an examination again?
Too bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you!
Oh? That's a surprise.
Polly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell.
Drat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then.
We're not playing! We're um, "investigating"! Aren't we, Apollo?
... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request!
Oooh! R-Really!?
Whee!
Thank you! Will we see you again...?
Eeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse!
Wow. It sure got me.
Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...
She doesn't seem that happy about it.
Apollo! Look! That stand! ... It says "Eldoon"!
Hey, Apollo. My very un-scientific analysis tells me something here is very suspicious...
We're not making much progress here.
Busy eating snacks, I'd say.
Oh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello?
And we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!?
Aw, what a bummer.
Oh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something?
Guess what! We found Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand at the scene of the crime!
That funny detective lady won't let us on the scene! What kind of detective wears a lab coat, anyway!?
That's my daddy! He knows all the police types. Oh, wait! Maybe you know that other guy, too!
That shining prince on the motorcycle!
Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!
Yeah. That detective woman won't let us!
Hmm... I think we should focus on finding more information about the case.
Of course! This is my first criminal investigation! And it's so mysterious! A noodle stand pushing a dead man along...
I knew it! More information, that's what we need!
Whoa!
I... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me.
Let's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is!
Can you read it?
That's too bad. I guess we're stuck with this mysterious bottle of white powder...
Detective Skye! How do you know my daddy?
Trucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter.
You seem shocked.
Ahh, a little urban oasis. I bet children come here to splash around in the water.
Well, they could listen to the water and pretend they were playing.
Apollo! I bet the victim was going to have a picnic here!
Ooh... lingo!
Those black spots?
B-Blow?
Wow! Amazing! It's like magic!
Apollo, she's... sparkling.
Chin up, Polly!
With the defendant's fingerprints on it... Which means... You think he stuck it into the victim?
Do you think the victim was the noodle stand thief?
Yeah! Taking care of business, Little Plum Kitaki style!
It does say "Eldoon" in big letters, doesn't it!
It's going to be a little weird telling him... what with the corpse and all...
That's right! Congratulations, Apollo!
You and your trash cans! Go ahead, knock yourself out.
Wow, Apollo! You're a genius at finding panties!
Th-They're not mine!
I'll always remember this trash can as "the place where Apollo found those bloomers"!
Th-They're not mine!
A pistol?
Not so mysterious, actually... We should tell her, Apollo! After all, we know where the stand came from!
He's famous in this part of town.
What sort of person was the victim, anyway?
Ooh! Were you studying abroad?
Why didn't you just become a forensics expert in Europe?
Really? I had no idea...
I see.
Whaaaaaaaa--!?
Hmm... Maybe that's why the cop car was parked there?
She's right, Polly! Let's make a difference! ...Is something wrong?
Which means that, at the very least, he was here at the scene of the crime...?
Pulling a noodle stand... Very strange.
How do we know for sure? What if this is really a jar for something else, like jam, or honey?
Well, so the police don't find out, that's why!
Oh, huh, I guess. That's boring.
These bloomers sure have a... distinct design!
That way, she doesn't have to write her name on them! Genius!
So, the defendant's prints are on this knife...
That's what I call irrefutable scientific evidence! Neat!
Huh? Look at this, Apollo! Mr. Eldoon spelled his name backwards on this side!
Huh... Oh, I get it! So the name of his store is the same whether you read it forward or backwards!
...... Then, how about a store called "Team Meat"?
Why, a store that sells meat! "It's not meat, useless it's Team Meat!"
The father? You mean like a priest?
.........
But we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least.
Oh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out.
He said his old foot injury was acting up.
Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine "as long as you're there, Trucy".
Oooh! Do some now! I want to see! ...Er, hear!
...... That sounds more like a self-mantra than voice training.
Sounds like they've both been voice training too, Apollo.
Ah! It's him! The pri--guy from yesterday! He's a prosecutor?
I swear I could see the guitar for a second!
They always say that, on stage, you should hit the crowd with speed and ferocity! Sounds like he got you good, huh, Polly?
You got to hand it to him, Wocky sure has guts!
I can catch bullets between my teeth! But I never learned how to catch them with my heart!
Well, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information!
Chin up, Apollo! Back straight!
...Wocky sure is quiet all of a sudden.
Don't worry! I can handle myself around guns. Magic guns, at least. The ones that pigeons come out of.
...
That man... I can't help but feel I've seen him somewhere before.
And I've got a show to perform.
He sure is confident...
I think he means he couldn't see it that clearly.
Judging from his smug expression... ...I'd say Prosecutor Gavin had that answer ready before you even spotted the problem.
We always make the biggest mistakes when we're our most confident! He's got a weak point somewhere, Apollo! Find it!
Apollo! Pace yourself! This trial's not over yet!
M-Me? Well... I'd probably scream, "Eeeeeek!"
Well, maybe the criminal wouldn't have fired if he hadn't shouted like that.
He actually looks like he had no idea he was in danger.
I'm totally sure that the killer fired because Mr. Stickler startled him.
Doesn't something about that strike you as odd, Apollo?
The killer was in a hurry, right? He fired the pistol, and tossed it right away...
In that case, I'd expect to find something that we didn't find!
That's right! He didn't have time to wipe the gun for prints!
I'm not little!
Eh...?
... Gotta admit, I didn't think of that, Apollo.
I liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go.
At least the testimony's getting a little clearer.
What gives, Apollo!? Let's see that voice training go to work!
What do you mean, "nothing to say"!? Isn't it obvious from what the witness just said?
When he re-stated what he saw just now, he said he saw Wocky drop a "murderous weapon". But that's not the same as being 100% sure of what Wocky threw away!
He's just confused because a pistol was found at the scene! Poor Mr. Stickler... It must be hard to be so perfect, and yet so wrong.
Well, if what he threw wasn't a pistol...
...
...
...
...
...
...Come to the defendant lobby, Apollo!!!...
D-Don't cry, Apollo!
Wait! Just calm down, Apollo! Or else...
Surprised? This is one of my best tricks! The Amazing Mr. Hat!
He's a big hit on stage at the Wonder Bar!
Well, what do you think? Do ya like it!?
Apollo! Now is not the time to be threatening me! It's you who's being threatened here!
Remember what you said to Wocky's father yesterday? You promised you'd save his son!
Look, once the judge declares a verdict, it's all over. If I can use my talent to stop that from happening, I will!
I'm not talking about magic, Apollo! I know when the witness isn't confident... I can perceive what he's feeling! It might not mean anything, but it's all we've got...
Think back, Apollo. Think back to the times when there was a contradiction in his testimony! All the times!
Good thing I do!
There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in. And each time, there was a contradiction.
He said the man tossed aside a pistol... But it turned out he wasn't sure, and sure enough, there was a contradiction.
Didn't you notice anything? Whenever he made a statement he wasn't confident in... ...he displayed a certain habit!
Did you see it? The very moment he said the word "pistol"... ...his fingers got all tense, and he fiddled with the corner of a page in his book!
Well, I could see it. How else do you think Daddy went seven years without losing a game of poker?
I always sat next to Daddy during big matches. I could see what his opponents were feeling!
It's not cheating, officially. I wasn't looking at their hands or anything. And I wasn't there all the time, either. Daddy's quite good at poker, after all. But not good enough to go undefeated that long!
You have to listen to his testimony one more time! No... scratch that! You have to watch his testimony! Perceive the truth!
Not true!
Daddy said so. He said you have the power, Apollo.
Time's up! Sorry I can't think of any other way out of this one, Apollo.
He said his old foot injury was acting up. Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine "as long as you're there, Trucy".
Apollo...
...I knew you could do it all along! Oh, one more thing.
Try to cover for Mr. Hat as best you can!
Oh, you mean me?
...I think he's on to me.
Don't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book!
Focus, Apollo! Find his weak spot!
I think Daddy was right! You can see it, can't you, Apollo? You're almost there! Find the weak spot in his testimony!
Don't forget, Apollo. You have to focus to perceive the truth!
Wait, Apollo! This has to be it!
Don't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book!
...Know what?
Your... bracelet?
Apollo?
This is what I meant by "focusing".
In this state, you can see everything, Apollo! Everything the witness does!
Just look for Mr. Stickler's twitch -- his habit. You remember it, right?
You got it! Right now, you're looking at the witness's face. ...And your eyes are sort of bugging out.
First, move your focus of attention down to Mr. Stickler's hand.
You know what to look for now, but you have to be looking at the right place.
Perfect! Now you're really ready!
Ready to perceive the truth behind the twitch!
Try listening to the witness talk as you focus. Then watch for his habit.
That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive! Find his weak spot and I guarantee we'll be able to give him the Royal Flush!
I'm a magician, thank you very much.
Don't worry if you miss it, you can always try again!
A-Apollo! That's not it!
Remember his habit: He fiddles with the pages of his book! The word he's saying right when you see his fingers twitch is the key!
And don't worry about getting it perfect your first time. You can always try again!
Sure do!
You want me to call Mr. Stickler's phone?
H-Hey! My pocket's ringing! Wait! This is the phone from yesterday!
Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure!
That's the phone from yesterday!
Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure!
...Who would have guessed the judge was up on his cell phone industry trends?
Now's your chance, Apollo! Connect Mr. Stickler to the crime!
Apollo! Remember where we found that cell phone! If it had fallen on the ground before that night...
...
His nervous habit must not be acting up... I didn't sense anything either, actually. Looks like you're on your own this time around!
Do you think sampling free food counts as a religion?
That was a pretty suspicious pause there.
Why are you smiling like that, Apollo?
What's a "make-up test", Apollo?
His habit isn't acting up... which means he isn't lying.
But he's pretty unsettled! The odds are really high that you can get something out of him!
I'm a magician, thank you very much!
Apollo! The only thing that changes is the witness's eyesight!
OK, so you've proven the witness has bad eyesight, and is overconfident. But that just proves he's a bad witness! It doesn't solve the case!
It changes everything, Apollo!
Remember his testimony from before... Though to be honest, I'm a little scared of where this is leading... The killer and the victim are facing each other here. Then, at the moment the killer raises his weapon... ...Mr. Stickler shouts! At which point, the victim turns his head to look... ...and the killer fires his pistol. That's why the bullet hit him in the right temple. No contradictions, right?
Completely! If Mr. Stickler shouts from where he is now... ...and the victim looks in his direction... ...the bullet would have to hit his left temple!
In other words, someone standing at point "K"... ...couldn't shoot the victim in his right temple. It's impossible!
So, now that we know that Mr. Stickler was standing on the northern side... ...the wound location takes on an entirely different meaning!
The entry wound was on the right side of the victim's head, correct? Well, the right side of the victim's head... is north.
Correct. So, if he was standing to the north... ...then the only person here who could have shot the victim in the right temple... ...was Mr. Stickler himself!
Apollo! You sure you're doing the right thing!? They'll end up convicting Wocky if you let Mr. Stickler off the hook!
Hey! Those are mine!
Oh, I remember now! He's one of the regulars in the audience at the Wonder Bar!
He's talking about my Magic Panties trick!
Apollo... There's something about the way the diagram is arranged right now... When you think about it, right near where Mr. Stickler was standing... Isn't there a...?
Really? I had fun! And Wocky made it through the day, too!
But it was good publicity! Imagine the crowd at my show tonight! You should come, Polly!
The Amazing Mr. Hat will be making an appearance!
Ah! Ms. Tiala!
That's "Mr. Charley" to you! He's been here longer, after all.
I'm sorry, Mr. Charley. He was raised by a tribe of heathens.
Mr. Charley forgives you. This time.
Apollo... Don't you know you should never ask a magician to explain a trick? I mean, you're hardly better than Mr. Stickler!
Enjoy the mystery! That's the way to appreciate magic.
I bet I'm the first magician to figure out these make great shelves!
... Don't worry, I'll clean it up soon... and then we'll try cutting you up!
Aren't those clothes the best? I had mine made to match! If you're going to be a magician, you gotta look the part!
You asked for it!
"Justice", Mr. Hat! "Apollo Justice".
Oh, you're hopeless!
Just let me know if you ever want a visit from Mr. Hat!
It's my trademark color! "Trucy Blue"!
Standing out is everything when you're up on stage! Bet you didn't know you've got your own color, too, Apollo! "Crimson Justice"!
At least it's better than being a first-rate super zero!
It was a birthday present from Daddy! I was so happy... You don't know how long I wanted one of these! I fell asleep with it, cradled in my arms, and the spaghetti bent!
...Hmm. Maybe it looks better that way?
Well... Maybe to show that there's no tricks involved?
I still think it's just that it looks better that way.
Aw, that's so sweet!
Say! Where did you and Wocky first meet, anyway?
Ah, office romance!
Ooh, a generation gap! They've even got the ever classic "what about the family business" thing going...
Mr. Gavin was saying his life might be in danger, wasn't he?
It's scary to think that a surgeon might make a mistake... ...but it's even scarier when he tries to hide it!
Apollo, I think you're only making her more nervous...
This trash can... This is where we found the mirror!
What, you aren't going to dig through it?
Oh, please, don't hold back on my account.
Why would there be a finger... Oh, you mean a toe print! Good call, Apollo!
This could be a vital piece of evidence!
Wow, I feel like the case is solved already!
Right! Let's match it! ...... Wait. The detective didn't give us a list of toe prints, Apollo.
Maybe we should ask her? Get some "expert" advice?
I'm not sure what good it's going to do us without a list of toe prints to check it on.
...Like he wanted to kill him.
It almost looks at home here in the park now. I think it should be made into a playhouse for children!
And I guess now we know it was Mr. Stickler who hid Little Plum's bloomers here, huh?
I can still remember that moment... You brandished those bloomers on high, and shouted... "Objection!"
And I can't thank you enough, Apollo!
Oh, I'm always polite! It's part of being a performer. You know what Daddy says: "It doesn't cost anything to be polite, and it could bring you more business."
Just kidding! I really am grateful!
Hmm... Looks like Wocky's out for questioning.
The other... Ah! You mean the panty-snatcher!?
He is a valuable witness!
You wanted to know the trick to my panties, right?
...?
Eh!?
Apollo! Help!
Don't say that, Apollo...
It sounds like Wocky was at the scene of the crime, after all.
Actually, they're just a normal pair of panties.
It just takes practice, that's all.
If everything that panty-snatcher said was true... ...it doesn't put Wocky in a very good position, does it?
Well, let's get investigating! No time like the present!
Hmm... One moment... ... Shazam! Allakhazam!
Ta da! That's all! Neat, huh?
Aren't my panties amazing? They were a big hit in court.
What should I show them in court tomorrow?
Yo, Little Plum! Wassup!?
You're cute when you're nervous, Polly!
He's really everything you'd expect in a Boss's son! "I'm going to be a gangster, dude!"
...
What...?
The Boss... You mean Wocky's father?
So the murder weapon was from this mansion...
...You don't look too happy about that, Little Plum.
I can see why! She's so pretty!
...?
It's like a gangsters-only version of "female intuition"!
But why the change? Is the gangster thing just not paying the bills?
I could use those in my Magic Panties act! I'll pull shivs and pieces and godfathers out of them!
Ooh! I know the feeling! I'll bet he was just as happy as I was with my plastic spaghetti!
Don't you think you should have given them that, too?
Hey, it's Mr. Eldoon! Oh Mr. Eldooooon!
What's wrong?
Ah.
"Even in death"... You mean the victim, Dr. Meraktis?
Well, we've got to check out this clinic, that's for sure.
No harm in asking! Um, excuse me!
B-But...!
That's a great story, Mr. Eldoon! A single stand, passed down from generation to generation!
That's right. You said something about that. About you "rebelling" against your pops, was it?
Can a doctor just decide to do that? What about the insurance companies...?
Can't hurt to ask, Apollo!
So Mr. Meraktis was your rival?
Don't say that!
Right! Thanks, Mr. Eldoon!
Great! Finally!
Eeek! Wh-What did you call me?
"My little imposter" sure is a strange nickname.
If you're going to drop part of that, why not drop "poster" and just call her "girl"?
...You don't look so chipper today, Wocky.
I was wondering, how did you two meet? I asked Tiala, but she was... very vague.
Wha--!?
Do you think you could tell us what happened with you and Pal Meraktis...?
And... You were shot?
But the bullet that hit you... ...it was never removed?
Sorry, I'm not up on my G things. I'm not even sure what a G thing is...
Isn't that a good thing?
Apollo, why does he keep talking about "Old Guys"?
But... you were carrying a knife, weren't you?
Wait, you didn't put him up to that? Like, you know, in the movies? "If you value your life, you'll bring the stand..."
...But I was serious!
Um... Yo, Wocky! Do you think you could tell us exactly what happened that night?
...Look at that crowd over by the park!
But... why are those girls screaming? I think I just heard one say "Omigod, it's him!"
Um, so you were here investigating?
Too bad! It looks like such a nice bike, too. Hard to believe that it could break just from that!
Well, nothing to do but head on in. Let's hit the park, Apollo!
The blue tarps are gone! Maybe that's it?
The white-frocked detective from yesterday. She seems to be apologizing reverently... to the trash can.
You seem as gloomy as ever.
Glimmerous...? Does she mean Prosecutor Gavin?
I wonder why Detective Skye put them out?
Oh! You know, I think I see something there... a print!
How do you know my daddy!? I want details!
I've always thought that, too!
...
What is it? I see a roller... and glue?
Oh, does that have anything to do with those blue tarps?
Ah ha! So with that kit...!
Ooh! I'm good at stuff like this! I used to make magic bunnies out of paper mache!
Aww, I want to try! It'll be just like making pancakes in the dirt!
She's reading the instructions for her kit...
Ooh! This is so exciting!
Wow! I can almost see the science at work!
...Huh. That's a funny shoe print. Is that even a shoe?
It is a shoe print of some kind though, that's certain.
It's right next to the Eldoon's Noodles stand!
Something's familiar about that smooth surface... so smooth it's almost slippery.
I think she means you picked the wrong evidence, Apollo.
Wait, that means... ...that someone from the clinic was involved?
Um, Detective Skye? I have a favor to ask!
The police won't let us in! They say the murder and the clinic are not connected. And it's off limits until we prove they are!
Thank you, Detective Skye!
Still, it might be useful somehow! Let's analyze it!
She put a little heart by her name! How cute!
Apollo! Shame on you! Cute is eternal! Cute is timeless! No matter how old a woman gets she always carries a little innocent madien inside her!
When I sign my name, I always put in a little diamond! "Trucy ◇ Wright"... See? Cute, don'tcha think?
Hey! You could write your name like "Apollo {{{2}}} Justice"!
Well, the time of the decision is upon us! Which one of our two jailbirds do we want to talk to?
I guess we'll be back then!
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you! Look what we have!
Thanks, Mr. Officer! Let's hit it, Apollo!
Huh, kind of an at-home sort of place, isn't it?
The police guy out front wasn't so sure.
There might be some clues lying around! Let's get cracking, Apollo!
Look at all these bowls...
Then, I think we've figured something out.
Mr. Eldoon must do take-out!
All the bowls have been washed clean...!
That was pretty intense, wasn't it!?
But, Apollo... What would we have said if we did see them? We can't exactly shout out "Hey! Who are you!?"
Let's think of something cool to say for the next time we do meet a burglar!
There's a single pair of sandals here.
Or maybe it's a visitor that's come to see Dr. Meraktis.
Why'd they leave without their shoes?
It's a little scary... when you stop to think about it. And how did the lady go home without her sandals?
Oh, I've heard of those! Surgical enhancements, right?
These must be the slippers for patients at the clinic.
Look, a single pair is missing from the rack here, too. And ours have paint on the bottoms... Which means they were taken out of here on the night of the murder.
Hey, Apollo! You think this is...?
Maybe we can get a print off of this! Let's try it out!
But wait! I mean, it's great that we got the print... But is there such a thing as a list of toe prints?
This seems like a good time to ask a detective's advice.
I'm not sure what good it's going to do us without a list of toe prints to check it on.
Look! This door says "Doctor's Office"!
It's not locked... Too bad.
I like opening locks! It's kind of a hobby of mine. Like those little bike locks? Don't even bother putting them on when I'm around!
......! Ah... Apollo! That sound... It came from behind this door!
Wait, Apollo! You're too late to catch them now!
Let's check the room out, first, Apollo! If we call the police now, we'll lose our chance!
Well, one thing's for certain. This clinic and our murder case are looking pretty related now!
Eeeeek! Something's moving inside that one! ...You look, Apollo!
Wow, they're all fish! So many kinds!
Kind of an expensive-looking lamp, isn't it? Hey... The bulb's broken.
No. Our cat burglar must have dropped it.
Hey, look at the cord...
It's a little bright for blood. Almost pinkish.
Maybe the burglar dropped it.
It's bit peculiar [sic], isn't it...?
That must be how our burglar escaped!
Maybe it was just a burglar who happened to pick here?
I'd give it a month, myself.
Wow, what a mess. This is worse than Daddy's room! The burglar must have left in a hurry.
So, the messy one wasn't our burglar just now!
What doesn't?
That's true! That's what I would do! If I were a burglar.
Maybe they were looking for the key to the safe?
Then maybe the burglar was looking for the house keys!
What a cute little safe!
...! Someone's already entered in two numbers, Apollo! 7...9... Wait, do you think...
Hmm, is there any way we can figure out the last two numbers?
Maybe there's something in the Court Record? Something that can help us figure out the last two numbers!
Well, I suppose... If only there was something that could finger which buttons had been pressed!
I knew it, Apollo! What is it?
... I'm not sure how that's going to help us.
If only there was something that could finger which buttons had been pressed!
It would leave a print!
We'll have the safe code! Not bad, Apollo!
These are glove marks. The burglar must have been wearing gloves.
Let's enter the code, Apollo! We know the first two numbers are 7 and 9!
Hmm, you can still see the bullet sticking out of it.
Hey, the bullet came out! The tip is all squished.
This looks like... a medical chart. There's an X-ray in here with it.
But, the names are easy enough to read. Look, by "Patient" it says... "Wocky Kitaki"! So this is Wocky... our client's chart, huh.
What is it, Apollo?
Let's see... "Nurse Alita Tiala"...!
That's one "ita" too many, Apololo!
How should I know? Though... I guess it means she's on staff at this clinic?
I'm sure she had her reasons.
You got the "I" and "Y" wrong, Appolo!
Oh? How is it broken...?
Eeeek!
M-My finger!
...Magic blood! Tee hee! Gotcha!
Wait! I know! Maybe it was left there by a red marker! Like, they were trying to write their name, and slipped.
I used to write my name on my magic ropes...
Wow! It's all mushed!
You know, it looks kinda yummy.
...Like ice cream! Mmm-mmm! Caramel!
Hey, how did you know?
Let's ask Detective Skye to help us, Apollo!
I still think it's kind of odd...
Detective Skye, I was wondering about this...
What?
Ooh! Clever, Apollo!
Detective Skye, I was wondering about this...
What?
Oh, right! We can use this in the trial tomorrow!
Too bad we don't know whose toe it is.
It's got a toe print on it, doesn't it?
We found them in the lobby at the Meraktis Clinic!
Still, it might be useful somehow! Let's analyze it!
Too bad we don't know whose toe it is.
It's got a toe print on it, doesn't it?
You know, I thought that's what it might mean! Science is amazing!
But what if you're found guilty of murder!?
...You didn't really do it, did you?
I heard he wants to leave the mob?
...The Meraktis Clinic?
What did she say?
This health check-up was the Boss's idea, you said?
But didn't you learn about the bullet at that check-up?
For... Ms. Tiala?
So these sandals are hers...
I don't think he gets it, Apollo...
So, you met Ms. Tiala when you...
Something wrong?
Mr. Eldoon! We've been looking all over for you!
Apollo! Show him what we found! Nothing like expert advice!
Why the sudden silence, Mr. Eldoon?
He's on trial... On suspicion of murder.
...ABD?
What...?
Y-You mean...
Um... I'm only up to making rabbits disappear. I haven't learned bullets yet.
How could Dr. Meraktis do such a terrible thing? How could he just leave that bullet in there?
Despair...
The Kitakis...
How awful...!
That's just horrible! He left Wocky to die!
... You were a surgeon, right Mr. Eldoon!? You could operate on Wocky, couldn't you!?
What...?
So... So Wocky...
No...!
Apollo?
That's right! This operation was how they met.
Ah...
What was she thinking!? Apollo?
This is it, the big day! Did you get any sleep?
Oh? What time did you wake up?
That's only two hours, Apollo... But, at least you have me! ...And the Amazing Mr. Hat!
Daddy! Do you know who Prosecutor Gavin's witness is today?
Hmm... How about Little Plum?
That's too bad. You know, speaking of moms... You need to find me a new mommy one of these days, Daddy!
But that seems odd... Why would she testify against her own fiancé?
Well, not to worry. I've got my panties back. If we can't find a killer, I'll pull one out of there!
Guilty of panty-snatching!
How can you prove something like that?
Rifling marks...?
Whaaaa--! The Boss and his wife!?
Apollo! That can't be right! Why would they want to frame their only son!?
...He's speechless, Apollo. The judge is speechless.
Poor Ms. Tiala... I can't imagine what it would be like to be in her position!
You know what I'm starting to think? I'm starting to think that the police never looked inside that safe.
What is it, Apollo?
Your bracelet...?
But... I can't see anything, Apollo.
Wait, maybe... Yes, that has to be it!
Your senses, Apollo... They must be sharper than mine!
I can't see it, but you can sense it!
Listen to me, Apollo! There's a weak point somewhere in Ms. Tiala's testimony! But we don't know what her nervous habit is.
You have to perceive it yourself, Apollo! With your eyes... and your senses!
Amazing, Apollo! I didn't see it at all! Daddy was right about you!
You're still close! Keep on her, Apollo!
...Sounds like the judge had quite a fright.
But what about the mess we found? Something definitely happened in that office, Apollo!
Well, let's try putting some evidence up anyway!
Do you know why she went, Apollo?
I guess the police didn't check that far.
What are you talking about!?
You had the most to lose if that chart was found!
W-Well, you could have taken Wocky's!
What... What point!?
Oh...
Ack!
......! Ah... Apollo! That sound... It came from behind this door!
But the police didn't check the safe, did they?
She's trying to push all the blame on Wocky! And she's getting away with it!
I always have a glass of milk for breakfast.
That would make Wocky the killer, Apollo! Geez!
A-Are you sure, Apollo?
Apollo! I think I might be on to something!
I think I've figured out one of our pieces of evidence! In order to make room in the stand, some things would have to be...
When I die, it will be by disappearing mysteriously in the middle of a magic act!
Apollo... any word from your bracelet?
I couldn't see a thing! It's up to you, Apollo!
I don't know what to think anymore, Apollo... I mean, is that it? Do we know everything we need to know about Ms. Tiala?
He's right! There is more we don't know!
Even still, what if it was her in that noodle stand!
What if it's all true!? We might have already figured out what truly happened that night!
And Ms. Tiala heard about this from Wocky. So she went to the Meraktis Clinic ahead of him! ...In order to get rid of the chart with her signature!
Maybe... because the stand was heavy?
You're the one who's dreaming! Apollo's backed up everything he's said with facts! If you're so sure he's making it up, give us another reason! Why was Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand through the park!?
Um... I have an idea! You know that green car? I bet it wouldn't run! It was broken!
Eh...
Daddy...?
All sorts of things come out of my panties! ...Even the truth.
Um, so you were here investigating?
Too bad! It looks like such a nice bike, too. Hard to believe that it could break just from that!
That's why Dr. Meraktis had to use the noodle stand! It was the next closest thing he could think of!
Prosecutor Gavin sure seems calm for someone who just lost...
Great job, Apollo! You did it!
Wocky's off the hook... ...free to become the gangster he's always wanted to be! And he has you to thank...
...Or to blame, I guess.
...I'm afraid the guard is going to throw them both out.
Hey, maybe we can help them out! We know why Mr. Kitaki needs to make so much money... Maybe we should tell Wocky. Oh, Wocky? Apollo has something to tell you!
Show him the reason why, Apollo!
...Little Plum?
Wocky...?
My! Wocky!
Well, let's head back, Apollo! To the Wright Anything Agency!
Aw, we make a good team! Don't just stand there, let's get going!
Oh, that's right! We have to go someplace first!
Why, to claim our reward from Mr. Eldoon!
Oh, and after that, you can come see my show! With a special appearance by the Amazing Mr. Hat!

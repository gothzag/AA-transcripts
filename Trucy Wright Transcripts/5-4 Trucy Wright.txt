I agree with Athena. We should pick up Mr. Starbuck's defense. We have to avenge our fallen comrade! Right, Daddy?
Sure thing, Daddy! Let's be careful out there! In the meantime, I'm going to bake some cookies and fill up my magic panties for you!
Oh! She's back!
All right, you two. Let's be careful out there!
He seemed to be doing well. He was doing his Chords of Steel exercises in his room.
No... He was yelling... ..."Thank you for coming to visit me!" and "Thank you, doctor, for taking care of me!" ...and stuff like that.
What do you mean, Daddy? Is your attorney's badge somehow different? Did you bend it out of shape or something?
Hmm... Then, did you change your hairstyle? Or maybe it's your suit? I don't know. You look like you always do to me, Daddy.
I guess presenting your attorney's badge... ...is like your "quick trick," huh, Daddy?
Well, you are one of the talents in our Wright Anything Agency, after all. But I have to say that an attorney's badge won't get many laughs...
Ha ha ha! That's a good one, Daddy!
Daddy, you should be careful about showing evidence to a magician.
Well, anything up to about a yard in diameter, anyway. My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space!
Space, huh... I'd sure love to go up there someday. Will you take me, Daddy?
Well, you hardly ever take me to one of those, either! You either say, "I don't have any money" or "I don't have time"!
You're the best, Daddy!
So, you found your strategy for tomorrow's trial, huh? Good for you, Daddy!
Oh! Apollo!
Clay was your best friend, right, Apollo?
If the two of you did voice training together now, I bet you'd break a few windows!
WH-WHAT?!
"Goodbye"...? Did he just say "goodbye"...?!
